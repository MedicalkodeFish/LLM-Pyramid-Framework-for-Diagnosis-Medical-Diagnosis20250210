    {"Potential differential diagnoses": {  
        "1. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS)": "The patient's history of recurrent nausea and vomiting episodes with negative infectious workup aligns with CVS, especially as it previously contributed to hospitalization. However, the presence of coffee-ground emesis and acute hemodynamic instability does not fit the usual presentation.",
        "2. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS)": "The patient's reported use of cannabinoids, history of cyclic vomiting, and laboratory evaluations make CHS a possibility. However, the patient's symptoms (e.g., tachycardia, coffee-ground emesis) suggest acute complications beyond the scope of CHS, so it is not the leading cause.",
        "3. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)": "The patient presents with rapid pulse (165â€“210 bpm), confirmed SVT on ECG, and hemodynamic instability responsive to adenosine. SVT explains the chest pain, heart murmur, and cardiac symptoms, though it may be secondary to an underlying cause rather than the primary etiology.",
        "4. Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) with GI Bleeding": "The presentation of coffee-ground emesis raises the suspicion of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a hallmark of PUD. However, no mention of risk factors like NSAID use, H. pylori infection, or confirmed ulcers discounts this as the main diagnosis.",
        "5. Thyrotoxicosis or Thyroid Storm": "Symptoms such as tachycardia, tremors, agitation, psychomotor dysfunction (labile affect, pressured speech), and weight loss raise suspicion for thyrotoxicosis. However, the absence of other classic signs like fine hair, heat intolerance, or prior history of hyperthyroidism makes this less likely without confirmatory thyroid-specific testing."  
    }}, 

    {"Most Likely Main Diagnosis": "Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia secondary to Fentanyl/Oxycodone Overdose and Polysubstance Use Disorder", 
     "Reason": "The diagnosis of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) is confirmed by ECG showing SVT with long RP interval and termination after adenosine. The patient has a history of cyclic vomiting syndrome and polysubstance use disorder, with a positive urine toxicology screen for fentanyl, oxycodone, and cannabinoids. Tachycardia, severe agitation, and psychomotor symptoms may be attributed to stimulant-like effects seen in substance overdose, particularly opioids like fentanyl, which can acutely alter autonomic function and contribute to arrhythmias. Additional findings, including coffee-ground emesis (possible stress-induced gastritis or opioid-induced ileus with GI bleeding), align with the systemic impact of overdose. The cardiac presentation and acute symptom severity prioritize SVT as the main diagnosis driven by her polysubstance use and resultant autonomic instability."}
