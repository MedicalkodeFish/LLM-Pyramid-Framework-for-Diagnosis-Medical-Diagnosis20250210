**Analyzing symptoms**
I’m mapping out a 39-year-old woman with cyclic vomiting syndrome, polysubstance abuse, and a history of nephrolithiasis, presenting dark-brown fluid vomit, tachycardia, and elevated anion gap.
**Piecing together observations**
I'm considering the cyclic vomiting syndrome triggered by stress, recent smoke inhalation without carbon monoxide symptoms, and the significance of left lower abdominal pain likely related to menses.
**Recalculating anion gap**
Recalculating the anion gap, it’s 30, indicating high anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly from lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, or toxin ingestion, despite typical metabolic alkalosis in cyclic vomiting syndrome.
**Evaluating potential causes**
I'm looking at elevated alkaline phosphatase, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and coffee ground emesis, likely due to a Mallory-Weiss tear, htat could indicate a severe GI bleed.
**Consider the possibilities**
Hmm, I’m thinking about smoke inhalation poisoning, thyrotoxicosis from weight loss and symptoms, and atrial tachycardia from catecholamine excess due to excessive vomiting.
**Evaluating differential diagnosis**
I’m digging into acute gastroenteritis with Mallory-Weiss tear, or an acute exacerbation of cyclic vomiting syndrome, with arrhythmia possibly triggered by vomiting-induced hypovolemia.
**Piecing together symptoms**
I’m connecting the dots: cyclic vomiting syndrome likely triggered arrhythmia. Coffee-ground vomitus hints at a Mallory-Weiss tear from intense vomiting and stress-induced hypovolemia.
**Piecing it together**
I’m grappling with cyclic vomiting syndrome-induced arrhythmia, indicative of a Mallory-Weiss tear. The high anion gap and positive ketones suggest ketoacidosis, aligning with her stress-induced tachycardia.
**Assessing complications**
Evaluating the likely diagnosis of an acute exacerbation of cyclic vomiting syndrome with Mallory-Weiss tear and supraventricular tachycardia, considering stress-induced hypovolemia, catecholamine surge, and potential toxin ingestion.
**Assessing possibilities**
I’m thinking through cyclic vomiting syndrome exacerbation with secondary complications like Mallory-Weiss tear and supraventricular tachycardia, linked to hypovolemia, catecholamine surge, or substance withdrawal.
**Evaluating potential triggers**
I'm focusing on cyclic vomiting syndrome complexed by Mallory-Weiss tear and supraventricular tachycardia due to hypovolemia and catecholamine surge. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and recent cannabinoid use are also considered.
**Mapping out compulsive behavior**
I'm exploring potential triggers for cyclic vomiting syndrome, such as recent cannabinoid use or smoke inhalation, and considering acute exacerbation linked to these factors or menstruation.
**Piecing together diagnoses**
Current findings point to the exacerbation of cyclic vomiting syndrome with Mallory-Weiss tear and supraventricular tachycardia due to hypovolemia and catecholamine surge, with other conditions less likely.
Reasoned about potential diagnoses for patient for 16 seconds

<$[{"Potential differential diagnoses" : {
  "1. Exacerbation of cyclic vomiting syndrome complicated by a Mallory–Weiss tear": "The patient has a known history of cyclic vomiting syndrome. In this episode, her profuse vomiting—producing coffee‐ground emesis—is highly suggestive of a mucosal tear (Mallory–Weiss tear) from forceful retching. Negative imaging and stool studies help rule out other intraabdominal causes.",
  "2. Supraventricular tachycardia secondary to hypovolemia and sympathetic surge": "The documented SVT with a long RP interval is likely not a primary arrhythmia but a secondary response to volume depletion and catecholamine release from the severe vomiting episode.",
  "3. Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome": "Although the patient has used cannabinoids recently, her longstanding pattern of cyclic vomiting syndrome and prior similar episodes make this etiology less likely to be the primary driver.",
  "4. Inhalational injury from smoke exposure": "Her recent exposure to smoke could contribute to systemic symptoms; however, the clear chest radiograph and lack of pulmonary findings argue against significant inhalational injury as the cause of her presentation.",
  "5. Thyrotoxicosis-induced arrhythmia": "While hyperthyroidism can precipitate tachyarrhythmias and gastrointestinal upset, there are no specific clinical or laboratory findings (such as thyroid function tests) to support this diagnosis in the current context."
}},
{"Most Likely Main Diagnosis": "Exacerbation of cyclic vomiting syndrome complicated by a Mallory–Weiss tear", "Reason": "The patient’s recurring history of cyclic vomiting syndrome, coupled with an episode marked by severe retching resulting in coffee‐ground emesis, strongly supports a diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome exacerbation with a complication of Mallory–Weiss tear. This diagnosis accounts for both her gastrointestinal symptoms and the secondary cardiovascular effects (SVT) observed due to hypovolemia and sympathetic activation."}
