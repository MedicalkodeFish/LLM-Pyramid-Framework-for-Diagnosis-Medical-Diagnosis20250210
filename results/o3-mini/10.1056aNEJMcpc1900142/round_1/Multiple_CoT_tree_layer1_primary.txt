### Analysis:

1. **Symptoms**:
   - The primary symptoms include nausea, vomiting (with coffee-ground material), abdominal pain (left lower quadrant), tachycardia, and fever. Additionally, there is evidence of dehydration, labile affect, and tremors.
   - There are historical symptoms of cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), which have previously led to similar presentations.
   - The onset of menses, along with the use of cannabis and a history of substance use, also form critical context.

2. **Laboratory and Imaging Findings**:
   - Laboratory findings include mild leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), mild anemia, and slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase. The presence of ketones and blood in the urine suggests dehydration and possible hematuria. Importantly, the liver scan reveals hepatic steatosis, but no acute gastrointestinal or abdominal pathology.
   - CT imaging confirms non-obstructive renal calculi (kidney stones) and a finding consistent with hepatic steatosis, but no signs of acute gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction.

3. **Past Medical History**:
   - The patient has a history of cyclic vomiting syndrome, nephrolithiasis, and substance use disorder (cocaine, opiates, marijuana). She has experienced similar episodes of vomiting previously, and her symptoms seem to correlate with her menstrual cycle, which is typical of CVS.
   - The presence of psychiatric and substance use factors might also complicate the clinical picture.

4. **Assessment of Laboratory Tests**:
   - The positive urine toxicology screen for fentanyl, oxycodone, and cannabinoids supports a history of substance use, but the current symptoms do not directly align with acute drug toxicity.
   - There is no evidence of an active upper gastrointestinal bleed (normal liver function tests, no indication of significant blood loss from imaging).

### Differential Diagnosis:

1. **Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS)**:
   - **Reason for Possible Diagnosis**: The patient's prolonged cannabis use and cyclic vomiting episodes strongly suggest CHS, a condition that can cause recurrent episodes of vomiting, which resolves with cessation of cannabis use. Her symptoms improve with supportive care, which fits this syndrome's pattern. 

2. **Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS)**:
   - **Reason for Possible Diagnosis**: The patient has a history of CVS, which could explain her cyclic vomiting. However, her history of marijuana use complicates this, as the cannabis usage could be contributing to symptom exacerbation, not just the syndrome itself.

3. **Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed**:
   - **Reason for Possible Diagnosis**: The coffee-ground emesis is a classic sign of upper GI bleeding. However, her labs do not show signs of severe blood loss (no major anemia or coagulopathy), and imaging did not reveal acute GI pathology (e.g., ulcers, varices).

4. **Acute Pancreatitis**:
   - **Reason for Possible Diagnosis**: While the abdominal pain could be suggestive, the lack of typical pain and absence of pancreatic enzyme elevation makes this diagnosis less likely.

5. **Sepsis or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)**:
   - **Reason for Possible Diagnosis**: Fever and leukocytosis might suggest infection, but no clear source of infection is found on imaging, and the liver and kidneys show only mild abnormalities, ruling out this diagnosis as the primary cause.

### Most Likely Main Diagnosis:

- **Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS)**:
  - **Reason**: The patient’s history of chronic cannabis use, her recurrent cyclic vomiting, and the resolution of symptoms with supportive care align most closely with CHS. The symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and the appearance of coffee-ground material, are common features of CHS. The patient’s improvement with basic interventions like intravenous fluids and antiemetics further supports this diagnosis.

### Final Conclusion:
<$[{"Potential differential diagnoses" :
    {"1. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS)": "The patient has a strong association between chronic cannabis use and cyclic vomiting, with resolution of symptoms with supportive care and cessation of cannabis.",
    "2. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS)": "Previous history of CVS supports this, but cannabis usage complicates the presentation.",
    "3. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed": "Coffee-ground emesis suggests upper GI bleed, but the patient's imaging and lab findings do not support this diagnosis.",
    "4. Acute Pancreatitis": "No characteristic abdominal pain or elevated pancreatic enzymes to support pancreatitis.",
    "5. Sepsis or SIRS": "Lack of localized infection source and negative imaging makes sepsis unlikely."}},
    {"Most Likely Main Diagnosis": "Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS)", "Reason": "Strong association between cyclic vomiting and habitual marijuana use. Symptoms resolved with supportive care, confirming CHS as the primary diagnosis."}
