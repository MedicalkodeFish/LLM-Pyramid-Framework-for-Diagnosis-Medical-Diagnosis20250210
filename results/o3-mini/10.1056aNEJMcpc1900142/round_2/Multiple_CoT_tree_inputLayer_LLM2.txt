## Analysis of the 39-Year-Old Woman with Palpitations, Abdominal Pain, and Vomiting

**2. Symptoms, Findings, and History:**

* **Symptoms:** Palpitations, abdominal pain (left lower quadrant), vomiting (dark brown, coffee-ground emesis), severe fatigue, weakness, light-headedness, dizziness, nausea, fever (39.4°C at home, 37.2°C in ED), labile affect, rapid/pressured/slurred speech, agitation, erythema of face and chest, tremor, systolic ejection murmur.
* **Radiological Findings:** CT abdomen/pelvis: bilateral, punctate, nonobstructing renal calculi without hydronephrosis, hepatic steatosis. Normal appendix and premenopausal ovaries. Chest x-ray: clear lungs, normal cardiac silhouette.
* **Laboratory Results:**  Leukocytosis (10,030/mm3, 84.7% neutrophils), elevated alkaline phosphatase (165 U/L), ketonuria, microscopic hematuria, urine toxicology positive for fentanyl, oxycodone, cannabinoids. Elevated anion gap (30 mmol/L), slightly elevated creatinine (0.51 mg/dL), decreased potassium (3.5 mmol/L). Previous admission showed anemia (9.5 g/dL) which has improved (12.7 g/dL).
* **Previous Diagnosis:** Cyclic vomiting syndrome, polysubstance use disorder, nephrolithiasis.
* **Past History:** Asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic back pain, depression, GERD, severe dysmenorrhea, shoulder replacement, reduction mammoplasty, ovarian cyst removal. Significant weight loss (59.3 kg to 52.5 kg in 11 weeks). Recent electrical fire exposure.
* **Drug History:**  Current: acetaminophen, fluticasone, albuterol, promethazine, ondansetron, polyethylene glycol, multivitamin. Reported recent cannabinoid use. History of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and MDMA use.
* **Family History:** Unknown.
* **Travel History:** Moved from northwestern US to New England 3 years prior.
* **Sexual History:** Not explicitly stated, but presence of functional follicles on CT suggests premenopausal status.

* **a. Symptom Fabrication:** While the patient has a history of polysubstance use and dramatic behavior, the physical findings (tachycardia, fever, tremor) and laboratory abnormalities (leukocytosis, elevated anion gap) suggest a genuine physiological process is occurring.  However, the intensity of her emotional presentation warrants consideration of an underlying psychiatric component.
* **b. False Negatives:**  Given her polysubstance use history, underreporting or denial of substance use is possible, potentially leading to false negative toxicology screens.
* **c. Previous Diagnosis Accuracy:** The prior diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome may be incomplete or inaccurate.  While her current presentation shares some similarities, the constellation of findings suggests a more complex picture.

**3. Differential Diagnosis Analysis:**

* **Possible Diagnostic Directions:**  Infection (intra-abdominal, urinary tract), substance intoxication/withdrawal, metabolic derangement, endocrine disorder, psychiatric disorder.
* **Potential Diagnoses:**
    * Sepsis (possibly from a perforated viscus or UTI)
    * Opioid withdrawal
    * Stimulant intoxication
    * Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
    * Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP)
* **Rationale:**
    * **Sepsis:** Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, abdominal pain, vomiting, and leukocytosis point towards a possible infection. Coffee-ground emesis raises concern for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can occur in sepsis.
    * **Opioid withdrawal:**  Given her history of opioid use and positive toxicology screen for fentanyl and oxycodone, withdrawal is possible.  However, some withdrawal symptoms overlap with other potential diagnoses (e.g., agitation, tachycardia).
    * **Stimulant intoxication:** Her agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and labile affect could be related to stimulant use, though toxicology was negative for cocaine/amphetamine.  However, underreporting is possible.
    * **DKA:**  Ketonuria, anion gap acidosis, and altered mental status raise the possibility of DKA.
    * **AIP:** Abdominal pain, vomiting, and neurological symptoms (e.g., agitation, psychosis) can be seen in AIP, though this is less likely given the lack of specific triggers and negative family history.

**4. Most Likely Main Diagnosis:** Sepsis.  The combination of fever, tachycardia, abdominal pain, vomiting, leukocytosis, and elevated anion gap strongly suggests sepsis.  The "coffee-ground" emesis is concerning for possible gastrointestinal source, such as a perforated viscus. While opioid withdrawal and stimulant intoxication are possible contributing factors, they are less likely to fully explain the clinical picture.

**5. Reflection and Final Conclusion:**

**Analysis:** My initial focus was on the acute presentation of abdominal pain, vomiting, and vital sign abnormalities. I considered the patient's history of substance use, which introduced the possibility of withdrawal or intoxication.  The laboratory results, particularly the leukocytosis and anion gap, pointed towards a systemic inflammatory response. The coffee-ground emesis raised concern for a gastrointestinal source, such as a perforated viscus.  While other diagnoses like DKA and AIP were considered, the overall clinical picture favored sepsis. I recognize a potential bias towards prioritizing acute, life-threatening conditions.

**Final conclusion:**
