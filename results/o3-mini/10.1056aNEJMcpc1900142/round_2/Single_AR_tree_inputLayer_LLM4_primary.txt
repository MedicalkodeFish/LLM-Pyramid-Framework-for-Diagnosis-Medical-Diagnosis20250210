Cyclic vomiting syndrome": "The patient has a known history of cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is consistent with recurrent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. This diagnosis fits her prior presentation with similar symptoms."}},    "2. Drug-induced acute toxidrome": "The patient has a history of polysubstance use (e.g., fentanyl, oxycodone, cannabinoids) which could lead to symptoms like agitation, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal distress, though these are more likely secondary symptoms."}},    "3. Acute pancreatitis": "The patient's abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting could suggest pancreatitis. However, her imaging and lab results (normal liver enzymes, no findings suggestive of gallstones or pancreatic inflammation) do not support this diagnosis."}},    "4. Gastritis/Peptic ulcer disease": "Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common in gastritis or peptic ulcers, but the patient’s coffee ground vomit suggests a possible upper GI bleed, which needs further investigation. No clear signs of this on imaging or labs."}},    "5. Hepatic steatosis": "CT findings suggest hepatic steatosis, but this is less likely to be the primary cause of her acute symptoms, though it may contribute to her overall health."}},    {"Most Likely Main Diagnosis":  "Cyclic vomiting syndrome", "Reason": "The patient’s recurrent episodes of severe nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with a history of cyclic vomiting syndrome and negative findings on other tests, make this the most likely diagnosis. The presence of ongoing symptoms with negative findings on imaging and normal liver function further supports this diagnosis."}]$>
