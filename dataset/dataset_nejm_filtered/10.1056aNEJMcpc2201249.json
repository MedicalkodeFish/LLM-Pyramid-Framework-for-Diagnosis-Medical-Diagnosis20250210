    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Esperance A. Schaefer: A 56-year-old man with a history of alcohol and opioid use was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of abnormal results on liver testing.\nThree years before the current presentation, the patient had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase on routine testing performed by his primary care physician. At that time, he re- ported that testing for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies had been positive in the past. The HCV RNA level was undetectable; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cessation of alcohol use was advised. Two years before the current presentation, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase had decreased; additional laboratory test results ob- tained at that time are shown in Table 1.\nSeven months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of pain and swelling in the left wrist that had lasted for 3 weeks. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C. The volar aspect of the left wrist was erythematous and swollen, as was the left knee. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Radiographs showed subcutaneous edema of the left knee but no fracture, dislocation, or evi- dence of advanced arthropathy of the left knee or wrist. A 10-day course of pred- nisone was prescribed for presumed inflammatory arthritis. The joint swelling and pain resolved.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the same emergency department because of a painful rash. The temporal temperature was 36.3\u00b0C. The distal left forearm was erythematous and had scattered small subcutaneous nodules. Laboratory evaluation revealed pancytopenia, coagulopa- thy, and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and uric acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A plain radiograph of the left wrist showed soft-tissue edema but no abnormalities of the bone. A second course of prednisone was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist for consultation.\nTwo weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist affiliated with the other hospi- tal. He had multiple tan macules on the face and trunk, angiomas, and reddish-purple papules (some >1 cm in diameter) on the left forearm. A biopsy of a papule on the left forearm was per- formed. Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed nonspecific suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis. No microorgan- isms were identified, and culture of the biopsy specimen was negative.\nFour months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a gastroenterologist affiliated with the other hospital. He had spider angiomas and fullness of the left upper quad- rant. On a serum-based test for liver fibrosis (FibroTest), he had a score of 0.96 (with scores of 0.00 to 0.21 indicating no fibrosis and scores of 0.74 to 1.00 indicating severe fibrosis). Imag- ing studies were obtained.\nDr. William R. Bradley: Magnetic resonance\ncholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed a nodular hepatic contour with patchy perfusion but no focal hepatic lesions (Fig. 1A). Spleno- megaly, portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and perigastric, paraesophageal, and splenorenal collateral vessels were also iden- tified (Fig. 1B and 1C). There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts; the common bile duct measured 8 mm in diameter (Fig. 1D).\nDr. Schaefer: Three months before the  current\nevaluation, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Grade 2 esopha- geal varices were identified and banded. Eight days later, the patient was admitted to a second hospital because of new confusion, lethargy, delayed and slurred speech, and visual hallucina- tions. The blood ammonia level was 99 \u03bcmol  per liter (169 \u03bcg per deciliter; reference range,  11 to 60 \u03bcmol per liter [19 to 102 \u03bcg per decili- ter]). Urinalysis was normal; other  laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radio- graph was normal. Abdominal ultrasound im- ages showed persistent splenomegaly and het- erogeneous liver echotexture without ascites. A computed tomographic scan of the head, ob- tained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. An electrocardio-\n \ngram showed sinus bradycardia, a pattern con- sistent with incomplete right bundle-branch block, downsloping ST-segment depressions in the precordium, and a prolonged corrected QT interval. Treatment with lactulose was initiated for a working diagnosis of hepatic encephalopa- thy. Confusion resolved, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day with arrangements made for additional cardiac testing after discharge.\nOne month before the current evaluation, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, mild right ventricular dilata- tion, moderate tricuspid regurgitation with right atrial dilatation, and an estimated right ventric- ular systolic pressure of 71 mm Hg. Perfusion images obtained during vasodilator stress test- ing showed no evidence of inducible left ven- tricular ischemia. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for ad- ditional evaluation.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, the patient re- ported chronic dyspnea with exertion. He had no orthopnea, chest pain, or palpitations. He had consumed six beers daily for approximately 30 years but had not consumed alcohol during the previous 18 months. Three years before the cur- rent presentation, the patient had received a diag- nosis of dyslipidemia, with a blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 337 mg per deci- liter (8.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 129 mg per deciliter [1.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter]) and a total cholesterol level of 380 mg per deci- liter (9.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 155 to 199 mg per deciliter [4.0 to 5.1 mmol per liter]). He had a history of opioid use disorder, includ- ing intravenous opioids; the disorder had been in remission with the use of buprenorphine\u2013nalox- one. Other medical history included depression, insomnia, and multiple knee surgeries. In addi- tion to buprenorphine\u2013naloxone, medications included lactulose, omeprazole, and trazodone. Penicillin had caused a rash. He had worked  as  a laborer but was disabled and no longer work- ing. He had smoked two cigarettes daily for 30 years. His family history included stroke in his father, diabetes in his mother, and rheumatoid arthritis in his sister.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 73 beats\nper minute, the blood pressure 99/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 69.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.9. He was alert and oriented; asterixis was present. The lung fields were clear, and there was a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border. Abdominal examination re- vealed a palpable hard mass in the epigastrium, a finding that indicated a probable firm caudate lobe of the liver. The knees had healed surgical scars, and there was no edema in the legs. A few spider angiomas were present on the chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serologic testing was negative for antinuclear antibodies and was positive for antimitochon- drial antibodies, with a titer of 1:5120.\nFigure 1. MRCP Images.\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed with the administration of intravenous con- trast material 4 months before the current presentation. An axial T2-weighted image (Panel A) shows a periportal hyperintense signal (arrow), hypertrophy of the caudate lobe of the liver, and hepatic surface nodularity. An axial T1- weighted image (Panel B) shows cavernous transformation of the portal vein (arrow). A coronal T1-weighted image (Panel C) shows evidence of portal hypertension, including splenomegaly and upper abdominal collateral vessels (arrow). A coronal maximum-intensity-projection image (Panel D) shows mild irregularity of the intrahepatic bile ducts and prominence of the common bile duct (arrow), which measures 8 mm in diameter.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Irun Bhan: This 56-year-old man presented for an outpatient evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic because of abnormal results on liver test- ing. He reported a history of prolonged daily alcohol consumption, and he had previously re- ported a positive test for HCV antibodies. Re- sults of laboratory tests for liver function had been abnormal for at least 3 years, as evidenced by previous testing performed by his primary care physician. More recently, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly had developed. Imaging had revealed a nodular hepatic contour, which is consistent with cirrhosis, as well as evidence of portal hypertension, including splenomegaly, collateral vessels, and chronic portal vein throm- bosis. The patient had been admitted to another hospital with altered mental status associated with hyperammonemia, which had resolved with the administration of lactulose; this episode had been consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. Physical examination at this hospital revealed spider angiomas and a firm liver edge, findings that are consistent with cirrhosis.1 The first step in evaluating this patient is to consider potential causes of chronic liver disease.\nHCV Infection\nThe patient had reported a positive test for HCV antibodies. Laboratory testing confirmed the presence of HCV antibodies; this finding could be consistent with previous infection. The HCV RNA level was undetectable; this finding rules out active HCV infection. Given the absence of previous treatment, it is possible that he had spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection, which occurs in 20 to 50% of patients who are infected with HCV.2,3 Alternatively, he could have had a false positive HCV antibody test. The data do not support a history of chronic HCV infec- tion, and a previous HCV infection is unlikely to explain his chronic liver injury. The inaccurate attribution of HCV positivity can adversely affect patient care by inhibiting the search for other causes of liver disease.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe patient had consumed six servings of alco- hol daily for approximately 30 years, which places him at risk for alcohol-induced liver dis- ease.4 Although decades of alcohol consumption could explain his chronic liver disease, certain features of this patient\u2019s presentation require further examination. The elevated levels of ala- nine aminotransferase and aspartate amino- transferase obtained 3 years before the current presentation were too high to be due to alcohol- induced hepatitis. In addition, more recent labo- ratory testing revealed a markedly cholestatic pattern of liver injury, which is suggestive of a process that damages the biliary epithelium or impairs bile outflow (or both), rather than alco- hol-induced liver injury. The R factor \u2014 the ratio of the elevation in the alanine aminotransferase level to the elevation in the alkaline phosphatase level \u2014 is used to determine whether a pattern on biochemical testing is indicative of hepato- cellular injury or cholestatic injury. An R factor of less than 2 indicates a cholestatic pattern5; this patient had an R factor of 0.4.\n\nCholestatic Pattern of Liver Injury\nIn this patient, the cholestatic pattern of liver injury is unlikely to be caused by an infiltrative disease such as cancer, amyloidosis, or infec- tion, but these diseases cannot be ruled out without a liver biopsy. There is no convincing evidence that biliary obstruction is causing the cholestatic pattern of liver injury. MRCP revealed mild irregularity of the intrahepatic bile ducts, but this finding can be observed in the context of chronic liver disease. The common bile duct was considered to be dilated, given the patient\u2019s age, but this abnormality could be a conse- quence of chronic opioid use and associated in- creased pressure in the sphincter of Oddi, which would not cause clinically significant liver dis- ease.6 Echocardiography revealed elevation of the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, but the patient did not have longstanding clini- cal manifestations of heart failure, so congestive hepatopathy is unlikely to be the primary cause of liver disease. The marked elevation of the al- kaline phosphatase level and the positive test for antimitochondrial antibodies in this patient are most consistent with primary biliary cholangitis.\nPrimary Biliary Cholangitis\nPrimary biliary cholangitis (previously called pri- mary biliary cirrhosis) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by T-cell\u2013mediated destruc- tion of the small intrahepatic bile ducts. Diagno- sis is based on the presence of at least two of three criteria: biochemical evidence of cholesta- sis, with elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level, usually to a level that is more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range; the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies; and histologic evidence of nonsuppurative cholan- gitis and destruction of the interlobular bile ducts.7 This patient met the first two criteria. Although other conditions, such as congestive hepatopathy and cirrhosis, can increase the alka- line phosphatase level, the degree of elevation of the alkaline phosphatase level and the high titer of antimitochondrial antibodies in this patient support a diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis.\nSeveral other findings on laboratory testing\nand physical examination in this patient also support a diagnosis of primary biliary cholangi- tis. An increased IgM level and hypercholesterol- emia are both associated with primary biliary cholangitis; hypercholesterolemia is present in 50 to 75% of patients with this disease.8,9 The tan macules that were observed on physical ex- amination in this patient could be xanthomas associated with hypercholesterolemia. Biopsy of the purple papules on his forearm revealed granulomatous dermatitis, a nonspecific finding that is associated with systemic inflammatory disorders, which could be related to primary biliary cholangitis.10 Finally, his arthralgias are a nonspecific finding that could be due to rheu- matoid-factor\u2013negative nonerosive synovitis asso- ciated with primary biliary cholangitis.11\nIn patients with primary biliary  cholangitis,\nthe alkaline phosphatase level generally rises slow- ly to a plateau and remains relatively stable.12 In this patient, the alkaline phosphatase level ob- tained 3 months before the current presentation was lower than the level obtained 6 months be- fore the current presentation; this decrease was temporally associated with prednisone treat- ment. Glucocorticoids are not routinely adminis- tered in patients with primary biliary cholangi- tis, but some patients may have a response to\n \nsuch treatment, particularly those with an in- flammatory subtype of the disease.13,14\n\nOverlap Syndromes\nOverlap syndromes between primary biliary cholangitis and other immune-mediated diseases have been recognized. In this patient, the granu- lomatous dermopathy and possible response to prednisone suggest the possibility of an overlap syndrome between primary biliary cholangitis and sarcoidosis.15 Although a positive test for antimitochondrial antibodies is highly specific for primary biliary cholangitis, this result has also been reported in patients who have sarcoid- osis and do not have primary biliary cholangi- tis.16 However, abdominal imaging in this patient did not reveal any findings that were suggestive of sarcoidosis. The particularly high levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate amino- transferase obtained 3 years before the current presentation suggest the possibility of an overlap syndrome between primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Results of tests for auto- antibodies (e.g., anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies) that would support the diagnosis of autoim- mune hepatitis are not available.\n\nPortal Hypertension\nThis patient had findings on physical examina- tion and imaging that were suggestive of under- lying cirrhosis with associated portal hyperten- sion. However, patients with primary biliary cholangitis can have presinusoidal portal hyper- tension (and related complications) before the development of cirrhosis. Such presinusoidal portal hypertension can be due to injury of the portal tracts. It can also be due to the develop- ment of nodular regenerative hyperplasia, which is characterized by alternating patches of regen- erative and atrophic hepatocytes.17,18\n\nPortopulmonary Hypertension\nThe elevation of the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure on echocardiography is sugges- tive of pulmonary hypertension. It would be important to further evaluate the patient for pulmonary hypertension and its cause by per- forming right heart catheterization. Portopul- monary hypertension \u2014 pulmonary arterial hy- pertension that occurs in the presence of portal\nhypertension and in the absence of other causes\n\u2014 would be my greatest concern. Portopulmo- nary hypertension is associated with mortality that is higher than the risk predicted by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, the measure used to determine status on the waiting list for deceased-donor transplantation in the United States, so affected patients may be eligible for a MELD exception score that raises their status on the waiting list.19 However, mod- erate and severe portopulmonary hypertension is associated with increased perioperative mortal- ity and must be treated before proceeding with transplantation.20 I suspect that the diagnostic test in this case was a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis and as- sess the underlying stage of liver disease.\n\n",
