    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David J. Bozym (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital be- cause of hypokalemia and paranoid thoughts.\nSix months before the current admission, discomfort on the right side of the chest developed, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital.\nDr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1), performed\nafter the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a nodule in the upper lobe of the left lung that measured 2.1 cm by 1.9 cm, as well as bulky me- diastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.\nDr. Bozym: An endobronchial ultrasound\u2013guided transbronchial needle aspira-\ntion of a mediastinal lymph node was performed. Cytologic examination of the specimen revealed small-cell carcinoma.\nFive months before the current admission, the patient sought a second opinion in the oncology clinic of this hospital. The patient was counseled about the diag- nosis of small-cell lung cancer and the need for additional imaging before consid- eration of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy. Additional imag- ing was scheduled, along with a follow-up appointment. The patient did not undergo additional imaging and did not attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic of either this hospital or the other hospital.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient noticed swelling of both legs. Ten days before this admission, the swelling had not abated, and he was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient described himself as generally  healthy and did not report any chronic health conditions. He reported no fever, chills, shortness of breath, or pain. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s brother. The patient had been pursuing alternative treatment for small- cell lung cancer that included a strict diet and intravenous infusions, and he had not shared the diagnosis of small-cell lung  cancer with his family until several  days earlier. The patient\u2019s brother believed that the patient was in denial about the diagnosis.\nWhen the patient was 12 years of age, he had received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lympho- ma, which had been treated with radiation therapy and splenectomy. Fifteen years before this presentation, ischemic colitis had been treated with small-bowel resection. One year before this presentation, deep-vein thrombosis had been treated with a 4-month course of anticoagula- tion. There was no history of psychiatric disease. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies; he did not disclose details about the infusions that he had received as alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer. The patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents. He was divorced and frequently visit- ed his children. He worked part-time as a skilled tradesman. Family members reported that he was a lifelong nonsmoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 167/95 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The pa- tient was alert and appeared well, but he looked thinner than he had looked during his evalua- tion at the oncology clinic 5 months earlier. The abdomen had a healed surgical scar,  and  the legs had symmetric 1+ edema. The blood potas- sium level was 2.6 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.1); the white-cell count was  14,630 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis.\nDr. Murphy: CT pulmonary angiography of the\nchest (Fig. 2A and 2B), performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a marked increase in the size of the left-lung  mass, which now measured 9.3  cm  by\n4.6 cm, as well as enlargement of the mediasti- nal and hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the abdo- men and pelvis (Fig. 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed numerous new ill-defined rim-enhanc- ing hepatic lesions, which measured up to 8.0 cm in diameter; an adrenal mass, which measured\n4.1 cm by 3.4 cm; and thrombosis of the branches of the right portal vein. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was normal.\nDr. Bozym: Supplemental  potassium  was ad-\nministered intravenously and orally, and the pa- tient was admitted to this hospital. During the next 3 days, additional supplemental potassium was administered. During follow-up interviews, the patient acknowledged the diagnosis of small-\ncell lung cancer, but he did not explain why he had not shared the diagnosis with his family or provide details about the alternative treatment that he had pursued. On the fourth hospital day, the blood potassium level increased, and the patient asked to go home. He stated that he was willing to attend follow-up visits at the oncology clinic, but he was evasive when chemotherapy and immunotherapy were discussed. The patient was discharged.\nOne week after discharge, and 1 day before the current admission, the patient\u2019s father accompa- nied the patient to receive massage therapy and an intravenous infusion as alternative treatment. During the infusion, the patient abruptly be- came volatile, agitated, and angry. On the drive home, he refused to close the window and stared into the distance. He stated that doctors had cast spells on him during his recent hospi- talization and that he had killed his oldest child, which was not true.\nThe next day, the patient borrowed his broth- er\u2019s car without permission and drove across the state. After he returned home, family members brought the patient to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient stated that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d for being in the hospital. He initially reported no symptoms, but on specific questioning, he acknowledged fatigue, weight loss, generalized weakness, de- creased appetite, and ongoing leg swelling. He reported that he did not feel confused, afraid, or worried and that he had no suicidal or homicidal thoughts or auditory or visual hallucina- tions. Additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family members. The patient had not slept for several days. His aggressive and erratic behavior and delusions were not typical, although he could become easily angered and had a long- standing belief that his doctors had adminis- tered radiation therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lym- phoma to make money.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 194/106 mm Hg, and the pulse 87 beats per minute. The patient alternated be- tween being alert and lethargic, and he could state the names of his children but not their ages. He was cooperative but intermittently paused and stared; he was not distracted by ex- ternal stimuli, but he seemed to be responding to internal stimuli. He spoke only a couple of words at a time and answered most questions by nodding or shaking his head. There was gener- alized weakness, which was most pronounced in the proximal muscle groups. The leg edema was unchanged, and the skin appeared abnormally tan; there was no scleral icterus, sublingual jaundice, or asterixis.\nThe blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter, the carbon dioxide level 37 mmol per liter (reference range, 22 to 32), and the ammonia level 51 \u03bcmol per liter (87 \u03bcg per deciliter; refer- ence range, 12 to 48 \u03bcmol per liter [20 to 82 \u03bcg per deciliter]). The white-cell count was 13,530 per microliter. Urinalysis was normal, and urine and blood toxicologic testing was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head, performed without the administra- tion of contrast material, was normal. Supple- mental potassium was administered intrave- nously and orally, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, the blood potassium level was 2.2 mmol per liter.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Chad W. Vokoun: This 49-year-old man had re- cently received a diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer. He had  pursued  alternative  treatment  and then presented to this hospital with  evi-  dence of metastatic disease. There was also hypo- kalemia, hypertension, proximal muscle  weak- ness, and darkening of his skin. Altered mental status with paranoia  prompted  family  members to bring him to the hospital and was one of the more striking aspects of his presentation. I will begin by considering the  differential  diagnosis  for his altered mental status.\n\nIntoxication or Withdrawal\nAmong patients presenting to the hospital, a common cause of altered mental status is in- toxication or withdrawal from alcohol, benzodi- azepines, or barbiturates. An intoxication or withdrawal syndrome is unlikely in this patient because he had no history of substance use disorder and had normal results on urine and blood toxicologic testing. Some medications can cause altered mental status, but this patient was not taking any prescribed medications.\n\nMetabolic Disorders\nElectrolyte abnormalities such as hypernatremia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, and hypoglycemia can cause altered mental status, but these abnor- malities were ruled out on initial laboratory test- ing. A hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state can re- sult in varying degrees of neurologic impairment.1 This patient had an elevated blood glucose level but not of the magnitude that would cause a hyperosmolar state. He also had clinically sig- nificant hypokalemia, which can be associated with constipation, palpitations, fatigue, and weakness but not with altered mental status.\nUremic encephalopathy was ruled out on ini- tial laboratory testing, which showed normal renal function. Hepatic encephalopathy and acute liver failure are important considerations in this patient because he most likely had meta- static cancer involving the liver. However, acute liver failure due to malignant infiltration of the liver is uncommon,2 and the results of liver- function tests were consistent with mild liver injury, not liver failure. Hepatic encephalopathy with mildly abnormal results on liver-function tests can be observed in patients with cirrhosis, but this patient did not have underlying cirrhosis. The elevated blood ammonia level is unhelpful; measurement of the ammonia level should not be used as either an initial diagnos- tic test or a test to direct therapy in patients with suspected hepatic encephalopathy.3 Furthermore, asterixis, which would suggest hepatic encephalopathy, was not present on examination in this case.\n\nPrimary Psychiatric Disorders\nThe patient\u2019s family members reported that the patient had long-standing concerns regarding  his doctors\u2019 motivations for administering radia- tion therapy for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but whether this belief reflects a delusion is difficult to determine. No previous episodes of halluci- nations or depressed mood had been reported. Although schizophrenia and schizoaffective dis- order are possible causes of the patient\u2019s current paranoia, other causes of altered mental status need to be ruled out before a primary psychiatric illness can be considered.\nCentral Nervous System Processes\nThis patient had mild leukocytosis on presenta- tion, which could indicate an infection involving the central nervous system, such as meningitis  or encephalitis. However, such infections are unlikely in the absence of fever. Paranoia can be caused by brain metastases, which develop in 40 to 50% of patients with small-cell lung cancer during the course of illness.4 However, MRI of the head showed no evidence of metastatic dis- ease. The patient had elevated blood pressure on presentation, and sudden increases in blood pressure can cause hypertensive encephalopathy. Hypertensive encephalopathy should be considered in patients who have markedly elevated blood pressure that abates rapidly with treatment.\nEffects of Alternative Treatment\nThis patient was receiving alternative treatment for small-cell lung cancer, but the specific type of treatment was unknown. Alternative therapy for lung cancer can include the use of a high dose of vitamin C, a strict alkaline diet, insulin poten- tiation therapy, and intermittent hyperthermia treatment. Laetrile, which is a synthetic form of amygdalin and a cyanogenic glycoside com- pound,5 has been described as an alternative cancer therapy since the 1950s, but its use has been banned by the Food and Drug Administra- tion. During the degradation of laetrile, cyanide is released and is thought to have anticancer properties.5 Although it is possible that this pa- tient was using laetrile as an alternative therapy, he did not have other symptoms of cyanide poi- soning, such as nausea, headache, or seizure.\n\nParaneoplastic Syndromes\nSmall-cell lung cancer is the cancer that is most frequently associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, which can be hormone-associated or immune-mediated.6 The paraneoplastic syndrome that best fits with this patient\u2019s clinical presen- tation is Cushing\u2019s syndrome caused by ectopic secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome can present with several neuropsychologic manifestations, including psychosis. This patient also had hypo- kalemia, hypertension, metabolic alkalosis, prox- imal muscle weakness, and skin hyperpigmen- tation (which is associated with Cushing\u2019s syndrome only when it is ACTH-dependent).\nTaken together, all these clinical features are consistent with the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s syndrome. To  establish the diagnosis in this case,   I would obtain serum cortisol and ACTH levels.\n",

    "Key testing": "serum cortisol level",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Melanie S. Haines: This patient had a random serum cortisol level of 81.5 \u03bcg per deciliter  (2249 nmol per liter). For context, random se- rum cortisol levels obtained from patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), in whom maximal ac- tivation of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis is expected, range from 5.3 to 40.7 \u03bcg per deciliter (146 to 1123 nmol per liter).7 We confirmed that the patient had had no exogenous glucocorticoid exposure.\nCortisol is a hormone that is secreted in a pulsatile manner under the direction of pituitary ACTH and according to a diurnal cycle, with the level reaching a nadir at approximately 12 a.m.8 In patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, diurnal variation is lost and late-night cortisol levels are inappropriately elevated. In the outpatient set- ting, a late-night serum cortisol level of 7.5 \u03bcg per deciliter (207 nmol per liter) or greater has high sensitivity and specificity for distinguish- ing Cushing\u2019s syndrome from physiologic hypercortisolism.9 We therefore recommended obtain- ing a serum cortisol level at 12 a.m., with the understanding that physiologic hypercortisolism is greater in the hospital setting than in the outpatient setting. The 12 a.m. serum cortisol level in this patient was 84.7 \u03bcg per deciliter (2337 nmol per liter), a finding that confirmed the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\nCushing\u2019s  syndrome could explain most,  if\nnot all, of this patient\u2019s presenting symptoms and signs: neuropsychiatric disturbances, includ- ing psychosis and insomnia; cardiovascular and mineralocorticoid effects, including hyperten- sion, hypokalemia, and edema; hyperglycemia; and proximal myopathy, which can be worsened by hypokalemia.10 Hypokalemic metabolic alka- losis, which was also present in this patient,occurs in 10 to 15% of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome due to secretion of ACTH from a pitu- itary tumor and in more than 95% of patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome due to ectopic secre- tion of ACTH from a nonpituitary tumor.11 In the kidney, the hormone 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehy- drogenase 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) inactivates cortisol to cortisone, thus preventing it from activating the  mineralocorticoid  receptor.  However, very high cortisol levels overwhelm the activity of 11\u03b2-HSD2, enabling cortisol to activate the min- eralocorticoid receptor, which results in sodium resorption and potassium excretion.\nAmong patients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, the risk of venous thromboembolism is approximate- ly 18 times as high as the risk in the general population.12 This patient had a history of deep- vein thrombosis, although it had occurred 1 year before the current admission and 6 months be- fore the diagnosis of small-cell lung cancer. Cushing\u2019s syndrome typically causes truncal obesity, but patients with ectopic Cushing\u2019s syn- drome due to cancer can present with weight loss. Cushing\u2019s syndrome has been associated with hyperpigmentation, including darkening of the skin in areas that are not exposed to the sun, that occurs when high levels of ACTH precur- sors stimulate melanocyte receptors. In addi- tion, Cushing\u2019s syndrome can cause neutrophil- predominant leukocytosis.\nAfter the diagnosis of Cushing\u2019s syndrome\nwas established in this patient, the next step was to determine whether he had ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent Cushing\u2019s syndrome. We had a very high clinical suspicion for Cushing\u2019s syndrome due to ectopic secretion of ACTH, both because it is a known paraneoplastic syndrome associated with small-cell lung  cancer and because of the severity of the patient\u2019s presentation.\nThis patient had plasma ACTH levels of 264 pg per milliliter and 223 pg per milliliter (reference range, 6 to 76), findings that confirmed the di- agnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing\u2019s syn- drome. Typically, MRI of the pituitary gland would be the next step because ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas are more common than ec- topic sources of ACTH. However, recent imaging of the head in this patient had revealed no obvi- ous sellar abnormality. Ectopic secretion of cor- ticotropin-releasing hormone can stimulate pituitary secretion of ACTH, but because this process is exceedingly rare and would not change our management approach, we determined that ec- topic secretion of ACTH was the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s ACTH-dependent Cushing\u2019s syndrome.\n",
