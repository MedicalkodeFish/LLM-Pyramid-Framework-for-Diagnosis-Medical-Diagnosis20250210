    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Marisa L. Winkler: A 22-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of pain and rapidly spreading erythema of the left hand.\nThe patient had been well until the day of admission, when he awoke with pain and swelling of the left hand that involved the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger. Over a period of several hours, the pain progressed and bullae began to form. He began to have pain with movement of the second and fourth fingers, and the bullae turned dark purple; these changes prompted the patient to present to the emer- gency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain of the left hand that worsened with movement of the second and fourth fingers. There was no lethargy, fatigue, headache, dyspnea, cough, or pain elsewhere. The patient had no notable medical history and had been well before the day of presentation.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 126/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There were two violaceous, tender bullae on the dorsal as- pect of the left hand \u2014 one on the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger, each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Fig. 1). In addition, there was nontender, streaking erythema spreading across the dorsal aspect of the left hand, the volar aspect of the left forearm, and the medial aspect of the left upper arm into the axilla. There was no axillary lymphadenopathy.\nOn further examination of the left arm, the soft-tissue compartments were soft and compressible, without evidence of crepitus. Finger flexion and extension were intact but limited by pain and swelling in the second and fourth fingers. Results of motor and sensory examinations were normal. The hand was warm. The radial pulse was palpable, and the capillary refill was brisk. The remainder of the overall physical examination was unremarkable. A blood specimen was obtained for culture, a complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. Initial laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Arvin Kheterpal: Computed tomography (CT) of the left hand and arm, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal soft-tissue swelling overlying the distal interphalangeal joint of the second finger and the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth finger on the dorsal aspect of the left hand (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of osseous erosion, periosteal reaction, fracture, joint effu- sion, fluid collection, or subcutaneous air. The left forearm had a normal appearance on imaging.\nDr. Winkler: While the patient was in the emer- gency department, additional history was ob- tained. The patient was not taking any medica- tions and had no known allergies to medications. He had recently graduated from college and was seeking employment. He lived with his parents in a suburban area of New England. There was no history of recent travel or sick contacts. He rarely drank alcohol and did not smoke ciga- rettes or use illicit drugs. There was no notable family history.\nThe patient had recently begun practicing taxidermy as a new hobby. Four days before pre- sentation, he received a frozen deer hide from a friend, which he began to prepare for tanning. When he first received the deer hide, he scraped the skin and fur to remove numerous ticks. On the day before presentation, he kneaded the hide with his hands and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water that had been pre- pared the day before and left to stand overnight.While the patient was working with the animal hide, he did not wear protective clothing or gloves. His mother had assisted in part of the process but remained well.\nIntravenous fluid, ceftriaxone, and vancomy- cin were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. Consultants from the orthopedic hand service, dermatology, and in- fectious diseases evaluated the patient. A diag- nostic test was performed.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs.\nPhotographs of the patient\u2019s left hand show violaceous bullae on the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth digit (Panel A) and the distal interphalangeal joint of the second digit (Panel B), each measuring 7 mm by 3 mm (Panel C).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lisa G. Winston: In developing the differential diagnosis in this case, it is helpful to consider several key points about this patient\u2019s medical and social history, his relevant exposures, and his clinical presentation. The patient was a healthy young adult who had not been taking any medications, so coexisting medical condi- tions would not be expected to play a role. He lived in a suburban area of New England and had no risk factors related to travel, sick con- tacts, employment, or health-related behaviors. The compelling aspect of his exposure history is that 4 days before admission, he had scraped a frozen deer hide to remove ticks without the use of gloves. He had also kneaded the hide and massaged into it a mixture of deer brain and tap water on the day before admission.\nThe patient had been well until the day of\npresentation, when a locally progressive process involving his left hand and arm developed. The process was characterized by pain, swelling, and bullae of the hand, along with streaking erythema that had spread up the arm. The physical examination was otherwise notable only for fever and mild tachycardia, and the patient appeared well. The laboratory evaluation was largely nor- mal, except for a slightly elevated neutrophil count. A CT scan showed soft-tissue swelling involving the dorsal aspect of the left hand but no evidence of a deeper process. On the basis of the information provided in the case description and the clinical photographs, I would describe the patient\u2019s illness as an acute cellulitis with hemorrhagic bullae and streaking erythema that developed after exposure to a deer hide and pos- sible minor trauma associated with vigorous scraping. Given the patient\u2019s appearance, the time course of the illness, and the absence of signs and symptoms suggestive of a preexisting or con- current systemic condition, the cause is likely to be a local infection. Although the exposure to deer brain is intriguing, there are no organisms specifically associated with this tissue that cause cellulitis, and the incubation period would have been quite short.\n\nSkin and Soft-Tissue Infections\nBefore we discuss infectious pathogens associ- ated with deer and deer hides, we should con- sider typical human pathogens that cause skin and soft-tissue infections. Beta-hemolytic strepto- coccus, especially group A streptococcus (Strep- tococcus pyogenes), is the most common cause of cellulitis, and blistering and lymphangitis may occur. Staphylococcus aureus can cause cellulitis, but a purulent infection of the skin and soft tis- sue usually develops.\nIt is appropriate to provide antibiotic coverage targeting typical causes of cellulitis while an evaluation for more unusual organisms is in progress. Although there is a long list of zoo- noses that are potentially associated with expo- sure to deer, the most relevant infections to consider are those that manifest with skin le- sions, those that have a relatively short incuba- tion period, and those that may be transmitted during contact with a frozen deer hide.\nPlague\nCould this patient have an infection with Yersinia pestis, known as the plague? This infection has multiple possible routes of transmission, includ- ing handling of infected animal tissue. Trans- mission by this route can result in bubonic or septicemic plague. Although Y. pestis can be found in deer, it is more commonly associated with other animals. In addition, since 1970, all U.S. cases of the plague have occurred in western states, except for one laboratory-acquired case.1 Bubonic plague has an incubation period of 2 to 6 days, which is compatible with the time course in this case, and it can result in papules, ulcers, and eschars at flea-bite inoculation sites. How- ever, we have no reason to suspect that this pa- tient had exposure to fleas, and the skin find- ings are not compatible with buboes or with the lesions that develop at bite inoculation sites. Therefore, the plague is unlikely to account for this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nBrucellosis\nBrucellosis can be caused by multiple species of brucella. Brucella abortus is well described in deer, posing a risk of infection in hunters.2 Brucellosis can develop after skin contact with infected ani- mal tissue. The usual incubation period is 2 to 4 weeks, but it is possible for the disease to manifest in 5 days.3 Although skin findings can develop, they are relatively uncommon and typi- cally diffuse. Rashes associated with brucellosis may be papulonodular or maculopapular or may resemble erythema nodosum. In this case, neither the time course nor the skin findings fit well with the diagnosis of brucellosis.\n\n \nTularemia\nTularemia is caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Like the plague, tularemia has multi- ple possible routes of transmission, including contact with infected animal tissue. F. tularensis has been described in deer, but infection in hu- mans is usually associated with contact with other animals. Indeed, tularemia is sometimes referred to as rabbit fever.4 In patients who have the ulceroglandular form of tularemia, a skin ul- cer is present, along with a swollen lymph node; these manifestations do not match the skin findings in this case. Also, patients with tularemia usually have a systemic illness, whereas this patient appeared well, with few systemic signs and symptoms other than fever.\nOrf\nOrf, also known as contagious ecthyma, should be considered in this patient. The orf virus is in the parapoxvirus genus. Humans are infected after contact with animals directly or with con- taminated equipment. Although most cases re- sult from contact with sheep or goats, the virus has been found in deer, and transmission to a human from a deer carcass has been described.5 Humans have less commonly been infected with other parapoxviruses after animal exposure, and transmission of novel parapoxviruses to deer hunters has been described.6 After an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, orf initially manifests as a small papule and then progresses through stages involving the development of a hemorrhagic bulla or pustule. Low-grade fever and lymphangitis may be present. However, in this case, given the amount of time that had passed since the first exposure to the deer hide, one would expect to see only a papule at the time of presentation if the patient\u2019s illness were due to orf.\nAnthrax\nA diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis, fits with several fea- tures of this case, particularly the deer-hide ex- posure.7 Of the several types of anthrax, cutane- ous anthrax is the most common and least lethal. Infection usually results from handling of infected animal products. The spores can be found in soil, and hoofed animals, including deer, are most likely to host the organism. An- thrax is rare in the United States, and a vaccine is available for use in livestock. Cutaneous an- thrax manifests 1 to 7 days after exposure, ini- tially with a painless papule, which progresses to a vesicle and subsequently erodes to a pain- less ulcer with an eschar.8 Extensive edema is often present because of the production of ede- ma toxin, and lymphangitis and systemic symp- toms may occur. A hallmark of cutaneous an- thrax is that it is painless; this patient had marked and progressive pain. Thus, we should continue to look for a diagnosis that is consis- tent with all the features of this case.\nErysipelothrix rhusiopathiae Infection Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae can infect humans after animal exposure. When the infection occurs in humans, the most common presentation is a localized cutaneous disease known as erysipeloid. When the infection occurs in pigs, it can cause a disease known as swine erysipelas, which is characterized by fever, arthritis, and skin abnor- malities. The terminology is confusing because human erysipelas is a superficial cellulitis that is usually caused by group A streptococcus.9\nIn humans, most erysipeloid lesions occur on the fingers after occupational exposure to ani- mals. The infection is most common in those who handle fresh or frozen fish or crabs; slaughter- house workers, butchers, and farmers are also at risk.9 E. rhusiopathiae has been isolated from multiple animals and is widespread in the envi- ronment. In addition to infecting fish, shellfish, and swine, it can be found in cattle, horses, sheep, turkeys, chickens, cats, dogs, and other animals.10 In the literature, there is at least one report of erysipeloid occurring after the patient had slaughtered a deer.11\nErysipeloid manifests as cellulitis 2 to 7 days after exposure to E. rhusiopathiae. Violaceous and well-defined lesions are typical, and vesicles may develop. Early pain and localized swelling with- out pitting edema are thought to be characteris- tic clinical manifestations. Lymphangitis and regional lymphadenopathy may occur. Systemic symptoms are relatively uncommon with local- ized erysipeloid, but fever may occur.12 In some cases, E. rhusiopathiae may cause an infectious syndrome other than erysipeloid, such as a dif- fuse cutaneous form, bacteremia with possible seeding of distant sites, or endocarditis. On the basis of this patient\u2019s exposure history and his clinical presentation of fever, marked pain, and characteristic bullous lesions, I suspect that the most likely diagnosis in this case is erysipeloid due to infection with E. rhusiopathiae.\nE. rhusiopathiae is a nonsporulating, grampositive, rod-shaped bacterium. In the clinical microbiology laboratory, it can be visualized on Gram\u2019s staining and recovered in bacterial cul- ture, although a deep-tissue specimen may be needed. Blood cultures are rarely positive in patients with erysipeloid.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Julian A. Villalba: Two superficial swabs and a punch-biopsy specimen from the dorsal surface of the left index and ring fingers were obtained 1 day after the onset of symptoms and were submitted for routine microbiologic cultures; the biopsy specimen was also submitted for patho- logical evaluation. Because the initial clinical differential diagnosis included cutaneous an- thrax, all specimens were handled inside a biosafety cabinet in accordance with recommenda- tions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.13,14 A swab was sent to the Massachu- setts State Public Health Laboratory. Real-time polymerase-chain-reaction analysis performed for the detection of B. anthracis and B. cereus biovar anthracis nucleic acids was negative. Direct Gram\u2019s staining revealed rare neutrophils but no organ- isms. Cultures were performed in a liquid me- dium (thioglycolate broth), as well as on routine solid-based mediums, including sheep-blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar.\nMicroscopic examination of the punch-biopsy specimen revealed bullae formation and lym- phatic dilatation (Fig. 3A) associated with epi- dermal necrosis with intraepidermal microvesi- cles and underlying subepidermal edema (Fig. 3B, 3C, and 3D). There was a mixed cellular infil- trate that had periadnexal and perivascular pre- dominance but extended from the reticular der- mis to the subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 3E and 3F). The infiltrate had focal areas of necrosis and was composed of abundant histiocytes and lym- phocytes, with occasional neutrophils (Fig. 3G and 3H). These histologic features were sugges- tive of, but not specific for, an infectious derma- tosis. Special histochemical stains for micro- organisms, including a Brown\u2013Hopps stain, Steiner silver stain, periodic acid\u2013Schiff stain, and Gomori methenamine silver stain, were negative. Bacterial growth was detected in the thiogly- colate-broth culture on day 2. Bacterial colonies grew throughout the medium but were seen primarily in the top and middle parts of the tube (Fig. 4A); this feature indicates the presence of a facultative anaerobe. Gram\u2019s staining of the broth revealed long, gram-positive, nonsporulating, nonbranching, rod-shaped bacteria with fila- mentous features and rounded ends (Fig. 4B). Biochemical testing revealed that the isolate was catalase-negative and produced hydrogen sulfide when incubated on triple sugar iron agar (Fig. 4C). The isolate was subcultured on sheep- blood agar, and within 1 day of incubation, colonies with pinpoint, transparent, and alpha- hemolytic microbiologic characteristics were ob- served (Fig. 4D). Disk diffusion, a culture-based assay to semiquantitatively determine the anti- microbial susceptibility of bacteria, was per- formed. The isolate was inoculated into solid agar in the presence of a vancomycin-containing paper disk (30-\u03bcg disk), and after overnight in- cubation, the size of the zone of inhibition re- vealed resistance to vancomycin (Fig. 4E). A biochemical test panel that combined carbohy- drate fermentation tests and direct enzyme detection assays (Fig. 4F) and MALDI-TOF (matrix- assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of  f light) mass spectrometry confirmed that the pathogen was E. rhusiopathiae. Cultures of the blood specimen that had been obtained on the first day of admission were negative.\t\nZoonotic infection with E. rhusiopathiae is commonly restricted to mild cutaneous forms.15 Bacterial identification can present a challenge to the clinical microbiology laboratory, because at least two different morphotypes in colonies and on Gram\u2019s staining have been reported.16 However, accurate identification of the pathogen is critical to ensure effective antimicrobial ther- apy, because erysipelothrix species are intrinsi- cally resistant to vancomycin and many isolates can also be resistant to aminoglycosides and sulfonamides.17\n\nFigure 3. Microscopic Analysis of Skin Specimens.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining of a punch\u2011biopsy specimen of skin from the dorsal surface of the left fourth digit shows bullae formation (Panel A, arrow), lymphatic dilatation (Panel A, arrowhead), and epidermal necrosis (Panel B, arrow). At higher magnification, the epi\u2011 dermis shows intraepidermal microvesicles (Panel C) and underlying subepidermal edema with early bullae formation (Panel D). There is a dermal periadnexal and perivascular cellular infiltrate (Panel E) that extends into the adipose tissue of the hypodermis (Panel F). The infiltrate has focal areas of necrosis with associated dermal edema, and it is predominantly lymphohistiocytic, with occasional neutro\u2011 phils (Panel G). Immunohistochemical staining shows abundant cells expressing CD68, a marker of histiocytic origin (Panel H, in brown).\n\nFigure 4. Microbiologic Culture of Skin Specimens.\nA superficial swab of a skin lesion was inoculated into thioglycolate broth and incubated in an atmosphere of 3 to 5% carbon dioxide at 35 to 37\u00b0C. Panel A shows bacterial growth on day 2 throughout the medium but primarily in the top and middle parts of the tube (right tube), a classic feature of facultative anaerobic bacteria. In Panel B, Gram\u2019s staining of the colonies shows gram\u2011positive, rod\u2011shaped bacteria with nonsporulating, nonbranching, fila\u2011 mentous features. Panel C shows that the organism produced hydrogen sulfide after inoculation into a triple sugar iron agar slant tube. The production of hydrogen sulfide is indicated by the presence of ferrous sulfide (shown as a black precipitate), which is produced when ferrous ammonium sulfate (present in the triple sugar iron agar) reacts with hydrogen sulfide gas. Panel D shows that the organism developed small alpha\u2011hemolytic colonies after subcul\u2011 ture and overnight incubation on routine sheep\u2011blood agar. Panel E shows bacterial colonies abutting a 30\u2011\u03bcg van\u2011 comycin disk, a finding that indicates antimicrobial resistance. In Panel F, a biochemical test panel confirms that the pathogen is Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae.\n",
