    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Benjamin D. Medoff: A 70-year-old woman was evaluated at the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of increasing dyspnea on exertion and abnormal findings on chest imaging.\nIn childhood, the patient had eczema, recurrent episodes of bronchitis with a cough productive of mucus, and allergic rhinitis; these conditions abated in adult- hood. Twenty years before this evaluation, she had community-acquired pneumonia. Fifteen years before this evaluation, she had an inhalation exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar at a construction site near her home; she subsequently had bron- chitis that was treated with a course of nebulizers and inhaled glucocorticoids.\nTwelve years before this evaluation, the patient began to have episodes of coryza, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, and wheezing, especially in the spring or with exposure to cats, dogs, or dust. She was seen by an allergist. Skin- prick testing elicited a response to dust mites, and intradermal testing elicited a response to tree mix and dog dander. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Presumptive diagnoses of asthma and seasonal and environmen- tal allergies were made. She received prescriptions for fexofenadine, mometasone, and inhaled albuterol, to be taken as needed.\nEleven years before this evaluation, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen incidentally revealed mild mosaic attenuation \u2014 a patchy ground-glass pattern\n\u2014 at the lung bases. Ten years before this evaluation, the patient was seen by her primary care physician because of several weeks of nonproductive cough, nasal con- gestion, and intermittent wheezing; she received prescriptions for oral loratadine and inhaled pirbuterol, to be taken as needed. Eight years before this evaluation, she was referred to an allergist. She was considered to have a cough in response to angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. Six years 3 months before this evaluation, she consulted with another allergist. Results of pul- monary-function tests are shown in Table 1. The blood IgE level was 1532 kU per liter (reference range at other institution, <127), with positive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, and dust mites. Inhaled fluticasone was prescribed. Three months later, she had mild dyspnea on exertion and occasional wheezing. Pulmonary- function tests showed minimal change (Table 1); inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol was prescribed.\nFive years 9 months before this evaluation,\nthe patient was referred for pulmonary consulta- tion. She reported intermittent wheezing, mild exertional dyspnea after climbing two flights of stairs or carrying groceries, occasional gastro- esophageal reflux, and snoring. The heart rate was 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 95% while she was breathing ambient air at rest. Examination revealed upper-airway wheez- ing and was otherwise normal. After the patient climbed four flights of stairs, the heart rate was 102 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while she was breathing ambient air. Re- sults of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph was reportedly nor- mal. Blood levels of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin were normal, as was the platelet count; the white-cell count was 11,900 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the eosinophil count was 390 per microliter (reference range, <600), with a relative eosinophil count of 3.2% (reference range, 0 to 3). Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels were unde- tectable.\nDr. Amita Sharma: Chest CT, performed with-\nout the administration of contrast material, re- vealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, as well as several lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in di- ameter. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by an otolaryn- gologist. External and fiberoptic examinations, including examination of the vocal cords, were normal. A sleep study revealed mild sleep apnea, with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 7.2 events per hour (reference range, <5). The patient was un- able to receive supplemental oxygen at night and positive-pressure ventilation owing to side effects. Five years before this evaluation, the patient underwent cardiac evaluation because of ongoing dyspnea on exertion. A transthoracic echocar- diogram was normal. Results of an exercise stress test (treadmill test) were submaximal, with a maximum heart rate at 74% of the age-predicted value but without abnormal findings on electro- cardiography. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1. Three months later, the patient attended follow-up with her pulmo- nologist; inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol was sub- stituted for inhaled fluticasone\u2013salmeterol, and weight loss was advised.\nDr. Sharma: Four years before this evaluation, repeat chest CT, performed without the admin- istration of contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter. All the findings were stable from the previous CT scan. Dr. Medoff: The patient was seen by a second pulmonologist, and inhaled budesonide was substituted for inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol for the treatment of mild intermittent asthma. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 4 years before this evaluation are shown in Ta- ble 1. Subsequently, the patient was evaluated annually by her first pulmonologist, but after 3 years, she consulted with a third pulmonologist regarding recurrent dyspnea on exertion. Results of pulmonary-function tests obtained 7 months\nbefore this evaluation are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sharma: At that time, chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation and a nodule measuring 6 mm in diameter in the posterior right upper lobe, along with other, diffuse lung nodules measuring 2 to 4 mm in diameter.\nDr. Medoff: The blood hemoglobin level, plate- let count, and white-cell count were normal; the eosinophil count was 437 per microliter, with a relative eosinophil count of 4.9%. The ANA titer was 1:1280, with a homogeneous staining pat- tern. The IgE level was 2685 kU per liter (refer- ence range at other institution, <114), with posi- tive titers in response to cat dander, dog dander, dust mites, and Cladosporium herbarum. Treatment with oral montelukast and inhaled fluticasone\u2013 umeclidinium\u2013vilanterol was started, along with supplemental oxygen to be used at night and with exertion. After 1 month, the patient\u2019s symp- toms had not abated, and subcutaneous ben- ralizumab was prescribed.\nThree months before this evaluation, the patient\u2019s symptoms remained unchanged. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Ta- ble 1. One month later, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography and CT revealed no areas of abnormal FDG avidity in the lungs. Eight weeks later, the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital.\nThe patient reported intermittent wheezing and progressive mild exertional dyspnea after climbing one to two flights of stairs. She had stopped playing a team aerobic sport because of difficulty breathing. The symptoms did not abate with use of the inhaler or benralizumab; they never occurred at rest. She occasionally had a nonproductive cough without hemoptysis, and she had a \u201craspy\u201d voice that had become worse in recent months. Coryza, nasal congestion, and watery eyes were not present. She had gained 15 kg during the previous 5 years.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included eczema,\nhypothyroidism, obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperten- sion, borderline diabetes, calcium oxalate neph- rolithiasis, glaucoma, and colonic polyps. She had undergone tonsillectomy and multiple pro- cedures for the treatment of nephrolithiasis, in- cluding shock-wave lithotripsy and ureteroscopy. Medications included oral aspirin, amlodipine, atenolol, atorvastatin, atovaquone, levothyroxine, loratadine, losartan, and montelukast, along with a multivitamin; inhaled fluticasone\u2013umecli- dinium\u2013vilanterol; and subcutaneous benralizu- mab. Sulfa drugs had caused anaphylaxis, lisino- pril had caused a cough, and macrolides had\ncaused diarrhea.\nThe patient worked as an educator. She had no known exposure to asbestos, mold, solvents, or chemicals. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not have secondhand exposure to tobacco; she drank one glass of wine per week and did not use illicit drugs. She had traveled to coastal areas of Florida and Massachusetts, as well as other areas of New England, but she had not traveled to other areas of the United States or outside the country. The patient was married and lived in Massachusetts with her spouse. There had been no pets in her home for ap- proximately 10 years. There were no damp areas in her home; she used a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter and allergen-proof bedsheets.\nThe patient\u2019s family history was notable for coronary artery and peripheral artery disease in her father, a sister, and her brother; skin cancer in her mother; breast cancer in a sister; and hy- pertension and diabetes in multiple relatives. She had two healthy adult children. There was no history of allergic, immunologic, pulmonary, or rheumatologic disease.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. After she climbed two flights of stairs, the oxygen satura- tion was 87% while she was breathing ambient air. She had a cushingoid appearance. The nasal and oral mucosa appeared normal. There was no tracheal deviation or stridor. Lung auscultation revealed normal breath sounds. There was no clubbing or edema. Mild scattered eczematous plaques were present on the forearms and shins. There were mild Heberden\u2019s nodes but no other joint, skin, or nail abnormalities. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood hemoglobin level, white-cell count,\ndifferential count (with 0% eosinophils), platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and cre- atine kinase level were normal. The IgE level was 1307 IU per milliliter (reference range at this hospital, 0 to 100), and a hypersensitivity pneu- monitis panel was negative. The thyrotropin level was 8.07 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.40 to 5.00), and the aldolase level 9.3 U per liter (reference range, <7.7). The ANA titer was 1:5120, with a homogeneous and speckled stain- ing pattern; the anticytoplasmic antibody titer was 1:1280, with a filamentous and granular staining pattern; and ANCA testing was negative. A transthoracic echocardiogram was normal.\nTen weeks after evaluation, at follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, a myositis antibody panel was negative, except for a weakly positive titer in response to anti-Ku antibodies. Tests were nega- tive for ANCA, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Smith, antiribonu- cleoprotein, antitopoisomerase I (anti\u2013Scl-70), antimitochondrial, antithyroperoxidase, and anti\u2013 histidyl\u2013transfer RNA synthase (anti\u2013Jo-1) anti- bodies.\nDr. Sharma: Chest CT (Fig. 1A and 1B), per- formed without the administration of contrast material, revealed diffuse bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, includ- ing a 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or lymphadenopathy.\nDr. Medoff: Five days later, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at this hospital. A tapering course of oral prednisone was pre- scribed for the treatment of possible interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features.\nTen weeks after the visit with the rheumatolo- gist, the eczematous rash had improved but dyspnea on exertion persisted during long walks. An examination in the pulmonary clinic was notable for clear lung fields and an oxygen satu- ration of 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Results of pulmonary-function tests are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sharma: Chest CT, performed without the administration of contrast material, again showed extensive bilateral mosaic attenuation and numer- ous bilateral solid lung nodules, with the largest nodule, measuring 6 mm in diameter, located in the right upper lobe. There was no evidence of bronchiectasis or reticulation. Expiratory CT (Fig. 1C and 1D) confirmed the presence of air trapping.\n\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Richard M. Schwartzstein: This patient\u2019s presen- tation is characterized by multiple pulmonary issues that occurred over a period of nearly six decades. In her prolonged course of illness, dys- pnea appears to be the dominant problem. Therefore, I will first focus my differential diag- nosis on the possible causes of this patient\u2019s dyspnea and then integrate her laboratory and imaging findings to arrive at the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n\nDyspnea\nThe patient noted dyspnea on exertion approxi- mately 8 years before her presentation to this hospital. At that time, she was having issues related to atopy, with positive allergy tests, an elevated blood IgE level, occasional wheezing, and pulmonary-function test results consistent with moderate airflow obstruction. There is no description of the patient\u2019s characterization of the dyspnea sensation, which in many circumstances can be useful in distinguishing the un- derlying physiological derangements that might account for the symptom.1-3 Chest tightness, for example, is a common manifestation of acute bronchospasm, whereas a smothering or suffo- cating feeling is more likely to be associated with pulmonary edema.2-5 Air hunger and a sen- sation of being unable to take a deep breath can be indicative of dynamic hyperinflation associat- ed with flow limitation and a rising end-expira- tory lung volume with compromised inspiratory capacity.2,6 The patient has a longstanding his- tory of hypertension, which can lead to diastolic dysfunction and an increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure with an enhanced venous re- turn associated with exercise (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). Stimulation of pul- monary vascular receptors due to acute eleva- tions in pulmonary pressures along with acute interstitial edema could be contributing to her breathing discomfort.\nDyspnea on Exertion\nApproximately 2 years after dyspnea first devel- oped, the patient reported wheezing and exer- tional dyspnea after climbing two f lights of stairs or carrying groceries. In addition, she had a decrease in oxygen saturation after climbing stairs. Physical activity is associated with in- creased respiratory drive and ventilation, which underlies the sensation of air hunger. In the context of mechanical loading of the respiratory system, which can occur, for example, with in- creased airway resistance and decreased respira- tory-system compliance associated with dynamic hyperinflation, physical activity may also lead to a sensation of increased work and effort to breathe. This patient\u2019s exercise-related oxygen desaturation, noted approximately 6 years before presentation to this hospital, may be indicative of worsening ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, which can occur with heart failure with pre- served ejection fraction, or it may be indicative of loss of alveolar\u2013capillary surface area, which can be seen with interstitial lung disease or pul- monary vascular abnormalities. Her degree of hypoxemia, however, is not sufficient to have a major effect on her respiratory drive through involvement of the peripheral chemoreceptors or through a reduction in oxygen delivery to the tissues, which would stimulate metaboreceptors.7 In addition, the normal hemoglobin level rules out anemia as a cause of her breathing discomfort.\nWithin the next year, the patient underwent a cardiac evaluation, including an exercise stress test. Her ability to exercise was limited by a low maximum heart rate. She had a body-mass index consistent with obesity, had received a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, and was advised to lose weight; these factors are suggestive of a large body habitus and possibly of poor cardio- vascular conditioning, which is another common cause of dyspnea, particularly in patients with exercise-induced breathlessness who choose to control the symptom by avoiding physical activity. The result is often a spiral: exertional dyspnea leads to reduced activity, which results in cardiovascular deconditioning, which leads to more pronounced exertional dyspnea and thus to further reduced activity, and so forth. The patient was treated with bronchodilators for many years and ultimately received more aggres- sive therapy for asthma with an interleukin-5 inhibitor, but it is unclear whether these inter- ventions had an effect on her breathing sensa- tions; spirometry showed persistent mild-to- moderate airway obstruction.\n\nTimeline of Symptoms and Abnormal Findings on Chest Imaging\nI will now focus on the other aspects of this patient\u2019s history. From childhood to 59 years of age, she had diagnoses of atopy and reactive airway disease and was treated with antihista- mines and bronchodilators. Her pulmonary- function test results were initially characterized by a low forced vital capacity (FVC) with a nor- mal to high ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to FVC, findings that suggest a restrictive abnormality. Without the ability to assess a f low-volume loop or residual-volume measurement, I cannot tell whether there was early termination of the expiratory maneuver or air trapping that could explain her low FVC. Nevertheless, interstitial lung disease should be considered. Given her exposure to aerosolized brick and mortar, an inhalational injury should be considered, although a single exposure is unlikely to lead to occupational lung disease such as silicosis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is on the differential diagnosis and might have manifested as an acute reaction that is described in the history as bronchitis.\nSeveral years after the inhalation exposure,\nan abdominal CT scan incidentally showed bilat- eral mosaic attenuation at the lung bases. This finding could be consistent with a subacute hy- persensitivity reaction.\nWhen the patient was 61 years of age, elevat- ed IgE levels developed and pulmonary-function tests showed evidence of airway obstruction. The combination of reactive airway disease and high blood IgE levels raises concern about al- lergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or possi- bly eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangi- itis. At the time of presentation to this hospital, however, there was only borderline elevation of the eosinophil count and there were no symp- toms or findings suggestive of vasculitis.\nWhen the patient was 63 years of age, chest CT revealed bilateral mosaic attenuation, along with several small lung nodules. The negative ANCA test makes the diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis unlikely. Hyper- sensitivity pneumonitis is still a diagnostic con- sideration, although elevated IgE levels are not characteristic of this disease.\nOver a several-year period, when the patient was 65 to 68 years of age, the number of small lung nodules increased on surveillance CT scans and there was persistent mild elevation in blood eosinophil counts and IgE levels. The total lung capacity was mildly reduced, with a persistently low ratio of FEV1 to FVC; these findings are in-\ndicative of a mixed obstructive\u2013restrictive pat-\ntern on pulmonary-function tests.\nAt the time of presentation to this hospital, the patient reported worsening dyspnea. Exercise- related oxygen desaturation was greater than it had been in the past, raising concerns about progression of ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch with activity or destruction of lung tissue. Pul- monary-function tests showed ongoing airway obstruction; given the absence of cigarette smok- ing in the patient\u2019s history and her longstanding reactive airway disease, the possibility of the asthma\u2013chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome should be considered.8 Eosin- ophilia was no longer present, and a hypersensi- tivity pneumonitis panel was negative. The pa- tient was treated with systemic glucocorticoids for possible interstitial pneumonia with autoim- mune features, but there was no clinically sig- nificant change in her lung function.\nReview of a CT scan (Fig. 1) reveals the mosaic\nattenuation that has been described. On seeing this pattern, it is often difficult to determine whether the ground-glass pattern represents normal or abnormal lung and also whether there is evidence of air trapping. Expiratory scans show that the areas of relative opacity are, in fact, normal lung and that clinically significant air trapping is interspersed with the normal tissue; these features are characteristic of small-airway disease, which can either be a primary problem (e.g., constrictive bronchiolitis) or result from large-airway disease (e.g., bronchiectasis) or pa- renchymal lung disease (e.g., hypersensitivity pneumonitis). There is no evidence of bronchiec- tasis on imaging. The presence of multiple small lung nodules would not be consistent with classic constrictive bronchiolitis; there is no tree-in-bud pattern, which would suggest infectious bron- chiolitis. Small lung nodules may be seen with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but the nodules seen in patients with hypersensitivity pneumoni- tis tend to be less distinct than the well-delineated nodules seen in this patient.9 Finally, the patient is a nonsmoker, which makes respiratory bron- chiolitis with interstitial lung disease unlikely.\nDiffuse Idiopathic Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Cell Hyperplasia\nOn the basis of all the information available at this point in the patient\u2019s presentation, I can adjust the problem representation to an older, nonsmoking woman with dyspnea and a history of wheezing, along with an obstructive or a mixed obstructive\u2013restrictive pattern on pulmo- nary-function tests and air trapping and multi-ple small lung nodules on imaging. These find- ings are compatible with a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyper- plasia (DIPNECH). This rare entity is character- ized by diffuse hyperplasia of bronchiolar and bronchial pulmonary neuroendocrine cells, which appear as small nodular densities, or \u201ctumor- lets.\u201d The entity is associated with peribronchio- lar fibrosis that leads to a constrictive oblitera- tive bronchiolitis.9-11 To establish this diagnosis, I would recommend performing a lung biopsy.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Yolonda L. Colson: This patient\u2019s pulmonary nodules were small and round, with the largest nodule, measuring 6 mm in diameter, located in the right upper lobe near an incomplete fissure. Progressive symptoms and a dominant nodule warranted a tissue biopsy. Given this patient\u2019s pulmonary dysfunction, a limited wedge resec- tion was performed to spare lung parenchyma.\nBefore the patient underwent wedge resection of the 6-mm nodule in the right upper lobe, she was referred for placement of fiducial markers to aid in localization of the nodule during the surgical procedure. CT guidance was used to identify the nodule and incrementally navigate a coaxial needle through the chest wall and into the right lung, to the area adjacent to the nodule. Two gold fiducial markers were deployed through the lumen of the coaxial needle. The needle was removed, and the patient was placed in a depen- dent position. Chest radiography confirmed place- ment of two radiopaque markers in the right midlung and showed no evidence of complica- tions, such as pneumothorax. The patient was transferred to the operating room, where the markers were identified by means of fluoroscopy and excised along with the adjacent nodule. Im- ages obtained during the procedure are shown in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Imaging Studies Obtained for Wedge Resection of a Nodule in the Right Upper Lobe.\nAn axial CT scan obtained for localization (Panel A) shows a 6\u2011mm nodule in the right upper lobe (arrow). Axial CT scans obtained for guidance (Panels B, C, and D) show incremental advancement of a 19\u2011gauge coaxial needle through the subcutaneous tissues (Panel B), positioning of the tip of the coaxial needle adjacent to the nodule (Panel C), and placement of radiopaque gold fiducial markers adjacent to the nodule through the lumen of the coaxial needle, with subsequent removal of the needle (Panel D). A follow\u2011up chest radiograph (Panel E) confirms placement of the two markers in the right midlung (arrow) and shows no evidence of complications, such as pneumothorax. A radio\u2011 graph of the resected surgical specimen (Panel F) confirms removal of the two markers (arrows).\n\nFigure 3. Surgical Wedge Resection Specimen.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining shows multiple typical carcinoid tumors (Panel A), including a tumor immediately adjacent to the fiducial markers, as well as multiple carcinoid tumorlets (Panel B, arrows). The carcinoid tumors and tumorlets show admixed fibrosis. Airway\u2011centered fibrosis and chronic inflammation are also present, with regions of airway narrowing alternating with airway dilatation (Panel C). The lung parenchyma shows mild interstitial fibrosis (Panel D, arrows). Multiple foci of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia are present within bronchiolar walls, underlying the respiratory epithelium (Panel E, arrows). On immunohistochemical staining, the foci are positive for synaptophysin (Panel F) and chromogranin A (not shown). In the appropriate clinical context, this combination of histologic features is consistent with diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia.\n",
