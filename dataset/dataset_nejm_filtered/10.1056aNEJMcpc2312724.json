    "Primary Symptom": "A 36-Year-Old Man with Fevers",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Ethan Borre (Medicine): A 36-year-old man was evaluated in the infectious dis- eases clinic of this hospital because of fevers.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 18 days before the current presentation, when he began to have a sensation of swelling in his throat. Three days later, the temporal temperature measured at home was 38.4\u00b0C. A home test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen was negative. The patient was evaluated in a local urgent care clinic, where he was told that there were white spots on his tonsils. Treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was started for a presumptive diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. A throat culture was reportedly negative, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was continued. During the next 4 days, fevers persisted. A repeat home test for SARS-CoV-2 antigen was negative. Eleven days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician.\nIn addition to fevers, the patient reported headaches. Two weeks before the onset of symptoms, he had traveled with his wife to the southwestern United States for 1 week. During the trip, his wife had begun to have fever and sore throat; her symptoms had resolved after several days, and she did not seek medical evaluation. The patient reported that he did not have throat pain, but rather that the lower part of his neck felt swollen and that moving his neck caused discomfort. He had no dysphagia, odynophagia, rhinorrhea, or rash. His medical history included seasonal allergies.\nTwo years earlier, a routine screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had been negative. In addition to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, medications included ibuprofen as needed for headaches and acetaminophen as needed for fevers. The patient had no known drug allergies. He lived in Massachusetts and worked in an office setting. He had moved to the United States from Asia 7 years before the current presentation. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He occasionally smoked tobacco. His father had hypertension, and his paternal grandmother had cancer of unclear primary origin.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 127/69 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. The tonsils appeared normal, without exu- dates or enlargement. There was mild tenderness on palpation over the anterior portion of the neck that was thought to correspond to enlarged lymph nodes in the anterior cervical region. The remain- der of the examination was normal.\nA complete blood count with differential count and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. The blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was 65.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) antibodies was negative. Urinalysis was normal. A specimen of blood was obtained for culture. The results of chest radiography were normal. A diagnosis of viral pharyngitis was considered, but treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid for possible streptococcal pharyngitis was continued.\nDuring the next 6 days, daily fevers and headaches continued, and fatigue developed. The pa- tient reported his symptoms during a telephone call with his primary care physician. Blood cul- tures that had been obtained during the previous evaluation were without growth, and additional testing was performed. The blood level of CRP was 138.9 mg per liter, and the erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate (ESR) was 81 mm per hour (refer- ence range, 0 to 14). A test for Lyme disease was nonreactive. The result of an interferon-\u03b3 release assay to detect previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis was invalid because of a test control failure. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Shambo Guha Roy: Computed tomography\n(CT) of the neck (Fig. 1), chest, and abdomen was performed after the administration of intra- venous contrast material. A calcified lung nod- ule that was observed in the left lower lobe was consistent with previous granulomatous disease, and mild degenerative changes were noted in the thoracic spine. Evaluation of the thyroid gland was suboptimal owing to a streak artifact from the arms; however, a possible hypoattenuating nodule was observed in the right lobe.\nDr. Borre: During the next 4 days, fevers con- tinued, and the patient was referred to the infec- tious diseases clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the infectious diseases clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient reported that fevers were most prominent in the evening; the highest recorded temperature was 39.5\u00b0C. He had had two episodes of chills associated with fever, as well as occasional night sweats. He had no pets or animal exposures. He did not consume unpasteurized cheeses or uncooked meats. He was sexually active with his wife. A dental extrac- tion had been performed 2 months before the onset of fevers. He had no known exposures to persons with tuberculosis.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood  pressure  144/98  mm  Hg,  the  pulse  130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was noted to cough occasionally during the exami- nation but was breathing comfortably with nor- mal lung sounds. The oropharynx appeared normal, without tonsillar exudates. There was no supraclavicular, submandibular, cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Firm, nontender thyroid tissue was palpable in the anterior portion of the neck. No rashes or skin lesions were present, including on the palms or soles. The heart was tachycardic with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. There was no hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Eric A. Meyerowitz: This 36-year-old man pre- sented with subacute fevers, along with 18 days of associated symptoms, including throat discomfort, headaches, and fatigue. He had an appropriately extensive but unrevealing workup. Given that this patient\u2019s illness was characterized by fevers despite the administration of amoxicillin\u2013 clavulanic acid, I will first focus on some common noninfectious causes of fever and will then con- sider infectious and infection-associated causes using a systematic approach in the context of this host, his exposures, the time course of his illness, and the clinical syndrome.\n\nNoninfectious Causes\nMedication-induced fever is common but is un- likely in the case of this patient, since his fevers predated the administration of any medications. The patient reported occasional night sweats, but he had no weight loss and no other risk fac- tors that would suggest that the fevers were due to an underlying cancer. He had no other signs or symptoms that were consistent with rheuma- tologic disease, which makes an autoimmune process unlikely.\n\nHost Immune Status\nThe clinical presentation and risk of various infections depend on the nature of the host\u2019s immune status. Immunocompetent adults are likely to have typical presentations of common or unusual infections, whereas immunocompro- mised persons may have typical or atypical pre- sentations of common or unusual infections.\nDefining specific immune defects can narrow a differential diagnosis involving infection. For in- stance, diabetes confers a risk of invasive group B streptococcal infections, and eczema can confer a predisposition to severe manifestations of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and mpox. Certain intrinsic or acquired immunodeficiencies (such as HIV infection, exposure to certain medications, or previous organ transplantation) may be associ- ated with a wide range of infections, including opportunistic infections. This patient had a nega- tive routine screening test for HIV approximately 2 years before the current presentation, which makes severe immunodeficiency from long- standing, untreated HIV infection unlikely. Al- though severe CD4+ T-cell depletion can occur during acute HIV infection and is occasionally as- sociated with opportunistic infections, this patient had no identified risk factors for a new HIV infec- tion. Therefore, for the purpose of narrowing the list of possible diagnoses, I will presume that this patient is immunocompetent.\nExposure to Infection\nExposure to infection is important to consider but only in the context of a consistent clinical syndrome. For instance, this patient had re- cently traveled to the southwestern United States, where coccidioidomycosis is an important con- sideration. However, most persons with primary coccidioidomycosis remain asymptomatic. Ap- proximately one third of persons with coccidioido- mycosis have valley fever (an acute fungal pneumo- nia)1; however, this patient had no cough and no opacities on chest imaging, which makes primary coccidioidomycosis unlikely to explain his fevers.\nThe subacute onset, time course, and stability\nof the illness should also be considered. This patient had no signs of organ dysfunction, and his condition remained hemodynamically stable throughout the course of his illness. These fea- tures rule out rapidly progressive processes such as septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein.2\n\nDefining the Clinical Syndrome\nThe patient described his first symptom as a sensation of throat swelling. A few days later, an urgent care provider reported \u201cwhite spots\u201d on his tonsils, which suggested a possible clinical syndrome of exudative pharyngitis and led to a presumed diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngi- tis. Tonsillar exudates are nonspecific and may be associated with both bacterial and viral pro- cesses.3 Posterior oropharyngeal or tonsillar vesicles resulting from certain viral infections, such as HSV infection, could also appear as white spots.4 Exudative pharyngitis typically manifests with pain during swallowing and ten- derness on palpation of enlarged lymph nodes.5,6 When this patient was evaluated by his primary care physician, he clarified that he was having a sensation of swelling in the lower portion of his neck rather than a sore throat or pain or diffi- culty with swallowing, and no tonsillar exudates were seen. The primary care physician noted anterior neck tenderness that was possibly due to enlarged anterior cervical lymph nodes; how- ever, a CT image obtained a few days later did not show lymphadenopathy in the neck.\nEleven days later, during the current evaluation in the infectious diseases clinic, the heart rate was 130 beats per minute, there was no fever, and palpable thyroid tissue was noted in the an- terior portion of the neck. Although the thyroid tissue was nontender on palpation in the clinic, it is likely that the anterior neck tenderness previ- ously attributed to lymphadenopathy was pain on palpation of thyroid tissue. Taken together, the patient\u2019s fevers, anterior neck swelling and ten- derness over the thyroid gland, elevated levels of markers of inflammation, and sinus tachy- cardia could be indicative of hyperthyroidism. Although the patient was initially treated for exudative pharyngitis, the clinical syndrome is most consistent with subacute thyroiditis.\n\nSubacute Thyroiditis\nWhat could cause subacute thyroiditis in this patient? Subacute thyroiditis is associated with numerous preceding viral triggers, although the exact trigger is often unknown.7\n\nVaccine-Preventable Viruses\nSeveral vaccine-preventable viral infections are associated with subacute thyroiditis, including measles, mumps, and rubella. Although this patient may have come from an undervaccinated region, the measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella vaccine was required by the Department of Health and Hu- man Services at the time of the patient\u2019s immi- gration.8 No preceding clinical syndrome consis- tent with acute infection from these viruses was reported, such as a viral exanthem, conjunctival changes, or pain or swelling of the parotid gland or testicles.9,10\n\nViruses Associated with Exposure to Children Exposure to children in congregate settings, such as day care centers or schools, is a risk fac- tor for exposure to viruses associated with sub- acute thyroiditis, including echovirus, parvovi- rus B19, coxsackievirus, and varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV). This patient had no reported high- risk exposure and no rashes, consistent sores, or arthralgias.11,12 He may have had primary VZV infection as a child and was unlikely to have had VZV vaccination during childhood on the basis of his age.13 Without previous infection, he would be susceptible to primary VZV infection14; how- ever, no typical symptoms were described.\n\nViruses Associated with Sexual and Other Close Intimate Contact\nA third group of viruses that are associated with the development of subacute thyroiditis are ac- quired through sexual and other close intimate contact. These include cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV types 1 and 2, EBV, and HIV. Typically, only recently acquired infections trigger subacute thyroiditis. It is important to ask about extra- marital partners and to perform appropriate testing. A new HSV type 2 infection would not necessarily result from an additional sexual partner, since the baseline incidence of HSV type 2 transmission among serodiscordant couples is approximately 5% per year.15,16 However, this patient had no symptoms consistent with oral or genital HSV infection.\nEBV, CMV, and HIV can all cause a mononucleosis syndrome with fever. However, pharyngi- tis, lymphadenopathy, and atypical lymphocyto- sis would also be expected.17 This patient\u2019s EBV serologic tests rule out acute or previous EBV infection; after nearly 3 weeks of symptoms, the EBV-specific antibodies would be detectable in a person with acute EBV infection.18 A negative test for HIV antigen and antibody would rule out acute HIV infection at this point in the patient\u2019s course of illness.19\nOne report of subacute thyroiditis that oc- curred after mpox virus infection described a 51-year-old man with well-controlled HIV infec- tion who began to have neck discomfort, fatigue, weight loss, elevated CRP levels, and hyperthy- roidism 3 weeks after infection.20 Even though mpox can be asymptomatic, it seems highly un- likely in this case, in the absence of typical symp- toms, rash, or additional sexual partners.\n\nRespiratory Viruses\nInfection with respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, can also cause subacute thyroiditis. This patient had no history of an influenza-like illness; however, approximately 30% of cases of influenza are asymptomatic.21 Since the pre- sumed preceding infection probably occurred several weeks before the current presentation, it may not be possible to confirm a remote influenza virus infection. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports influen- za case counts at all times; such information should be checked against the patient\u2019s time course of illness.22\nSeveral case reports and series describe the development of subacute thyroiditis after SARS- CoV-2 infection.23 This patient\u2019s wife had had a transient febrile illness with a sore throat \u2014 very common symptoms associated with multiple sub- lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant24 \u2014 during their trip to the southwestern United States, approximately 2 weeks before the onset of swelling and tenderness over the pa- tient\u2019s thyroid gland. The patient did not have similar symptoms at that time; however, ap- proximately 20 to 30% of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic.25\nThe patient\u2019s two negative SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests are not surprising, since the typical onset of subacute thyroiditis is at least 2 to 4 weeks after the inciting infection. Rapid antigen tests are positive when viral loads are highest, and less than 1% of tests are positive more than 10 days after infection.26,27 The vast majority of nucleic acid tests in immunocompetent young adults are negative 15 days after infection, and this pa- tient\u2019s test would probably have been negative by the time of the current presentation.28\nI suspect that this patient had subacute thyroiditis, and the diagnostic test was measure- ment of the thyrotropin level. Serologic testing might confirm a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is not always reliable. Among unvaccinated persons with a new SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a polymerase-chain-reaction test, more than 90% will subsequently have antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein.29 By contrast, among previously vaccinated persons, only approximately 40% may subsequently have antinucleocapsid antibodies. Therefore, if this patient had been previously vaccinated, a negative test for antinu- cleocapsid antibodies would not rule out a recent infection. Antinucleocapsid antibody levels rise for approximately 100 days and then decline, with the incidence of seroreversion expected to be roughly 20% after 2 years.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Grace K. Mahowald: At this hospital, the algo- rithm for a thyroid panel starts with evaluation of the thyrotropin level. If the thyrotropin level is less than 0.40 \u03bcIU per milliliter, then the levels of free thyroxine and total triiodothyro- nine are measured. This patient\u2019s thyrotropin level was low (<0.01 \u03bcIU per milliliter; reference range, 0.40 to 5.99). The free thyroxine level was high (3.7 ng per deciliter [48 pmol per liter]; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]), as was the total triiodothyro- nine level (281 ng per deciliter [4.3 nmol per li- ter]; reference range, 60 to 181 ng per deciliter [0.9 to 2.8 nmol per liter]).\nAntithyroid antibody tests were also performed.\nThyroperoxidase antibodies can be present in patients with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis or Graves\u2019 disease. The thyrotropin-receptor antibody test as- sesses whether antibodies that bind to the thyro- tropin receptor are present (thyroid-stimulating antibodies as well as thyroid-blocking antibod- ies). Both the thyroperoxidase antibody test and the thyrotropin-receptor antibody test were negative.\nThe thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test is a bioassay that is performed with cells that have been transfected with the human thy- rotropin receptor and a luciferase expression con- struct under the control of a cyclic adenosine monophosphate promoter. The TSI index is calculated by comparing the number of light units produced in the cell lysate on exposure to a pa- tient\u2019s serum with that produced on exposure to a control serum. This patient\u2019s TSI index was less than 1.0 (negative; reference value, \u22641.3).\nOverall, this patient\u2019s laboratory findings were consistent with hyperthyroidism. No anti- thyroid antibodies were detected.\n\n",
