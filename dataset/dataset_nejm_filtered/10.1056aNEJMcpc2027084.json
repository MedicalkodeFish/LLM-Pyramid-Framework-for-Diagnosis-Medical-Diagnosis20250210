    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Natasha Merali (Medicine): A 76-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of lethargy and altered mental status.\nThe patient had been well until 2 months before this evaluation, when she was admitted to another hospital for community-acquired pneumonia. Empirical treat- ment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin was administered, and her condition partially improved.\nTwo weeks later, the patient presented to the other hospital with recurrent dyspnea and lethargy. A partly loculated right pleural effusion was identified. Empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was adminis- tered intravenously. Thoracostomy (placement of a chest tube for drainage) was performed, and pleural f luid analysis revealed an exudative pleural effusion; Gram\u2019s staining showed no neutrophils or microorganisms, culture showed no growth, and cytologic testing showed no malignant cells. After a 1-week admis- sion, the dyspnea abated, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy.\nTwo weeks before this evaluation, generalized weakness and lethargy devel- oped, along with new diffuse headache. The patient\u2019s family thought that she appeared somnolent and \u201cclumsy\u201d while walking. Four days later, her family took her to the other hospital for evaluation. A review of systems was notable for dys- pnea, leg edema, and hematochezia and no fever, chills, chest pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, or melena. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute,  the  blood  pressure  176/101  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  20  breaths  per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while she was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented but appeared to be confused when recalling recent events. She had jugular venous distention, diffuse lung rales, and 2+ symmetric pitting edema of the lower legs up to the knees. The blood urea nitrogen level was 83 mg per deciliter (29.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 20 mg per deciliter [2.1 to\n7.1 mmol per liter]), the creatinine level 4.9 mg per deciliter (433 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.4 to 1.1 mg per deciliter [35 to 97 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the hematocrit 26% (reference range, 34 to 45). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Chest radiography revealed a small right pleural effusion and moder- ate interstitial pulmonary edema. Computed to- mography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, revealed a chronic subcortical infarct of the right frontal lobe, as well as diffuse involutional changes and nonspecific white-matter hypoden- sities.\nDr. Merali: Oral labetalol, clonidine, and hydra- lazine and intravenous furosemide were administered to treat possible hypertensive emergency. During the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s headache and anemia worsened and dizziness developed. On the seventh hospital day, there was an acute episode of nonbloody emesis, followed by a gen- eralized tonic\u2013clonic seizure lasting 1 minute. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nDr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous con- trast material, revealed findings similar to those of the previous study. Magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1), performed with- out the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed two foci of restricted diffu- sion in the right frontal lobe and the left cerebel- lar hemisphere, each measuring 1 cm in diam- eter, with surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion re- covery (FLAIR) images. In addition, there was diffuse ventricular enlargement, with surround- ing smooth hyperintensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR images; this finding is suggestive of com- municating hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). T2-weighted and FLAIR images also showed multiple foci of hyperintensity scattered throughout the deep white matter.\nDr. Merali: Video electroencephalography re-\nvealed epileptiform discharges predominantly in the frontal lobe, with generalized slowing. Levetiracetam, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were administered; intermittent hemodialysis was initiated.\nDuring the next 3 days, the patient began to have a right gaze preference, left hemineglect, and aphasia. The temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C, and chills developed. Blood specimens were ob- tained for microbiologic culture. Lumbar punc- ture was deferred, pending additional imaging studies to rule out a space-occupying lesion. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftazi- dime, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. At the request of her family, the patient was transferred to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s family. Two years earlier, the patient had received a diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma, which was treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Therapy was discontinued after three of six cycles be- cause of ileus, renal injury, and neutropenic fever. Robotic subtotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gas- tric bypass were then performed; histologic ex- amination of the resected tissue revealed a nearly complete response of the adenocarcinoma. Five months before the current evaluation, CT with  18F-f luorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography performed at the other hospital revealed FDG avidity in nonenlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, retroperito- neum, porta hepatis, and right cervical region. Biopsy was offered, but the patient chose to undergo active surveillance. Additional medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and stage 5 chronic kidney disease. Medications in- cluded torsemide, amlodipine, clonidine, hydrala- zine, hydrochlorothiazide, labetalol, rosuvastatin, insulin, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, mirtazap- ine, and oxycodone. There were no known drug allergies.\nFour decades before the current admission,\nthe patient had immigrated to the United States from an island off the west coast of Africa. She was widowed, had four children, and lived with a pet parrot in an urban area of New England. Two months before hospitalization, she had been independent in activities of daily living and had received minimal assistance, such as with buy- ing groceries, from family members. The patient had traveled to her country of origin 8 years earlier and to South America and the Caribbean in the past year. She had had no sexual partners in the past three decades. She did not drink al- cohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her sister had received a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer at 60 years of age; there was no family history of rheumatologic, neurologic, cardiovas- cular, or renal disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C,\nthe heart rate 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/92 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.8. The patient was somnolent and variably oriented to self but not to situation, location, or time. She intermittently opened her eyes spontaneously but did not follow com- mands or reliably withdraw in response to noxious stimuli. Her face and pupils appeared symmet- ric; a right gaze preference and left hemineglect were present. There was no evidence of jugular venous distention, rales, or edema, and the ab- dominal examination was normal.\nTesting  for human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibodies and p24 an-tigen was nonreactive. A test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive, and a rapid plasma re- agin test was negative. Other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Gonzalez: Repeat CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous con- trast material, revealed foci of hypoattenuation in the left superior cerebellar hemisphere and the right frontal lobe that corresponded to the foci of restricted diffusion on MRI observed at the other hospital.\nDr. Merali: Empirical treatment with vancomy- cin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, metronidazole, and acyclovir was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, a lumbar puncture was per- formed. The opening pressure was 15 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glu- cose level of 18 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 173 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 236 nucleated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5),  of which 69%  were\nneutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, and 12% mono-cytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed abun- dant neutrophils and mononuclear cells; no organisms were identified. Transthoracic echo- cardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypo- kinesis and aortic sclerosis.\nOn the fourth hospital day, new right esopho- ria developed and the patient was less respon- sive. The trachea was intubated and mechanical ventilation was initiated for airway protection.\nDr. Gonzalez: Repeat MRI of the head (Fig. 2), performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the previously observed lesions in the right frontal lobe and left cerebellum. There were ad- ditional foci of reduced diffusivity, with corre- sponding hyperintense signal abnormalities on T2-weighted and FLAIR images, involving both cerebral hemispheres, deep gray matter, the brain stem, and the cerebellum. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal narrowing of branches of the bilateral middle and posterior cerebral arter- ies. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, per- formed without the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no other abnormalities.\nDr. Merali: Empirical treatment with methyl- prednisolone was started. The next day, repeat lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 16 cm of water. The CSF was slightly yellow, with a glucose level of 179 mg per deciliter (9.9 mmol per liter) and a protein level of 181 mg per deciliter. There were 286 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 83% were neutrophils, 9% lymphocytes, and 8% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed abundant neutrophils and moderate mononucle- ar cells; there were no organisms.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lisa M. Bebell: This patient had a complex mul- tiorgan syndrome that developed over a 2-month period, with a stuttering course that spanned multiple presentations. The initial presentation with presumed community-acquired pneumonia was followed by the development of a loculated pleural effusion and, eventually, profound neu- rologic manifestations. With each evaluation, new clinical signs and symptoms were identified and additional information was obtained. I will construct a differential diagnosis using a step- by-step approach, incorporating the findings from each successive presentation, to arrive at the most likely diagnosis in this case.\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia and Pleural Effusion (First and Second Presentations)\nAlthough this patient initially received a diagno- sis of community-acquired pneumonia, she did not fully recover despite appropriate empirical treatment with antibiotic therapy. Two weeks later, she presented with dyspnea, lethargy, and a loculated, exudative, culture-negative, unilat- eral pleural effusion. At this point, possible di- agnoses included infectious and inflammatory pneumonia syndromes and cancer. Fever and parenchymal infiltrates were not noted; their absence would be unusual in the context of community-acquired pneumonia\u2013associated em- pyema. Exacerbation of heart failure seemed unlikely because the effusion was loculated and exudative. An autoimmune disease such as sar- coidosis was possible, although patients with sarcoidosis rarely present with loculated effu- sions.1-3 Gram\u2019s staining and culture of the pleu- ral fluid were negative. It is unclear whether fungal and mycobacterial cultures of the pleural fluid and culture of sputum were performed. Although community-acquired pneumonia was a potential diagnosis on the first presentation, it would not adequately explain her second presen- tation, with dyspnea and pleural effusion. De- spite normothermia and the absence of focal pulmonary infiltrates, the patient was treated empirically for health care\u2013associated pneumo- nia with concomitant vancomycin and piperacil- lin\u2013tazobactam, agents that increase the risk of acute kidney injury.4 Although a cytologic test of the pleural fluid was negative for malignant cells, this test has a sensitivity of only approximately 60% and cannot be used to rule out cancer.5\n\nCentral Nervous System Symptoms (Third Presentation)\nDespite empirical treatment for health care\u2013 associated pneumonia, the patient\u2019s condition worsened. Altered mental status and signs and symptoms of heart failure developed, and she was treated for hypertensive emergency. Respira- tory symptoms became less prominent, and cen- tral nervous system (CNS) symptoms emerged. Of note, she remained afebrile but had a low hematocrit and platelet count. The diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident must be considered, although headache is uncommon in the context of cerebrovascular accident without subarach- noid hemorrhage.6 Could the patient\u2019s clumsi- ness be due to neuraxial involvement, raising the possibility of simultaneous infection of the brain and the lungs?\nBecause CNS  symptoms developed, disease\nprocesses with direct CNS effects (invasion) and processes with indirect CNS effects (caused by cytokines and chemokines) should be consid- ered. Could this patient have a primary systemic process with secondary CNS effects suggestive of a toxic or metabolic disturbance? Alterna- tively, could her CNS involvement represent pro- gression of a primary process that began in the lung? Finally, could her illness be explained by a primary CNS process with secondary or concur- rent systemic manifestations? On the basis of the information that we have at this point in her disease course, community-acquired pneumonia does not account for all the clinical features described. On the differential diagnosis, I would include diagnoses with secondary CNS effects, namely toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, throm- botic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic\u2013 uremic  syndrome,  hypertensive  emergency, and\n \ncerebrovascular accident. In addition, concomi- tant systemic and CNS infection seems plausi- ble, as does autoimmune disease with CNS in- volvement.\n\nImaging Studies\nResults of MRI of the head help to narrow the differential diagnosis in this case. The cerebellar lesion may explain the patient\u2019s clumsiness, which is probably due to ataxia. The presence of findings consistent with communicating hydro- cephalus suggests damage to the arachnoid granulations that is limiting CSF resorption; such damage can occur with meningitis. After these findings were obtained, a seizure and critical illness developed, prompting consider- ation of CNS-tropic infections, namely varicella zoster meningoencephalitis, tertiary syphilis, and CNS bacterial abscess. However, these infections would not explain the pulmonary process. Dis- seminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a possible diagnosis that could explain the unilat- eral loculated pleural effusion. Cancer metasta- sis to the brain should be considered, as should systemic autoimmune disease (specifically sar- coidosis, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s syndrome, and granulomato- sis with polyangiitis) with pulmonary and CNS involvement. Brain\u2013lung infections due to patho- gens such as nocardia, streptococci and other oral flora, staphylococci, intracellular bacteria, brucella, and fungi (especially coccidiodes and aspergillus) are possibilities, but I would rule out all processes that affect single organ systems, because they would not sufficiently explain this complex disease affecting multiple organ sys- tems. If we abandon the principle of Occam\u2019s razor, we could consider the possibility that multiple concomitant single-organ processes could have caused the constellation of signs and symptoms seen in this case.\nPatient History\nThe history of partially treated gastric adenocar- cinoma may be an important feature in this case. It seems unlikely that the patient\u2019s cancer was cured, despite partial gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Furthermore, diabetes mellitus and stage 5 chronic kidney disease are associated with immune dysfunction, increasing the risk of infection and cancer metastasis.7 The FDG-avid nonenlarged lymph nodes seen 5 months before the current evaluation could be due to progressive metastatic cancer or a smoldering infectious or inflammatory process. HIV and rapid plasma reagin tests were negative, but a test for antitreponemal antibodies was positive. This pattern is consistent with current or previ- ous syphilis (Treponema pallidum infection) or cross-reactivity with other antitreponemal anti- bodies. Finally, the patient\u2019s pet parrot raises concerns about psittacosis, a pneumonia caused by the common avian intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia psittaci. C. psittaci has been reported to cause meningoencephalitis but not brain lesions or cerebrovascular accident.8 The patient\u2019s extensive travel history leads me to re- consider disseminated endemic mycoses, espe- cially coccidioidomycosis, which can cause CNS vasculitis. However, it is not clear that she had traveled to the Southwest region of the United States, where Coccidioides immitis is endemic. Dis- seminated blastomycosis and histoplasmosis in- frequently cause cerebrovascular accident.\n\nCSF Analysis and Magnetic Resonance Angiography\nResults from the first lumbar puncture were quite revealing. CSF analysis showed moderate neutrophil-predominant CSF pleocytosis, hypo- glycorrhachia, and a high protein level, findings that could reflect partially treated bacterial men- ingitis. However, this far into the clinical illness, the CSF nucleated-cell count would be too low and the protein level too high for a diagnosis of partially treated bacterial meningitis. Neutrophil predominance and a low glucose level would be unusual for viral meningitis but consistent with fungal meningitis due to C. immitis or aspergillus and possibly consistent with syphilitic menin- gitis. Although CSF pleocytosis with monocyte predominance is usually present in patients with tuberculous meningitis, neutrophil predominance can occur early in the disease course. Xantho- chromia, a high protein level, and hypoglycor- rhachia support the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, although the hypoglycorrhachia would be an extreme finding for this diagnosis.\nThe findings on magnetic resonance angiog-\nraphy are critically important in refining the differential diagnosis in this case. There was multifocal narrowing of medium and large CNS vessels, a finding indicative of CNS vasculitis.\n \n\nInfectious Causes of Cerebrovascular Disease\nThe findings of moderate CSF pleocytosis, mul- tiple evolving parenchymal brain lesions with communicating hydrocephalus, and CNS vascu- litis are highly consistent with cerebrovascular disease caused by CNS infection (Table 2).9 In patients with CNS infection, cerebrovascular disease results from vasculitis at the brain base, immune-mediated parainfectious processes, and hypercoagulability with endothelial dysfunction. These processes converge to cause cerebral in- farction that is indistinguishable from common ischemic cerebrovascular accident, so a high in- dex of suspicion is required to correctly diag- nose and appropriately treat CNS infection. The presence of headache may be a clue, because headache does not commonly occur with nonin- flammatory ischemic cerebrovascular accident.6 Nearly all causes of meningitis can result in vasculitis and cerebrovascular accident through encroachment of subarachnoid inflammatory ex- udate into large vessels at the brain base; inva- sion of vessel walls by inflammatory cells, which causes intimal thickening, stenosis, dilatation, and edema; vasospasm; and hypercoagulability, which causes diffuse intravascular thrombi. Un- fortunately, there are no CSF findings specific for infection-associated CNS vasculitis, which usually portends a poor prognosis. Some CNS vasculitides may abate with the administration of glucocorticoids,9 but the use of such agents is controversial, because glucocorticoids can reduce the permeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier and diminish the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.10 On the basis of the finding of CNS vasculitis, only four likely diagnoses remain on the differ- ential diagnosis. Disseminated endemic fungal disease is possible, but the timeline of the ill- ness is protracted and the travel history is not a good fit for this diagnosis. Metastatic cancer must be considered, although metastasis of gas- tric cancer to the CNS is rare11 and there is no evidence of leptomeningeal disease that could explain the meningitis. Systemic autoimmune diseases such as sarcoidosis,12,13 Beh\u00e7et\u2019s syn- drome, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis are still considerations in this case, but parenchy- mal brain lesions are not consistent with these diagnoses.14,15\nDisseminated tuberculosis with meningitis and CNS vasculitis is the diagnosis that fits best with this patient\u2019s subacute, stuttering disease course, which began with the detection of FDG- avid lymph nodes 5 months before the current evaluation and culminated in meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. In addition, the history of travel to areas in which tuberculosis is highly endemic and the laboratory and imaging fea- tures are suggestive of this diagnosis. The findings in this case that are most consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis with men- ingitis are CNS vasculitis, moderate CSF pleocy- tosis, the high CSF protein level, hypoglycorrha- chia, xanthochromia, hydrocephalus, the unilateral exudative pleural  effusion,  lymphadenitis, thrombocytopenia and anemia indicative of probable bone marrow involvement, the subacute course, and disease progression despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the patient was at a high risk for the development of active tu- berculosis because of the history of gastric re- section,16 diabetes,17 and chronic kidney disease.18 Although the Ghon complex was not noted on chest radiography, this sign is not always present in patients with tuberculosis. Of note, tubercu- losis often disseminates to distant sites during primary lung infection, becomes encapsulated in granulomas, and later ruptures into the sub- arachnoid space and other sterile sites.9\nDefinitive diagnosis of tuberculous meningi-\ntis is often challenging. The highest-yield diag- nostic approach is large-volume CSF sampling for an acid-fast bacilli smear and mycobacterial culture, although some molecular tests have high sensitivity and specificity.19 The tuberculin skin test and interferon-\u03b3 release assay are helpful in confirming the diagnosis when they are posi- tive, but negative tests cannot rule out active tuberculosis. A sputum sample should be ob- tained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, and specimens of lymph node or bone marrow tissue should be obtained for microbiologic studies when possible, given the low diagnostic yield of the CSF smear.\nIf the diagnosis in this patient is dissemi-\nnated tuberculosis with CNS vasculitis, then why did the illness develop now? Although we often think of tuberculosis as either latent or active, it can be simultaneously latent at some anatomical sites and active at others. Furthermore, tubercu- losis results in a continuous spectrum of meta- bolic bacterial activity and antagonistic immune responses.20,21 The patient could have primary disseminated tuberculosis, but she is more likely to have reactivation of largely latent dissemi- nated disease in the pleura and CNS as a result of progressive chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, age, and reduced gastric acidity due to gastrectomy.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Melis N. Anahtar: The diagnostic test in this case was an auramine O fluorescent stain of an acid-fast bacilli smear of a concentrated CSF specimen. Staining of a smear of the first CSF specimen (obtained on the second hospital day) was negative, but staining of a smear of the second CSF specimen (obtained on the fifth hospital day) was positive, with few acid-fast bacilli seen (Fig. 3A). Then, a traditional Ziehl\u2013 Neelsen stain of the second CSF specimen was performed, and acid-fast bacilli were seen, indi- vidually and in clusters (Fig. 3B). The bacilli were approximately 2 to 4 \u03bcm long and slightly bent; these morphologic features are consistent with mycobacterium species. Subsequently, three spu- tum specimens were obtained, and smears and cultures of these specimens were negative.\nLiquid culture of the first and second CSF\nspecimens was positive after 9 and 8 days of incubation, respectively. These results show the high sensitivity of mycobacterial culture, which has a lower limit of detection of approximately 10 to 100 acid-fast bacilli per milliliter of speci- men, as compared with a lower limit of ap- proximately 10,000 on microscopic examination of a smear.22,23 A Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain of the liquid broth confirmed the presence of acid-fast bacilli and showed serpentine cords (Fig. 3C), which are due to the expression of a surface glyco- protein called cord factor and are suggestive of\nM.\ttuberculosis.24 A fluorescent nucleic acid hybridization probe of the liquid broth was posi- tive for M. tuberculosis complex. Subculture of the liquid broth on a Middlebrook 7H10 agar plate was performed and, several weeks later, showed a pure M. tuberculosis culture with classic mor- phologic features, including dry white colonies with wrinkling at the colony interfaces (Fig. 3D).\nMALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of f light) mass spectrometry confirmed the identification of M. tuberculosis. Conventional antimicrobial susceptibility  testing with the use of the agar proportion method revealed susceptibility to first-line and second-line tuberculosis therapies.\n\nFigure 3.
