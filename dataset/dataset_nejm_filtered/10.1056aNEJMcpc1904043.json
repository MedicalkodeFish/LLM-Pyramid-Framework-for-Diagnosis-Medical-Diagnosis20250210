    "Primary Symptom": "A 27-Year-Old Woman with Opioid Use Disorder and Suicidal Ideation",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Andrew Cruz (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of a suicide attempt.\nApproximately 3 months before admission, the patient became homeless and was staying intermittently with friends. Two months before admission, she began to ingest clonazepam daily, and 3 weeks before admission, she began to use intra- nasal heroin daily. She had depression and anxiety, and 2 days before admission, she expressed that she felt \u201ctired of living this life\u201d and wanted \u201cto end it all.\u201d\nOn the evening of presentation, the patient reportedly smashed her cell phone on the ground and ate the glass shards as a suicide attempt. Nausea and diffuse abdominal discomfort developed, and she reportedly had an episode vomiting, with the vomit containing 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of blood. Three hours after the ingestion, she presented to the emergency department of this hospital with throat, chest, and abdominal pain. She reported that she had \u201cregret\u201d about the ingestion and wanted \u201chelp\u201d with her substance use and suicidality.\nThe patient reported past sexual trauma but did not provide details; she did not report any previous suicide attempts, homicidal ideation, or hallucinations. A limit- ed review of systems was notable for anorexia, diaphoresis, diarrhea, impaired sleep, fatigue, mood lability, nightmares, and flashbacks. Her psychiatric history included polysubstance use disorder (with the use of intravenous heroin, fentanyl, benzodiazepines, and cocaine), cutting behavior during adolescence, and anxiety and depression. She had never undergone psychiatric treatment or hospitalization. Her medical history included hepatitis C virus infection, obesity, genital herpes simplex virus infection, and a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix; in addition, a motor vehicle collision had led to open reduction and internal fixation involving the left arm. She took no medications and had no known ad- verse reactions to medications. She worked in a local store and had a small child. She had smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years and was a current smoker. She drank 1 pint of vodka daily and reported no history of withdrawals or blackouts. Multiple relatives, including both of her parents, had a history of substance use dis- order.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 70 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared disheveled, tearful, and anxious. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness on the right side on palpation. On examination by a psychiatrist, she had limited eye contact and mumbling speech, along with poor concentration, depressed mood with a con- gruent affect, and poor insight and judgment. The complete blood count and levels of electro- lytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, lactate, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin were normal; the aspartate aminotransferase level was 162 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), and the ala- nine aminotransferase level was 52 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Ethanol was not de- tected in the blood, and human chorionic gonado- tropin was not detected in the urine. A urine toxicology screen was positive for opioids and cocaine metabolites. The findings on an electro- cardiogram were normal and unchanged from a tracing obtained 10 years earlier.\nDr. Efren J. Flores: The results of radiography of the neck, chest, and abdomen were normal, without a visible radiopaque foreign body. Com- puted tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pel- vis, performed after the administration of intra- venous contrast material (Fig. 1), revealed gallbladder wall thickening and trace perihepatic fluid. These findings can be seen in patients with acute hepatitis. There was no evidence of pneumo- peritoneum or of a radiopaque foreign body.\nDr. Cruz: Intravenous normal saline, morphine sulfate, and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were admin- istered. The patient was evaluated by the surgery and psychiatry services. Because of concern about the patient\u2019s risk of self-harm, an order that authorized temporary involuntary hospital- ization was implemented.\nThe next evening, the patient reported that while she was trying to get out of a stretcher, she \u201cheard a pop\u201d in her right elbow, which was ac- companied by immediate pain without any numb- ness or tingling. On examination by an orthope- dic surgeon, the olecranon process appeared to protrude posteriorly and medially without ecchy- mosis. The patient was not able to move the arm at the elbow, although range of motion was intact at the shoulder and wrist.\nDr. Flores: A lateral image of the right elbow (Fig. 2A) showed posterior dislocation of the el- bow with impaction of the olecranon process of the ulna into the distal humerus outside the olecranon fossa. An anteroposterior image of the right elbow (Fig. 2B) confirmed dislocation of the elbow with malalignment of the ulnotroch- lear and radiocapitellar joints.\nDr. Cruz: After the administration of aceta- minophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and intrave- nous morphine, the elbow was manually reduced and a splint was applied. Additional radiograph- ic images were obtained.\nDr. Flores: Lateral and anteroposterior images of the right elbow obtained after closed reduc- tion and splinting (Fig. 2C and 2D) showed nor- mal alignment of the ulnotrochlear and radio- capitellar joints.\nDr. Cruz: During the next 18 hours, the patient remained under observation, with a plan for transfer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for ongoing care. One hour before transfer, the pa- tient went to the bathroom without her observer and then reported that she could not move her right arm.\nDr. Flores: A lateral image of the right elbow showed that the splint was in place and showed posterior dislocation of the elbow with impaction of the olecranon process of the ulna into the distal humerus outside the olecranon fossa. An anteroposterior image of the right elbow con- firmed dislocation of the elbow with predomi- nant involvement of the radiocapitellar joint. There was irregularity of the radial head and lateral humeral epicondyle that was consistent with a nondisplaced fracture.\nDr. Cruz: Intravenous morphine was adminis- tered. The elbow was again reduced, and a cir- cumferential fiberglass cast was placed.\nDr. Flores: A lateral image of the right elbow obtained after the second closed reduction and casting showed normal alignment and the pres- ence of a cast.\nDr. Cruz: The next afternoon, after the plan for transfer to a psychiatric hospital was shared with the patient, she was found in the bathroom with- out her observer, where she was banging her left arm against the wall. She reported pain, and oral oxycodone and intramuscular hydromorphone were administered.\nDr. Flores: A lateral image of the left elbow obtained hours after the second reduction and casting of the right elbow (Fig. 2E) showed pos- terior dislocation of the left elbow and a frag- ment from a displaced fracture of the trochlea. There were two screws in the lateral humeral epicondyle from previous open reduction and internal fixation.\nDr. Cruz: Intraarticular nerve block was per- formed. The left elbow was reduced, and a long- arm circumferential fiberglass cast was placed.\n\nFigure 1.

These findings can be seen in patients with acute hepatitis. There is no evidence of pneumoperitoneum or of a foreign body.\n\nFigure 2 (facing page).

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mladen Nisavic: This 27-year-old woman with active polysubstance use disorder (with the use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and opioids) presented to the hospital after a reported suicide attempt by means of foreign-body ingestion. During the initial safety evaluation and surgical stabilization, a history of polysubstance use, anxi- ety, depressed mood, and trauma was elicited; she reported no previous suicide attempts.\nThe patient\u2019s initial vital signs were normal, and she had no physical findings consistent with active alcohol withdrawal. The report of diarrhea, diaphoresis, and abdominal discomfort would arouse concern about early opioid withdrawal, given the recent use of opioids and reported his- tory of opioid use disorder. Drug screening was notable for the presence of opioids and cocaine. Alcohol and benzodiazepines were not detected, nor was the heroin-specific metabolite 6-mono- acetylmorphine.\nInitial plain radiography of the chest and abdomen and abdominal CT did not reveal any ingested foreign bodies. It is important to note that small pieces of metal, glass, and plastic (which are presumed components of most cell phones) may not be reliably detected on imaging studies. However, in this case, the complete ab- sence of imaging findings raises the question of whether the patient is being truthful about at- tempting suicide.1 It is also important to note that, despite the ultimate absence of trauma and of evidence of foreign-body ingestion, the pa- tient reported clinically significant pain and in- travenous opioids were administered.\nMy concern regarding this patient\u2019s  overall\nengagement and truthfulness with the team is further confirmed on review of her subsequent stay in the surgery unit. Over the course of 3 days, the patient had two episodes of seemingly spon- taneous dislocation of the right elbow before she was observed actively attempting to dislocate her left elbow. Despite the presence of an observer, details regarding the way in which the first two injuries occurred are scarce; in both cases, the patient reported afterward that the dislocation was spontaneous and claimed to have no insight into the event. Despite prompt orthopedic treat- ment, she reported clinically significant pain with each dislocation and intravenous opioids were administered. Furthermore, the second and third dislocations had a notable temporal correla- tion with the planned transfer to an inpatient psychiatric facility, with the injuries occurring mere hours before the transfer was meant to occur. In summary, a young woman with polysub- stance use disorder self-presented after a self- reported suicidal gesture, and ultimately, no objective evidence of foreign-body ingestion was discovered. During routine surgical observation for clearance before planned transfer to an inpa- tient psychiatric facility, the patient appears to have engaged in repeated acts of self-harm, and until she was discovered engaging in such an act, she described each new injury as unintentional. With each incident, she reported clinically sig- nificant pain and intravenous opioids were administered.\nWhich diagnosis or diagnoses may explain this patient\u2019s recurrent pattern of self-harm and limited engagement with the team? It is impor- tant to construct a broad differential diagnosis even if the diagnosis initially appears certain. Maintaining a broad differential diagnosis can help us to adequately confirm the major problem and to potentially identify less active or obvious contributors to the clinical situation. During psychiatric assessment, it is critical to consider each major component of the psychiatric review of symptoms and the way in which each compo- nent may apply to the case and help us to under- stand the patient\u2019s behavior and actions. Such an approach offers a thorough and methodical path toward establishing the pertinent diagnosis and identifying any additional problems.\nIn gaining an understanding of this patient\u2019s presentation, some of the major components of the history \u2014 such as depressed mood, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014 are notable. Despite her initial endorsement of mood, anxiety, and safety concerns, she quickly stopped report- ing these symptoms during her stay in the sur- gery unit. In addition, there are few findings that would allow us to ascribe the patient\u2019s be- havior to an episode associated with untreated major depressive disorder. An underlying thought disorder or acute mania may be considered, pri- marily given the bizarre nature of her recurrent injuries. However, neither of these diagnoses appears to be consistent with the remainder of the history. The patient did not have a history of clinically significant severe and persistent mental illness, and no cardinal symptoms of either acute mania or psychosis were described throughout her hospitalization. No negative symptoms of a major thought disorder were described, either.\nPersonality vulnerability or frank personality\ndisorders could also be considered, especially given the patient\u2019s history of trauma. However, we do not have the necessary information to support these diagnoses, and her brief hospital- ization offers insufficient exposure to allow us to make these diagnoses.\nMultiple substance use disorders were noted in this case, and I strongly suspect that substance use is playing a considerable role in this patient\u2019s presentation. Acute intoxication (e.g., with co- caine) may be associated with unusual behavior, but repeated use while under strict observation in the hospital would be unlikely. Withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines can be linked with delirium, but the patient\u2019s behavior appears to be deliberate, methodical, and devoid of acute confusion and of any other signs or symptoms of acute withdrawal from one of these agents, such as tremor or changes in vital signs. She reported recent opioid use, and her initial ex- amination was notable for some signs of early opioid withdrawal. Furthermore, she requested intravenous opioids at the time of the initial pre- sentation and with each episode of self-injurious behavior. Could opioid use disorder be the unify- ing diagnosis in this case?\nIn the presence of intentional and repetitive self-harm, a diagnosis in the category of somatic symptom and related disorders could also be explored. A deception syndrome (factitious dis- order or malingering) is a strong consideration, given the multiple inconsistencies in the avail- able information and ultimate evidence of de- liberate self-infliction of injuries. To rule out an occult medical cause, I performed a literature search for spontaneous and recurrent elbow dis- locations. The review offered limited data but provided reassurance that spontaneous elbow dislocation is an uncommon finding outside specific populations (e.g., children and male athletes), and when it occurs, it is often linked with preexisting joint vulnerability.2-4\nThe patient\u2019s history offers minimal evidence\nthat her behavior reflects an unconscious need to maintain a sick role, a hallmark of factitious disorder. Instead, there appears to be a strong correlation between her behavior and opioid ad- ministration, which would reflect secondary gain, a hallmark of malingering. I suspect that the best explanation of this patient\u2019s behavior lies at the intersection of substance use and deception syndrome.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Nicholas J. Kontos: After multiple psychiatric interviews, the patient reported that she had lied about her suicide attempt and had intentionally dislocated her elbows. She also reported that her goal in both cases was to obtain opioids, con- firming the diagnosis of malingering.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition,5 classifies malingering among \u201cother conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention.\u201d Malingering is not a psychiat- ric disorder. It can be distinguished from facti- tious disorder by the presence of behavior that is directed toward tangible gains, as opposed to behavior that is directed toward intangible sick- role gains. Sick-role gains include receiving care, being excused from duties, and being able to place blame on sickness.6 The line between tan- gible and intangible gains can be blurry; it is sometimes more important to describe and try to address the patient\u2019s goals than to distinguish between factitious disorder and malingering.\nThere is minimal evidence-based guidance for the identification of clinically significant decep- tion, particularly that involving psychological symptoms. The method for making an action- able diagnosis of malingering is unsettled, even in forensic situations, in which dedicated neuro- psychological tests are used.7,8 It is not surpris- ing that underidentification of malingering in the clinical setting is common.9,10\nThis patient reported a specific suicide at- tempt, with a motive and associated pain and fear, and she later reported elbow pain and im- mobility. At face value, this patient\u2019s history warranted concern from clinicians who were making decisions about safety precautions. How- ever, because the patient did not have physical findings (e.g., oropharyngeal lesions) or imag- ing findings that would support the reported ingestion and because she had disengaged from subjects about which she had initially expressed desperate concern, suspicions appropriately rose. Such suspicions might be inhibited by concerns about stigmatization, doctor\u2013patient rapport, and even liability.11 Allowing suspicion without cyni- cism or premature closure is an early hurdle in deception assessment.\nSome experts advise and others discourage confrontation of patients who have possible de- ception syndrome, and approaches to confronta- tion are seldom defined. An approach that is  incremental, honestly poses and compares conflicting points of view, and attends to the ethical implications of a potentially one-sided good-faith relationship13 is consistent with a \u201cfeedback mod- el,\u201d in which rapport and attention to reasons for deception are emphasized.14 In this case, con- frontation of the patient began with an unrecip- rocated attempt to engage and a statement of helpful intent. Then, inconsistencies in the avail- able information were addressed with curiosity and met with irritation from the patient. The next day, the patient explained her behavior but otherwise remained irritably disengaged. Con- tinued confrontation was eventually met with meaningful engagement, including participation in motivational interviewing.\nMost patients with deceptive behaviors do not readily explain those behaviors. Yet, misrepre- sented psychological symptoms are strongly sus- pected in up to 20% of psychiatric emergency department visits15 and reported anonymously by 8 to 10% of psychiatric inpatients.16-18 Nonethe- less, it is important for physicians to remain skeptical of their own intuitions about and strong reactions against possible deception. Phy- sicians have no special aptitude for detecting deception in unfamiliar patients.19 Medical rec- ords may provide a longitudinal perspective that reveals consistencies across presentations or in- consistencies within reports. A patient who is unfamiliar to an individual physician may be quite familiar at the institutional level. Close review of available records may be valuable when evaluating a patient with possible malingering.\n\n",
