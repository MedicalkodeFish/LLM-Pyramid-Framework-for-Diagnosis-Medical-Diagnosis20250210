    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Chidiebere D. Akusobi (Medicine): A 44-year-old woman was evaluated in the rheu- matology clinic of this hospital because of proximal muscle weakness and myalgia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when morning stiffness and pain developed in the small joints of both hands. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed elevated blood levels of anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies and rheumatoid factor, as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Rheumatoid arthritis was diag- nosed, but the patient chose not to begin specific therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.\nInstead, she began taking selenium, cod-liver oil, and turmeric as home remedies for joint pain. Morning stiffness and joint pain resolved after 4 weeks.\nFour years before the current presentation, treatment with hydroxychloroquine was started after the occurrence of another episode of morning stiffness and pain in the small joints of the hands. Three years before the current presentation, treat- ment with hydroxychloroquine was stopped after melasma developed. Treatment with methotrexate was initiated, but morning hand stiffness and pain recurred; methotrexate was replaced with leflunomide, and the symptoms in the hands subsequently decreased.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient began to have myalgia in the arms and thighs, as well as generalized fatigue. She  had difficulty raising  her arms above her head, and she could no longer  independently brush her hair or apply makeup. Myalgia worsened with exercise and was worst at the end of the day. The patient reported episodes of tingling in the hands and feet, but she  had no stiffness or pain in the small joints of her hands.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by a local rheumatologist and laboratory testing was performed. The blood level of creatine kinase was 422 U per liter (reference range, 40 to 150) and the lactate dehydrogenase level 509 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210). Antinuclear anti- bodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1:320 in a nuclear homogenous pattern,and anti\u2013U1-ribonucleoprotein (U1-RNP) anti- bodies were present. The blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal, and testing for anti\u2013double- stranded DNA (dsDNA) and anti-Smith antibod- ies was negative. Two months before the current presentation, treatment with azathioprine was started, and the patient was referred to the rheu- matology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, the patient report- ed ongoing myalgia and tingling in the hands  and feet but had noticed an improvement in her ability to raise her arms above her head after starting treatment with azathioprine. Two weeks earlier, episodes of muscle spasms in the hands and fingers had developed; massage of the hands had been performed to relax the spasms.\nThe patient had a history of Graves\u2019 disease, which had been complicated by ophthalmople- gia and had been treated with methimazole for  2 years, followed by radioactive iodine ablation 11 years before this presentation; hypothyroid- ism had developed after radioactive iodine abla- tion therapy. Other history included latent tuber- culosis infection, which had been treated with a 3-month course of isoniazid and rifampin, and hypoparathyroidism that had developed 9 years before this presentation. Medications included azathioprine, levothyroxine, calcium supple- ments, and calcitriol; the patient was unsure of the formulation and dose of calcium supplemen- tation. She lived outside the United States and traveled intermittently to Boston for specialized medical care. She lived with her mother and worked in information technology. She drank alcohol occasionally, smoked cigarettes, and used no illicit drugs. A sibling had systemic lu- pus erythematosus (SLE).\nOn examination, the temporal temperature\nwas 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/70 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She had mild exophthalmos in both eyes. There was an area of hyperpigmentation  on the face. The joints had a normal range of motion without tenderness on palpation; there was no synovitis. Neck flexion was mildly weak, as was hip flexion; strength was otherwise nor- mal, as was sensation. There was no rash. The remainder of the examination was normal.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Marcy B. Bolster: This 44-year-old woman with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis presented to the rheumatology clinic with a recent onset of fatigue, proximal  muscle  weakness,  myalgia in the arms and legs, paresthesia in the hands and feet, and muscle spasms in the hands. The available laboratory data showed elevated levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor, anti- CCP antibodies, ANA, and anti\u2013U1-RNP anti- bodies.\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nWhen I evaluate a patient with a history of a rheumatic disease, I first establish whether I agree with the previous diagnosis before proceeding with evaluation of the patient\u2019s current presenta- tion. Five years before this patient\u2019s current pre- sentation, she had symmetric small-joint polyar- thritis and was found to have positive tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies. The specificity of a positive test for anti-CCP anti- bodies for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is 95%; in combination with a positive test for rheumatoid factor, the specificity increases to 98%.1 Her presentation 5 years before the cur- rent presentation is clinically and serologically consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatoid ar- thritis.2 She had temporary abatement of arthri- tis after treatment with hydroxychloroquine fol- lowed by methotrexate. More recently, her rheumatoid arthritis was well managed with leflunomide therapy, and at the time of the cur- rent presentation, she had no symptoms or find- ings involving the joints.\nNow that I am comfortable with the previous\ndiagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, the next step is to determine whether the current presentation could be related to rheumatoid arthritis, a coex- isting condition, or a new condition. I will begin by considering categories of diseases that are associated with proximal muscle weakness and myalgia.\n\nAutoimmune Diseases\nProximal muscle weakness and myalgia are not characteristic clinical manifestations of rheuma- toid arthritis. However, other rheumatic condi- tions are high on the differential diagnosis in this patient with evidence of autoimmunity, on the basis of her diagnoses of rheumatoid arthritis, Graves\u2019 disease, and hypoparathyroidism (which can be caused by an autoimmune process) and given the fact that a first-degree relative has SLE. With overlap syndromes, a patient meets classi- fication criteria for two or more rheumatic con- ditions. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can have an overlap syndrome comprising rheuma- toid arthritis plus one or more other rheumatic conditions such as SLE, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, or systemic sclerosis. SLE, idiopathic inflammatory myopa- thies, and systemic sclerosis can be associated with proximal muscle weakness. This  patient did not have clinical features that would suggest Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome (e.g., keratoconjunctivitis sicca symptoms) or systemic sclerosis (e.g., Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon or skin thickening); other overlap syndromes merit consideration.\n\nOverlap Syndrome of Rheumatoid Arthritis and SLE\nCould this patient have an overlap syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and SLE? She is known to have had a positive ANA test; such antibodies can be present in patients with SLE. However, this autoantibody has low specificity and can also be present in patients with rheumatoid ar- thritis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, over- lap syndromes, mixed connective-tissue disease, and Graves\u2019 disease, as well as in first-degree relatives of patients with SLE. A positive anti\u2013 U1-RNP antibody test can also occur in patients with SLE. However, this patient did not have the typical clinical features of SLE, such as oral ul- cers, serositis, rash, and cytopenias. In addition, she recently had negative tests for anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies, and she had normal C3 and C4 levels. Overall, an overlap syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and SLE is unlikely.\n\nOverlap Syndrome of Rheumatoid Arthritis and Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathy\nThe classification criteria for idiopathic inflam- matory myopathies include proximal muscle weakness, laboratory abnormalities (e.g., a posi- tive anti\u2013Jo-1 antibody test or elevated blood levels of creatine kinase, aldolase, lactate dehydro- genase, alanine aminotransferase, or aspartate aminotransferase), rash (e.g., Gottron\u2019s papules, Gottron\u2019s sign, or heliotrope rash), esophageal dysmotility or dysphagia, and pathological find-\n \nings on muscle biopsy.3 An overlap syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and one of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies is possible in this patient who presented with proximal muscle weakness and elevated blood levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase.\nThere are several diagnoses within the spec- trum of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies to consider in this patient. Juvenile dermatomyosi- tis can be ruled out on the basis of her age. Al- though patients with inclusion-body myositis  can have symptoms that involve the hands, this patient did not have the characteristic weakness in the finger flexors that is associated with in- clusion-body myositis. In addition, she had a decrease in her symptoms after treatment with azathioprine was started, whereas patients with inclusion-body myositis typically do not have a rapid or strong clinical response to therapy. She did not have a rash, which makes dermatomyo- sitis unlikely. She was not taking a statin, and although statin use is not a requisite for the development of immune-mediated necrotizing myositis, it is a common association.4 Antisynthe- tase syndrome is associated with inflammatory arthritis and proximal muscle weakness, as well as Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, fever, interstitial lung disease, mechanic\u2019s hands (rough, cracking, dry skin most commonly located over the distal as- pects of the fingers and particularly involving the index finger [radial side] and thumb [ulnar side]), and the presence of an anti\u2013transfer RNA synthetase antibody.5,6 The patient\u2019s inflamma- tory arthritis was due to rheumatoid arthritis, and she did not have other clinical features that would suggest antisynthetase syndrome.\nAn overlap syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis\nand polymyositis remains a possible diagnosis in this patient. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve- conduction studies, magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) of the muscles, serologic testing to include evaluation for myositis-associated or myositis-specific autoantibodies, or a muscle biopsy could be pursued for further investiga- tion. However, polymyositis is typically charac- terized by proximal muscle weakness without myalgia, paresthesia, or muscle spasms.\n\nMixed Connective-Tissue Disease\nProximal muscle weakness is also a manifesta- tion of mixed connective-tissue disease. Mixed connective-tissue disease is characterized by the presence of anti\u2013U1-RNP antibodies in associa- tion with features of several different rheumatic conditions, without meeting classification crite- ria for any one disease. Although we know that this patient had a positive anti\u2013U1-RNP antibody test, we do not know the titer. If the titer of anti\u2013U1-RNP antibodies was low, it would have minimal clinical significance. Regardless, in this patient with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, an overlap syndrome is more likely than mixed connective-tissue disease.\n\nInfiltrative Diseases\nBoth amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can be mani- fested by proximal muscle weakness and can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome, which could explain the paresthesia in this patient\u2019s hands. Although a diagnosis of either amyloido- sis or sarcoidosis could explain her proximal muscle weakness and paresthesia, muscle spasms would be an unusual feature of either disease. The patient did not have any known chronic in- flammatory conditions, chronic kidney disease, rash, or macroglossia, features that would be suggestive of amyloidosis. In addition, she did not have lymphadenopathy, uveitis, or rash, which would be suggestive of sarcoidosis. I will consider other explanations for her presentation, but I would reconsider infiltrative disease if an alternative diagnosis were not identified.\n\nMedications\nMany medications have been associated with myalgia or proximal muscle weakness. The pa- tient\u2019s current medications included azathioprine (started 2 months before the current presenta- tion for muscle weakness) and longer-standing treatment with leflunomide (for rheumatoid ar- thritis), calcium supplementation and calcitriol (for hypoparathyroidism), and levothyroxine (for hypothyroidism that developed after treatment for Graves\u2019 disease). The patient\u2019s symptoms pre- dated azathioprine treatment, and she felt better after starting this medication; thus, an adverse effect from azathioprine would be unlikely to explain her presentation. Leflunomide can cause myalgia, but it has not specifically or commonly been associated with muscle weakness. Calcium supplements, calcitriol, and levothyroxine are not known to cause proximal muscle weakness. Previous medications have included metho- trexate, rifampin, isoniazid, methimazole, and hydroxychloroquine. Methotrexate and rifampin\n \n\nare not typically associated with muscle-related adverse effects. Although isoniazid, methima- zole, and hydroxychloroquine can have myo- pathic adverse effects, the use of each of these medications by this patient was remote and thus was not likely to have contributed to her current presentation.\n\nInfections\nThe bacterial infections that are most commonly associated with myalgia and proximal muscle weakness are those related to contiguous spread of Staphylococcus aureus infection. Infection with coxsackievirus B, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, hep- atitis B and C viruses, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can also be associated with myalgia and proximal muscle weakness. Fungal pathogens to consider include aspergil- lus,  cryptococcus,  and  Pneumocystis jirovecii,  and parasites to consider include trichinella and Toxoplasma gondii. The patient had been taking azathioprine for 2 months, so she was immuno- compromised. However, she did not have fever or other infectious signs or symptoms; thus, al- though an infectious process is possible, I think that it is unlikely to explain her current presen- tation.\n\nMetabolic Derangements\nPatients with metabolic myopathies that are re- lated to disorders of carbohydrate, lipid, or purine metabolism often have proximal muscle weak- ness. However, I would have expected this pa- tient to have had symptoms earlier in life if a metabolic myopathy was the cause.\nProximal muscle weakness can manifest in patients deficient in vitamin D, phosphorus, or calcium, as well as in patients with hypothyroid- ism or hyperthyroidism. This patient presented with not only muscle symptoms but also nerve symptoms (paresthesia and muscle spasms); therefore, I will focus on conditions that could explain both muscle and nerve symptoms.\nHypothyroidism can be associated with both muscle symptoms and paresthesia,  particularly in the context of carpal tunnel syndrome. This patient\u2019s treatment for Graves\u2019 disease resulted in hypothyroidism, and her levothyroxine re- placement dose could be too low. In addition, she has hypoparathyroidism, for which she was prescribed calcium supplementation and cal- citriol. She was uncertain of the formulation and dose of her calcium supplementation regimen, so it is possible that the calcium supplementa- tion has not been adequate. Hypoparathyroid- ism, with associated hypocalcemia, can be man- ifested by proximal muscle weakness and myalgia with the additional symptom of muscle spasms. Patients with profound hypocalcemia can have elevated creatine kinase levels. Overall, I suspect that hypocalcemia resulting from hy- poparathyroidism is the most likely explanation for her presentation. I suspect that the diagnos- tic test was a comprehensive metabolic panel, which would include measurement of blood lev- els of calcium and albumin.\n",

Grinspoon: Diagnostic laboratory test results obtained at the rheumatology clinic in- cluded a blood calcium level of 5.9 mg per deci- liter  (1.5  mmol  per  liter;  reference  range,  8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]) and a blood phosphorus level of 4.5 mg per deci- liter (1.5  mmol per liter; reference range,  2.6  to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]). The ionized calcium level, which reflects biologi- cally active calcium, was low, at 0.77 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.14 to 1.30). The  blood level of creatine kinase was 2645 U per liter.\nThe patient was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital for fur- ther evaluation and treatment of severe hypocal- cemia with symptoms. Additional test results in- cluded normal blood levels of albumin, creatinine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and thyrotropin. The blood level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) was inap- propriately normal, at 35 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60), which indicated hypoparathyroidism. The  phosphorus  level, which was at the upper limit of the reference range, was also consistent with hypoparathyroidism.\n",
