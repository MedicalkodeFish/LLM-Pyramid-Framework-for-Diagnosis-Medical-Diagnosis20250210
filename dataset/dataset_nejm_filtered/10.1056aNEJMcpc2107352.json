    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Ian D. Cooley (Medicine): A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital be- cause of painful mouth ulcers and weight loss.\nThe patient had been well until 6 weeks before the current admission, when painful mouth ulcers and neck pain developed. He was evaluated at an urgent care center. He had reduced range of motion of the neck due to pain with flexion, ex- tension, and rotation, but there was no spinal tenderness. There were small ulcers on the lower lip and gingivae. Cyclobenzaprine and acyclovir were prescribed.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his pri- mary care physician in a clinic at this hospital. He reported that neck pain on the right side and oral ulcers had persisted and that several new oral ulcers had devel- oped. He had no rash, eye pain, joint pain or swelling, dysuria or genital lesions, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The examination was notable for several large ulcers on the lips and tongue (Fig. 1A). Treatment with acyclovir was continued. A direct immunofluorescence assay of a swab of an oral ulcer was negative for herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and for varicella\u2013zoster virus. Blood tests were negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and for syphilis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the dermatology clinic for further evaluation of the oral ulcers.\nBefore the patient could be evaluated in the dermatology clinic, his mouth ul- cers and pain worsened. Four weeks before the current admission, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital. Erythema and watering of the left eye had developed, as had new skin lesions on the trunk and upper face. The examina- tion revealed multiple ulcers on the lips and tongue (Fig. 1B) and two pink crusted papules with hemorrhage on the right temple. There were scattered pus- tules on the lower back and right flank. An ophthalmologic examination revealed a pinguecula on the nasal side of the right eye with mild surrounding inflamma- tion but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were nor- mal, as were results of kidney- and liver-function tests. HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele; other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1.\nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatol- ogy and dermatology services. The decision was made to pursue a skin biopsy before an oral bi- opsy. A biopsy of a pustule on the patient\u2019s back was performed, and examination of the speci- men revealed mild spongiosis, neutrophilic granulomatous inflammation, and a superficial perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and occasional eosinophils. Colchi- cine was prescribed, along with oxycodone and lidocaine oral solution, for the treatment of a working diagnosis of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Outpa- tient follow-up with the rheumatology service was arranged.\nThree days after discharge from the emergen- cy department, the patient reported that the oral ulcers had not abated. Treatment with predni- sone was started, and colchicine was continued. Two weeks before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital. Prednisone treatment had led to only transient healing of the oral ulcers. The patient had pain with eating and speaking and had lost 10 kg of body weight in 3 weeks. The neck pain, the eye watering, and several skin le- sions had resolved. The examination revealed ex- tensive ulceration of the upper and lower labial mucosa and of the ventrolateral surface of the tongue on both sides, as well as two focal ulcer- ations, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, involving the soft palate on the left side (Fig. 1C and 1D). There were multiple purple-red, scaly papules involving the skin of the arms and lower legs. There was no evidence of a joint abnormality. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Prednisone was switched to oral methylpredniso- lone, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started for possible bowel-associated derma- tosis\u2013arthritis syndrome. Omeprazole, which the patient had taken for many years, was stopped because of peripheral eosinophilia. An evaluation in the oral medicine clinic at an affiliated hospi- tal was arranged, with plans for oral and skin biopsies.\nOne week before the current admission, a biopsy of lower labial mucosa revealed squamous mucosa and parenchyma of the minor salivary glands, with mild nonspecific chronic inflam- mation. A skin biopsy was notable for epidermal ulceration with impetiginization and associated folliculitis. Dexamethasone oral rinses were prescribed, as was trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxa- zole for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci infection.\nDuring the next 7 days, the ulcers worsened and the patient had ongoing pain that was unre- sponsive to oxycodone. He was unable to eat and was admitted to this hospital for pain control and further evaluation.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included gastro- esophageal reflux disease. Medications includ- ed methylprednisolone, colchicine, amoxicillin\u2013 clavulanate, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, lorazepam, and oxycodone, as well as dexa- methasone oral rinses. The patient was allergic to clarithromycin, which had caused a rash. He had quit smoking 30 years earlier, and he con- sumed 10 alcoholic drinks per week. There was no illicit drug use. The patient lived with his wife in a suburban area of New England. He had traveled to Western Europe, Mexico, and the Caribbean. He was employed part-time as a con- tractor. His family history included prostate cancer in his father and type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/56 mm Hg, the heart rate 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.4. The patient looked uncomfort- able, with an edematous tongue and multiple oral ulcers. There was no cervical lymphadenopa- thy or joint abnormality. Skin examination re- vealed a slightly raised pustule, measuring 2 mm in diameter, on the anterior aspect of the thigh. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Markus Y. Wu: Computed tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen, performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle centrilobular ground-glass opac- ities in the upper lobes of the lungs, as well as prominent right hilar and left supraclavicular lymph nodes, each measuring 1 cm in diameter (Fig. 2).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sook-Bin Woo: This 68-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of progressively worsening painful mouth ulcers associated with weight loss and the development of scaly papules on the skin. He had been treated with acyclovir, colchi- cine, prednisone, and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, but the oral ulcers had not abated.\n\nEvaluation of Oral Ulcers\nEvaluation of oral ulcers begins with determina- tion of whether the patient has a single lesion or multiple lesions and whether the process is epi- sodic or continuous (Fig. 3). This patient had multiple ulcers that had developed abruptly, with subsequent resolution of some ulcers and devel- opment of others at the same time, so that he was never ulcer-free. This combination of find- ings rules out conditions associated with a sin- gle episodic ulcer, including traumatic ulcers, which usually result from a defined traumatic event; solitary progressive ulcers due to cancer; and recurrent idiopathic aphthous ulcers, a com- mon condition that almost always begins in the second or third decade of life and is character- ized by ulcers that measure less than 1 cm in diameter. Patients with recurrent idiopathic aph- thous ulcers have ulcer-free periods between the episodes. There is an uncommon variant of the condition, known as severe recurrent aphthous ulcers or complex aphthosis, in which patients have continuous ulcers.1 However, I am cautious about making a new diagnosis of recurrent idio- pathic aphthous ulcers in patients older than 50 years of age, because the symptoms in question are more likely to represent another condition, such as aphthous-like ulcers that are caused by medications or are related to systemic disease.\n\nSystemic Disease\nThe presence of oral ulcers is one of the defining criteria of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, but the oral ulcers associated with this disease tend to wax and wane and often respond to colchicine and glucocorticoid therapy.2 In addition, this patient did not have genital, ocular, or typical cutaneous symptoms of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Although HLA typing was positive for the HLA-B51 allele, this test is not highly specific for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease and is positive in approximately 18% of the gen- eral population.3 Crohn\u2019s disease and infection with HIV type 1 are frequently associated with oral ulcers, but testing for HIV was negative and the patient had no symptoms suggestive of Crohn\u2019s disease.4,5\n\nViral Infection\nCould a viral infection be the cause of this pa- tient\u2019s oral ulcers? The acute onset of multiple ulcers often occurs in patients with viral ill- nesses. Infection with HSV must be considered in this patient. Primary HSV infection is characterized by a prodrome of fever and malaise, and painful clustered ulcers (ruptured vesicles) de- velop on both the nonkeratinized and the kera- tinized tissue of the tongue dorsum, hard pala- tal mucosa, and gingiva.6 These lesions often coalesce to form irregularly shaped ulcers that resolve within several weeks. This patient did not have a prodrome and the ulcers did not re- solve over a 6-week period, so primary HSV infection is unlikely.\nWhen reactivation of latent HSV infection oc- curs in healthy persons, clustered ulcers develop on the vermilion of the lip (herpes labialis) and involve only keratinized oral tissue. When HSV reactivation occurs in immunocompromised persons, ulcers may develop on any part of the oral mucosa, and multiple ulcers (similar to those seen in primary HSV infection) or a single ulcer may form.7 Although we do not know whether this patient was immunocompromised, testing of a specimen obtained from the ulcer was negative for HSV and varicella\u2013zoster virus, and his con- dition did not improve with the use of acyclovir. Overall, HSV infection is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\nMucocutaneous ulcers caused by other members of the herpesviridae family, such as cyto- megalovirus or Epstein\u2013Barr virus, are generally solitary and often occur in immunocompromised or immunosenescent persons; ulcers caused by deep fungal infections or syphilis may be multifocal.8-10 This patient had negative tests for cyto- megalovirus IgG, treponemal antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. On testing for Epstein\u2013 Barr virus, he was seropositive for IgG but nega- tive for IgM, which is an antibody pattern consistent with previous infection.\nAutoimmune Vesiculobullous Disease\nCould this patient\u2019s ulcers be ruptured blisters? The continuous occurrence of multiple oral ul- cers, without ulcer-free periods, is a frequent finding in patients with autoimmune blistering diseases, such as pemphigus vulgaris. Because the mouth is a trauma-intense environment, vesicles and bullae typically rupture to form ero- sions and ulcers, and intact blisters are a rare oral finding.11 Oral ulcers caused by pemphigus vulgaris can occur at any site but have a predilec- tion for the palatal mucosa, and they may be several centimeters in diameter; these features are similar to those seen in this patient.12 Many patients with pemphigus vulgaris initially present with oral ulcers, which can last for months be- fore skin lesions develop.\nMucous membrane pemphigoid occurs in the oral cavity at a much greater frequency than pemphigus vulgaris. However, mucous mem- brane pemphigoid is more likely to cause des- quamative gingivitis, characterized by diffuse gingival erosions and erythema, which was not present in this patient.12 This patient\u2019s ulcers could be a manifestation of oral bullous pem- phigoid, but the skin findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.12 Furthermore, the oral bi- opsy did not reveal either acantholysis (a finding characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris) or subepi- thelial clefting (a finding associated with pem- phigoid). Unfortunately, the biopsy specimen lacked an intact epithelium\u2013connective tissue interface and was suboptimal for evaluation. Al- though an additional biopsy could be considered, the absence of antibodies targeting desmoglein 1 and 3 rules out pemphigus vulgaris. The pa- tient had low titers of antibodies targeting bul- lous pemphigoid antigens 180 and 230, but his overall clinical presentation and lack of response to glucocorticoids rule out pemphigoid.\n\nParaneoplastic Disease\nPatients with paraneoplastic pemphigus, also known as paraneoplastic autoimmune multi- organ syndrome, usually have extensive skin in- volvement that mimics pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigoid, graft-versus-host disease, erythema multiforme, and lichen planus. The cancers most frequently associated with paraneoplastic pem- phigus are non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, and thymoma. Patients with paraneoplastic pemphi- gus may have extensive ulceration of the mouth, often with hemorrhagic crusts on the lips.13 This patient\u2019s oral ulcers could be consistent with oral involvement by paraneoplastic pemphigus, especially the pemphigus variant. However, he did not have a known underlying cancer and his skin lesions were fairly mild, which would be unusual for this diagnosis. If there is a strong suspicion for paraneoplastic pemphigus, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoprecipitation for envoplakin and periplakin are helpful tests, along with further evaluation for an occult cancer.\n\nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms\nThis patient\u2019s peripheral eosinophilia suggests the possibility of drug reaction with eosino- philia and systemic symptoms (DRESS),14 which occurs as a hypersensitivity reaction to medica- tions such as allopurinol and anticonvulsants and less often to viral infections. Oral lesions are not frequently reported with DRESS. Moreover, liver injury is a hallmark of this disease, and this patient had normal liver function.\nThe finding of eosinophilia in this patient is worrisome, especially because he was receiving systemic glucocorticoid therapy. In addition, his ulcers did not abate despite methylprednisolone therapy, and he was noted to have lost 10 kg of body weight over a 3-week period. Taken together, these signs and symptoms are sug- gestive of a systemic disease such as a blood dyscrasia.\n\nLeukemia\nWas this patient\u2019s presentation caused by a hema- topoietic stem-cell disorder? The most common oral manifestation of acute leukemia is boggy, erythematous gingival hyperplasia that results from neoplastic infiltration of the gingiva. This finding is usually seen in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.15 However, patients with other myeloid neoplasms, especially those with eosin- ophilic leukemia, may also have oral ulcers that result from leukemic infiltration, which is likely to be associated with neutropenia.16\nAlthough this patient did not have evidence of leukemic cells on oral biopsy, the diagnosis of leukemia would account for his weight loss, worsening ulcers that did not respond to ther- apy, and increasing eosinophilia despite treat- ment with glucocorticoids. To establish the di- agnosis in this case, I would recommend a bone marrow biopsy.\n",

    "Key testing result": "elements, including eosinophils (Fig. 4C). On tryptase immunostaining (Fig. 4D), there was an increased number of mast cells, many of which were abnormally elongated; the mast cells had aberrant expression of CD25. Flow cytometric studies of both blood and bone marrow did not reveal any abnormal T-cell or B-cell populations. On the basis of these findings, the differen- tial diagnosis included a reactive eosinophilia, as well as myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia. Given the increased number of mast cells, systemic mastocytosis was a diagnostic consideration. However, with systemic mastocy- tosis, mast cells typically form dense aggregates and there would usually be an elevated serum tryptase level.18\nMyeloid neoplasms associated with clonal eosinophilia include several genetically defined entities, which underscores the importance of genetic testing in the workup of unexplained eosinophilia. Such entities include chronic my- eloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1\u2013positive (with the diag- nosis based on the detection of BCR-ABL1 re- arrangement), and neoplasms of myeloid or lymphoid lineage with rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, or PCM1-JAK2. If these genetic translocations are absent and other clonal ge- netic aberrations are present on karyotyping or next-generation sequencing or there are increased blasts, a diagnosis known as chronic eosino- philic leukemia, not otherwise specified, is rendered. Unexplained persistent eosinophilia that is not associated with genetic proof of clonality or increased blasts but is associated with end- organ damage due to eosinophilia is placed in the category of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.\nIn this patient, the bone marrow karyotype was normal. However, the most common rearrange- ment partner of PDGFRA is FIP1L1, which is lo- cated in the same region on chromosome 4 as PDGFRA. These genes are juxtaposed through a small intrachromosomal deletion that cannot be detected on conventional karyotyping, and thus assessment for the FIP1L1\u2013PDGFRA fusion must be performed with other genetic tests. An inter- phase fluorescence in situ hybridization study performed on a bone marrow specimen from this patient revealed a deletion of the LNX locus, which lies between FIP1L1 and PDGFRA (Fig. 4E). In addition, a next-generation sequencing\u2013based RNA fusion assay performed on a blood speci- men revealed a chimeric transcript, which re- flected an in-frame fusion between FIP1L1 (exon 9) and PDGFRA (exon 12) (Fig. 4F). A next-genera- tion sequencing\u2013based multiplex mutation screen- ing assay (SNaPshot), performed to assess for mutations in 104 genes associated with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, detected the mutations RUNX1 p.Phe158Tyr (c.473T\u2192A) (variant allele frequency, 18%) and RUNX1 p.Arg166HisfsTer11 (c.496_497insAC) (variant allele frequency, 11%). A KIT mutation was not detected, a finding that provided further evidence against the possibility of systemic mastocytosis. Overall, these find- ings confirm the diagnosis of a myeloid neo- plasm with PDGFRA rearrangement, manifesting as chronic eosinophilic leukemia.\n\nFigure 4 (facing page). Blood and Bone Marrow Specimens. Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of the blood (Panel A) shows an increased number of eosinophils, which have normal granulation and occasional cytoplasmic vacuolization.\nWright\u2013Giemsa staining of a smear of bone marrow as- pirate (Panel B) shows normal maturation of myeloid and lymphoid lineages and a slightly increased number of eosinophils; there are no dysplastic features. Hema- toxylin and eosin staining of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Panel C) shows hypercellularity for the pa- tient\u2019s age (70% cells and 30% fat) and a relative pre- dominance of myeloid cells, with a mildly increased number of eosinophils. Tryptase immunostaining of the bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Panel D) shows frequent interstitial mast cells, including abnormally elongated and spindled forms. On interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization performed on bone marrow (Panel E) with the use of probes to LNX (in red), SCFD2 (in green), and PDGFRA (in aqua), the nucleus shows one chromosome with all three signals intact and another chromosome with intact SCFD2 and PDGFRA signals but without the LNX signal. This finding indicates a deletion of the re- gion between FIP1L1 and PDGFRA on chromosome 4q12, as shown on the diagram on the right side of the panel, adapted from Cools et al.17; the abbreviation \u201ccen\u201d denotes the centromeric portion of the chromosome. On a next- generation sequencing\u2013based RNA fusion assay per- formed on blood (Panel F), a transition from the se- quence of exon 9 of FIP1L1 (left side of the panel) to the sequence of exon 12 of PDGFRA (right side of the panel) indicates that a chimeric RNA transcript has re- sulted from the gene fusion.\n",
