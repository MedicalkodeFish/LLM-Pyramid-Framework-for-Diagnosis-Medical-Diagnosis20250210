    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Emma C. Materne (Pediatrics): A 12-month-old boy with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nFifteen days before the current admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.7\u00b0C. His parents noticed that he was fussy and less active than usual and that he had a decreased appetite along with several episodes of \u201cspitting up\u201d; there was no vomiting or diarrhea. During the next 5 days, fever occurred daily and abated with the administration of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ten days before the cur- rent admission, a bowel movement with watery, nonbloody, foul-smelling, mustard- yellow stool occurred. The patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the patient was irritable. The abdomen was soft and non- tender. There were well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques on the abdomen, legs, feet, and forearms. The alanine aminotransferase level was 131 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the aspartate aminotransferase level 250 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 80), the ferritin level 3826 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 30 to 300), and the d-dimer level 3218 ng per milliliter (reference range, <500). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 40 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15); the white-cell count was normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A radiograph of the abdomen showed gas-filled loops of bowel. The rectum was irrigated, and intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered. On the third hospital day, the patient was afebrile and able to take formula, and the diarrhea abated. He was discharged home with a prescription for a course of metro- nidazole.\nDuring the next 2 days, the patient had no fever or diarrhea. However, 4 days before the current admission, a day-care worker observed that the patient appeared tired. During the subsequent 3 days at home, fever again developed, with chills and a decreased appetite. The day before the current admission, the patient cried through the night. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nThe parents reported that the patient was fussy and had poor sleep and generalized weak- ness; there was no diarrhea or new rash. The parents did not think that the patient was in pain. Additional history was obtained from the parents. The patient had met developmental milestones until 1 month earlier, when he had stopped crawling. He had previously been able to pull his body into a standing position, but he no longer attempted this maneuver. If he was placed in a standing position, he collapsed; if he was placed in a sitting position, he was able to stay upright. He had previously passed objects from hand to hand, but he had a new preference of holding objects with the left hand. Two days before this evaluation, the parents had noticed that the patient no longer walked with support; he seemed to dislike having his hands held.\nThe patient had cornea plana and a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, for which he had under- gone laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and an anal pull-through procedure at 2 months of age. Four months before the current evaluation, an intermittent diffuse rash on the trunk, arms, and legs had developed. The rash was character- ized by purplish and pinkish plaques that ap- peared and varied in intensity of color through- out the day; it did not seem to be itchy or painful and usually resolved within 24 hours without treatment.\nImmunizations were up to date. Medications included metronidazole, acetaminophen, ibupro- fen, and cetirizine, as well as carboxymethylcel- lulose eye drops; there were no known allergies to medications. The patient lived with his moth- er, father, and pet dog in a small town in New England, and he attended day care 5 days per week. His mother was healthy, and his father had irritable bowel syndrome and Poland syn- drome (congenital aplasia of unilateral chest-wall muscles). His paternal grandmother had hypo- thyroidism, his maternal great-grandfather had had pancreatic cancer, his paternal great-grand- father had had breast cancer, a maternal second cousin had autism, and multiple maternal fam- ily members had Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 113/52 mm Hg, the heart rate 166 beats per minute (normal range for age, 80 to 160), and the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute (normal range for age, 30 to 60). The patient was diaphoretic and irritable, and he cried during the examination. He had rhinorrhea. The abdomen was not distended or tender. There was limited extension of the wrists and knees, as well as limited inversion and eversion of the feet. The ankles were mildly stiff, and the feet were mildly swollen. There were erythematous plaques on the abdomen, back, arms, and legs (Fig. 1).\nThe ferritin and d-dimer levels remained elevated, and the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 75 mm per hour, the white-cell count 26,820 per microliter (reference range, 6000 to 17,500), and the plate- let count 682,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood cultures and urinaly- sis were normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: A radiograph of the chest and abdomen was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed cholelithiasis and promi- nent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Ultrasonography of the legs revealed a small amount of joint f luid in the hips and knees (Fig. 2); the amount of fluid appeared to be within the normal range. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder, without gallbladder distention. There were a few prominent lymph nodes in the paraaortic, iliac, and inguinal regions (Fig. 2). Transtho- racic echocardiography showed normal coronary arteries.\nDr. Materne: The empirical administration of intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni- dazole was begun. During the next 3 days, the fever continued and the white-cell count re- mained elevated. On the seventh hospital day, the fever, leukocytosis, and elevation in levels of inflammatory markers persisted. The adminis- tration of antibiotic agents was stopped.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Madeleine I. Matthiesen: I was a member of the team that cared for this patient, and I am aware of the final diagnosis. This 12-month-old boy with a history of Hirschsprung\u2019s disease was admitted to the hospital with fever.\nInitially, we considered the most likely causes of this child\u2019s febrile illness. At this point, sys- tem 1 thinking \u2014 or fast thinking \u2014 was acti- vated. System 1 thinking involves intuitive and efficient pattern recognition, frequently relying on epidemiology and the health care provider\u2019s experience. This type of thinking allows provid- ers to make thousands of rapid clinical decisions each day and, in this case, led to the immediate administration of antibiotics and a workup for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and related illnesses.\nOne problem with system 1 thinking is the difficulty distinguishing appropriate from inap- propriate heuristic activation. A heuristic is an automatically and unconsciously deployed men- tal shortcut that can facilitate rapid decision making. Heuristics have the potential to be based on invalid relationships and thus to repre- sent cognitive bias.1 To avoid cognitive bias, de- liberate reflection is critical.\nThus, we used deliberate reflection to con- sider the aspects of the case that did and did not fit the given diagnoses; this process re- vealed system 1 thinking to be incorrect. At this point, system 2 thinking \u2014 or slow thinking\n\u2014 was activated. Although it is time-intensive, system 2 thinking is an important tool for con- sideration of a broad differential diagnosis in the context of diagnostic uncertainty and, in this case, led to further exploration of the patient\u2019s developmental regression, lymphadenopathy, and rash in the presence of persistent fever that did not abate despite the administration of anti- biotics.\nHirschsprung-Associated Enterocolitis Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization among pa- tients with Hirschsprung\u2019s disease; it occurs in approximately one third of patients with Hirsch- sprung\u2019s disease.2 Because epidemiologic associa- tions are a key contributor to system 1 thinking, this diagnosis was considered and treatment was initiated immediately.\nAlthough this patient had undergone sigmoid colectomy, some risk for Hirschsprung-associat- ed enterocolitis was still present postoperatively because of bacterial translocation.3 The symp- toms that had resulted in his first hospitaliza- tion, including abdominal distention, diarrhea, and fever, were all consistent with this diagnosis. Deliberate reflection on this system 1 diagno-  sis revealed inappropriate anchoring on the diag- nosis established during the previous hospital- ization. The description of the patient\u2019s stool, the resolution of abdominal distention before fever recrudescence, and the ongoing fever de- spite the multiple-day course of antibiotics all made the diagnosis of Hirschsprung-associated\nenterocolitis unlikely.\n\nMultisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nSystem 1 thinking also led us to consider Covid-19 and related illnesses, since the patient presented with fever and evidence of systemic inflamma- tion during the pandemic. Although Covid-19 was unlikely because of the low community positivity rates at the time and negative testing for SARS-CoV-2, the patient was hospitalized in part out of concern about multisystem inflam- matory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\nAn availability heuristic is a cognitive bias that in this case connected the patient\u2019s presen- tation to examples of MIS-C that came easily to mind in the weeks after the first wave of Covid-19 in this region. However, the estimated incidence of MIS-C is 2 to 5 per 1 million children,4-6 and on deliberate reflection, the patient did not meet the criteria for MIS-C outlined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention7; he had neither recent evidence of Covid-19 nor involvement of multiple (at least two) organ systems, with some combination of active cardiac, respiratory, hema- tologic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, or neuro- logic symptoms at presentation.\n\nFever of Unknown Origin\nBecause system 1 thinking did not lead to iden- tification of the diagnosis, system 2 thinking was activated, allowing for a systematic approach to the differential diagnosis with the use of a diag- nostic schema. Schemas require a specific clini- cal finding to be used as a hook, and it was critical to determine the features of this case that represented the \u201csignal\u201d in the foreground of the illness, rather than the \u201cnoise\u201d in the background.\nThree days into the patient\u2019s hospitalization, he was considered to have fever of unknown origin, given that the initial treatment and workup had neither elucidated the diagnosis nor led to clinical improvement. Fever of unknown origin was used as the first hook. It was un- doubtedly a signal, because it had to be ex- plained by the final diagnosis. It was also cho- sen because it would allow us to form a broad differential diagnosis, activating a diagnostic schema that begins with a comparison of infec- tious and noninfectious causes.\nInfection\nIn cases of fever of unknown origin, infections are most commonly identified as the cause,8-10 and this patient was initially treated for bacte- rial infection. However, as his hospital course progressed without improvement in his symp- toms, causes of ongoing fever despite the ad- ministration of antibiotics were considered.\nFirst, infection with inadequate control of the source could explain ongoing fever despite anti- biotic therapy. An occult abscess was not detected on either abdominal CT or chest radiography, and focal bony tenderness would be expected if the patient were to have osteomyelitis.\nSecond, infection with inadequate antibiotic coverage due to the presence of multidrug-resis-\n \n\ntant organisms or a pathogen not covered by the empirical regimen was considered. In an other- wise healthy, immunocompetent boy who was receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and had negative blood cultures, infection with a multi- drug-resistant organism was unlikely. Tickborne infections such as anaplasmosis that require treatment with doxycycline typically cause leu- kopenia and abnormal results on liver-function tests, findings that were not present in this case. Third, the fever may not have been due to bacterial infection. Several viruses \u2014 including Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesvirus 6 \u2014 were considered, but the pres- ence of fever, the normal results on liver-func- tion tests, and the absence of an acute rash and oropharyngeal findings made these diagnoses unlikely. Systemic mycobacterial infection would be uncommon in a healthy boy without a history of travel and with a negative chest radiograph. Only noninfectious causes remain serious considerations in this case.\n\nDevelopmental Regression\nThe time course of the appearance of symptoms may be an important factor in narrowing the differential diagnosis in this case. It was ini- tially unclear whether the patient\u2019s subacute developmental regression was related to his current presentation, but as the fever shifted into a subacute time frame, regression was brought to the foreground. To narrow the dif- ferential diagnosis further, the overlap of fever of unknown origin and regression of crawling was explored.\nCauses of crawl regression can be grouped into mechanical causes, neuromuscular causes, and pain. Mechanical and neuromuscular causes were unlikely in this patient, given the presence of fever and the subacute time course without a focal neurologic deficit. Pain may be due to in- fection, cancer, and immune-mediated causes. Since infection had already been addressed, cancer and immune-mediated diagnoses were considered.\nIn 2 to 15% of cases of fever of unknown origin, cancer is identified as the cause,8-10 and tumors in the limbs can cause pain that leads to crawl regression. At 12 months of age, primary bone tumors are rare, but neuroblastoma is common and can cause fever, as well as crawl regression when bone metastasis is present.\nHowever, no abdominal mass was identified on imaging studies in this case.\nNearly two thirds of patients with leukemia present with musculoskeletal symptoms due in part to overcrowding of bone marrow by cancer cells,11 and leukemia is one of the most common cancers identified in patients with fever of un- known origin. However, thrombocytosis is a rare finding in pediatric patients with leukemia, and with this patient\u2019s profound leukocytosis, immature forms would be expected on a manual cell count.\nIn up to 25% of cases of fever of unknown origin, immune-mediated conditions are identi- fied as the cause.8-10 To narrow the list of pos- sible immune-mediated causes in a patient with fever of unknown origin and crawl regression due to pain, the additional systemic findings of lymphadenopathy and rash were brought to the foreground.\nKawasaki\u2019s disease is an important consider- ation in any child with fever and can cause lymphadenopathy, rash, and crawl regression due to arthritis. However, in patients with Kawa- saki\u2019s disease, lymphadenopathy typically occurs in the cervical lymph-node chain, and the nodes tend to be larger in size than those observed in this patient. The absence of coronary changes on echocardiography in the presence of ongoing fever was also reassuring.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus can also cause fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and crawl regres- sion. However, the rash classically associated with this illness would not disappear, and addi- tional neurologic and renal findings and lupus- specific antibodies would be present.\nSystemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which is a diagnosis to consider only after ruling out infec- tion and cancer, could explain all the features of this case. The classification criteria include ar- thritis, fever for 2 weeks, and one of the follow- ing four symptoms: evanescent rash, generalized lymphadenopathy,  hepatomegaly or splenomega-\nly, or serositis (Table 2).12 Although the peak onset of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis occurs at 2 years of age, diagnosis in a 12-month- old child is not uncommon.13 The laboratory findings of thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers are all consistent with the diagnosis. With a condition as rare as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which has an estimated incidence of 0.5 per 100,000 children,14 it is important to practice deliberate reflection to consider the aspects of the case that do or do not fit with the diagnosis. The rash classically associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis evanesces with fever. In this patient, the rash was certainly evanescent in its rapid resolution, but it occurred months before fever and arthritis, which was unusual. Also, it was unclear whether the patient\u2019s lymph- adenopathy was a remnant of the previous infec- tion, rather than evidence of systemic inflam-\nmation.\nArthritis had not been confirmed in the pa- tient. Pediatric arthritis can be challenging to diagnose because children often cannot identify stiffness or pain, instead showing a change in gait or function, as was seen in this patient.15 Arthritic joints are typically warm but not ery- thematous; the knee, ankle, and wrist are most commonly affected.15 Arthritis could explain this patient\u2019s crawl regression, the apparent pain when his hands were held, and the stiffness identified on examination of the joints.\nThe most likely diagnosis in this patient was systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. He met the criteria for this condition, given the presence of arthritis, fever, lymphadenopathy, and possibly rash. Because ultrasonography had been nega- tive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to obtain a more sensitive view of the joints and to rule out occult osteomyelitis and tumor. The presence of widespread lymphade- nopathy on MRI would further support the diag- nosis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. If arthritis were absent but more accessible lymph nodes were identified, diagnostic biopsy would have been considered.\n",
