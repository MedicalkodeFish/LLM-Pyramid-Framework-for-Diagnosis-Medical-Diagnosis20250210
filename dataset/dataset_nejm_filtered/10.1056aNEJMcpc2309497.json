    "Primary Symptom": "A  29-Year-Old  Man with Sickle Cell Disease and Right Hip Pain",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Ya Haddy Sallah (Medicine): A 29-year-old man with sickle cell disease was ad- mitted to this hospital because of pain in the right hip.\nThe patient had received a diagnosis of sickle cell disease in childhood. The  sickle cell disease had been complicated by vaso-occlusive events with pain severe enough to lead to hospitalization 3 or 4 times per year. He also had a history of osteonecrosis of the hips that had led  to treatment with total hip  arthroplasty of both hips 3 years before the current presentation.\nSeven days before the current presentation, the patient presented to this hospi- tal with pain in the low back, hips, and legs, which had developed 1 day after he had carried boxes up several flights of stairs. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. He was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. F. Joseph Simeone: Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs of the chest (Fig. 1A)\nshowed normal lungs and a normal cardiac silhouette; superior and inferior end- plate depressions in midthoracic vertebral bodies were noted. Frontal and lateral radiographs of the lumbar spine (Fig. 1B) showed superior and inferior end-plate depressions at multiple vertebral levels and diffuse bony sclerosis, findings consis- tent with bony changes from sickle cell disease. An anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis (Fig. 1C) showed evidence of total hip arthroplasty; the findings had not changed from those observed on recently obtained radiographs.\nDr. Sallah: A diagnosis of a painful vaso-occlusive event was made, and treatment included intravenous fluids, ketorolac, and hydromorphone. Musculoskeletal strain was considered to be a contributing factor for the pain, given the recent strenuous activity. The pain slowly abated, and on hospital day 5, the patient was discharged home.\nOne day after discharge, and 2 days before the current presentation, pain in the right hip developed while the patient was at rest. Despite treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, the hip pain worsened, and the patient was unable to walk.  He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported pain in the right hip that felt different in quality from the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. He also reported pleuritic chest pain that felt similar in quality to the pain associated with previous vaso-occlusive events. The tympanic temperature measured at home was 37.8\u00b0C.\nDuring the 6 months before the current pre- sentation, vaso-occlusive events had increased in frequency and severity. There had been three hos- pital admissions with a duration of 4 to 8 days, including one admission for acute chest syn- drome. The pain associated with vaso-occlusive events typically involved the chest, arms, or thighs. There was a history of automated red- cell exchange, which had been performed before total hip arthroplasty; there was also a history of four blood transfusions. Other history included tinnitus, symmetric high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, and cholelithiasis. Medications included voxelotor and folic acid, as well as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and hydro- morphone as needed for pain. The patient had no known allergies. He lived in a suburb of Boston and worked as an engineer. He had trav- eled to West Africa 1 year before the current presentation and to South Asia 3 weeks before the current presentation. He drank alcohol oc- casionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. Both of his parents and his brother had sickle cell trait.\nThe temporal temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/56 mm Hg, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. He had mild tenderness on palpation of the right hip but no obvious deformity; there was a well- healed incision without overlying erythema. He was able to fully extend and flex the right hip, but such movement caused mild discomfort. There was moderate discomfort with the log-roll test (rolling the thigh internally and externally with the patient in the supine position). The re- mainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-func- tion and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 15,680 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the hemoglobin level 7.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the platelet count 581,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood C-reactive protein level was 100.6 mg per liter (reference val- ue, <8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 113 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 14). Nucleic acid amplification testing for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Simeone: Findings on radiographs of the chest, hips, and pelvis were unchanged from those observed 7 days earlier.\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sharl S. Azar: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagnosis. Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening inherited blood disorder that affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States alone.1 Its hallmark, and the reason most patients seek care in the clinic or hospital, is acute painful vaso-occlusive events.2 Although pain is one of the most recog- nizable symptoms of sickle cell disease, the disease affects nearly every organ system, and pain can often be the harbinger of clinically significant complications. This patient\u2019s presen- tation illustrates an important challenge  faced by both patients with sickle cell disease and the providers caring for them: determining whether a patient\u2019s pain is the result of an uncomplicated painful vaso-occlusive event or a symptom of another complication associated with sickle cell disease.\n\nUncomplicated Painful Vaso-occlusive Event When evaluating pain in this patient with sickle cell disease, the first question is whether his pre- sentation is caused by an uncomplicated painful vaso-occlusive event. This manifestation of sickle cell disease occurs most frequently in patients 19 to 39 years of age and can be brought on by several stressors, including environmental, psy- chosocial, or physiological changes.2,3 Often, no\nclear source of the pain can be identified. This patient had been hospitalized for a vaso-occlu- sive event only 7 days before this admission, which suggests the possibility that the previous episode had not been completely treated and that the pain had relapsed or persisted. On the current presentation, the patient reported that his chest pain was consistent with previous events. However, he reported that his hip pain was different from previous events. Although an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive event is possible, the report of atypical pain prompts a broader evaluation.\n\nAcute Chest Syndrome\nCould this patient have acute chest syndrome? Among patients with sickle cell disease, the life- time risk of acute chest syndrome is 30 to 50%; it is the second most common cause of hospital- ization and a leading cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease.4,5 Clinically defined  as the presence of a new infiltrate on chest imag- ing with accompanying pulmonary symptoms and fever in a patient with underlying sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome can be caused by pneumonia, infarction from in situ thrombosis, or fat embolization from bone marrow infarc- tion.4 It is important to note that acute chest syndrome can often occur in the context of a painful vaso-occlusive event, and patients some- times report pain that is worse than their typical pain, as in this case. Given the high mortality associated with acute chest syndrome, it is always an important consideration in a patient with sickle cell disease who describes atypical pain. Although this patient had leukocytosis, he had a normal chest radiograph, and his pain was fo- cused at the hip and pelvis. In addition, his re- spiratory status remained stable, without the need for supplemental oxygen. These findings make acute chest syndrome an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nVenous Thromboembolism\nThe risk of initial or recurrent venous thrombo- embolic disease among patients with sickle cell disease is higher than the risk in the general population, and up to 12% of patients with sickle cell disease have a thrombotic event be- fore 40 years of age.6 This patient described focal pain in the right hip, a finding that sug- gested the possibility of a new venous thrombo- embolism. Patients with hemoglobin SS or S\u03b20- thalassemia carry the highest risk of venous thromboembolic disease; a history of more than three hospitalizations per year, surgical splenectomy, or the presence of indwelling catheters augments the risk further.7-9 The risk of recur- rent venous thromboembolic disease in patients with sickle cell disease is as high as 25% and increases with the frequency of hospitaliza- tions.6 With underlying hemoglobin SS and a history of more than three hospitalizations with- in the year leading up to the current admission, this patient was at an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. However, he had no leg swell- ing on examination, and although the d-dimer level was elevated, patients with sickle cell dis- ease often have an elevated d-dimer level at baseline, which makes it a less specific marker of thrombosis in this patient population.10\n\nOsteonecrosis\nThe focal nature of the patient\u2019s pain suggests the possibility of osteonecrosis, a complication of sickle cell disease that can be insidious. Sickle cell disease is associated with vitamin D defi- ciency and early osteoporosis, although guide- lines regarding screening for these complica- tions in patients with sickle cell disease are lacking.11 Osteonecrosis, which results from in- farction of the bone trabeculae and marrow cells, can lead to focal severe pain that often does not resolve as quickly as the systemic pain associated with vaso-occlusive events.12 Among patients with sickle cell disease, the lifetime risk of osteonecrosis is 30 to 50%, and recurrent or untreated osteonecrosis can give rise to frac- tures, joint collapse, and osteomyelitis.12 Older age, male sex, a high BMI, leukopenia, frequent vaso-occlusive events, a history of acute chest syndrome, and hemoglobin SS disease with con- current \u03b1-thalassemia trait have all been associ- ated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis.12 This patient had a known history of osteonecro- sis of the hip, for which he had undergone hip replacement. His disease subtype, frequent vaso- occlusive events, and sex all increase his risk of recurrent osteonecrosis, as does his age in the context of his disease, given that the mean life expectancy among patients with hemoglobin SS disease is 45 to 50 years.\n\nOsteomyelitis\nOsteonecrosis is a potential precursor to the de- velopment of osteomyelitis. This patient reported that low-grade fever had developed before pre- sentation, so it was imperative to consider an infection of the bone. In patients with sickle cell disease, hyposplenism or functional asplenia can be caused by repeated episodes of splenic infarc- tion from red-cell sickling within the spleen.13 As a result, patients with sickle cell disease have increased susceptibility to infection caused by encapsulated organisms. Sickle cell disease is also associated with irregular IgG and IgM anti- body responses, defects in the alternative com- plement pathway, a reduction in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and aberrant activation of regulatory T cells, all of which are thought to contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from infection.14,15 The prevalence of osteomyeli- tis in patients with sickle cell disease is as high as 12%, and the bacteria that most commonly cause osteomyelitis are salmonella species, Staphy- lococcus aureus, and gram-negative enteric bacilli.16 Differentiating osteomyelitis from a painful vaso-occlusive event is challenging because the symptoms can be similar. In this patient, initial imaging was not suggestive of osteomyelitis, but plain radiographs have poor sensitivity and speci- ficity for the early detection of osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice because it allows for the detection of early pathologic features, including bone mar- row edema, soft-tissue collection, and cortical bone sinus tracts.16,17 In this case, the focal na- ture of the pain, the report of fever at home, and the elevated levels of inflammatory markers are suggestive of osteomyelitis or new osteonecrosis. Although the patient did not have fever in the emergency department, the report of fever at home prompted blood culture. In patients with sickle cell disease, osteomyelitis is often the re- sult of hematogenous seeding, so blood culture was an important diagnostic tool for this reason as well.18 To further investigate for osteomyelitis or new osteonecrosis, MRI of the right hip was\nalso performed.\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Osteomyelitis  or new osteonecrosis.",
    "Diagnosis": "Campylobacter fetus bacteremia and osteomyelitis.",
    "Key testing": "MRI and  blood cultures",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. E. Zachary Nussbaum: Two sets of blood cul- tures in aerobic bottles were positive after ap- proximately 48 hours of incubation. Gram\u2019s stain- ing revealed small, curved gram-negative rods. The microbiologic differential diagnosis for these morphologic findings includes campylobacter, helicobacter, and vibrio species.\nMany commonly encountered campylobacter and helicobacter species grow under microaerobic conditions.19,20 In addition, the commonly en- countered campylobacter species Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli grow when incubated at 42\u00b0C, whereas many helicobacter species are recovered after incubation at 35 to 37\u00b0C. Vibrio species are facultative anaerobes that can be isolated under standard aerobic conditions.21 To facilitate recov- ery of these organisms, specimens obtained from the positive blood-culture bottles were inoculat- ed on solid media and incubated aerobically, anaerobically, and under microaerophilic con- ditions (6.0% oxygen, 7.0% carbon dioxide, 3.5% hydrogen, and 83.5% nitrogen) at both 35\u00b0C and 42\u00b0C.\nGrowth was noted only on solid media that had been incubated under microaerobic conditions at a temperature of 35\u00b0C. Benchside biochemical testing revealed a positive oxidase reaction. To establish definitive organism identification, a bac- terial colony was evaluated by means of matrix- assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry analysis. In this case, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified the organism as C. fetus.\nUnlike other commonly encountered campy- lobacter species, C. fetus grows well at lower temperatures and is the only campylobacter spe- cies of known clinical significance that reliably grows at 25\u00b0C,19 a property that can assist in laboratory confirmation. Among patients with C. fetus bacteremia, invasive disease is relatively common. Of the C. fetus isolates identified in the microbiology laboratory of this hospital since the implementation of MALDI-TOF mass spec- trometry, 67% have been from blood-culture specimens.\nDr. Simeone: MRI of the right hip showed artifacts from total hip arthroplasty and no evidence of an acute hip abnormality. Large-field-of-view, fluid-sensitive, short-tau inversion recovery imaging of the pelvis \u2014 which is performed during all MRI examinations of the hip to rule out pelvic causes of hip pain \u2014 showed bone mar- row edema involving the right sacral ala, adja- cent to the sacroiliac joint.\nMRI of the sacrum was subsequently per- formed. Fluid-sensitive, T2-weighted, fat-saturated imaging (Fig. 2A) showed bone marrow edema involving the right sacral ala, as well as a small sacroiliac joint effusion. T1-weighted imaging (Fig. 2B) showed diffuse low signal intensity in the bone marrow, a finding consistent with red bone marrow reconversion in the context of sickle cell disease. The differential diagnosis for these bony findings was bone marrow infarction or osteomyelitis. The presence of a joint effusion could suggest septic sacroiliitis.\nFigure 2. MRIs of the Sacrum Obtained during the Current Admission and 1 Month after Discharge.\nMRI of the sacrum was performed during the current admission. A coronal fluid\u2011sensitive, T2\u2011weighted, fat\u2011saturated image (Panel A) shows right sacral bone marrow edema (arrow) and a small sacroiliac joint effusion (arrowhead).\nA coronal T1\u2011weighted image (Panel B) shows diffuse low signal intensity in the bone marrow (Panel B), a finding that can interfere with the detection of a fracture. Follow\u2011up MRI of the sacrum was performed 1 month after discharge. A coronal fluid\u2011sensitive, T2\u2011weighted, fat\u2011saturated image (Panel C) and a coronal T1\u2011weighted image (Panel D) show the development of a well\u2011defined signal abnormality with peripheral hypointensity (arrows) within the region of bone marrow edema in the right sacrum, a finding consistent with marrow infarction. The sacroiliac joint effusion has resolved.\n\n",
