    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Abigail L. Donovan: A 13-year-old boy with a history of attention deficit\u2013hyperac- tivity disorder (ADHD), borderline personality disorder, and major depressive dis- order was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of worsening depression, thoughts of self-injurious behavior, and suicidality.\nThe patient had a history of impulsivity and frequent episodes of self-injury, such as head-butting and cutting, which sometimes occurred while he was in treatment settings. Twelve months before the current presentation, he began to have suicidal ideation, with occasional suicidal planning and a suicide attempt. During the next year, the patient had 10 evaluations in the emergency department and six inpatient psychiatric hospitalizations.\nOne day before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric hospital, where he had been admitted and treated for 3 weeks because of urges to hurt himself. On the day of the current presentation, the pa- tient visited his middle school and participated in therapy at home. Throughout the day, he noticed worsening depression and had recurrent thoughts of self-injury and suicide. He asked his parents to call emergency medical services because he felt unsafe in his home. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient was in an agitated and combative state, reporting that   he had changed his mind and no longer wanted to be in the hospital. Attempts at verbal deescalation were not effective. Treatment with intramuscular olanzapine was administered, and physical restraints were placed on his arms and legs. Dur- ing the next 6 hours, the agitation decreased, and the physical restraints were removed. Additional history was obtained but was limited because the patient shrugged his shoulders in response to most questions. He described the school visit as difficult and uncomfortable. He did not indicate why he felt unsafe in his home; he reported that he had picked at scabs on his arms and legs in order to  hurt himself and had ongoing suicidal ideation. The patient also reported dif- ficulty sleeping and concentrating, as well as loss of interest and motivation,although he still enjoyed playing sports. He had no homicidal ideation, paranoid thoughts, or delusions.\nMedications included extended-release guan- facine and lurasidone. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an urban area of New Hampshire with his mother, father, and sister.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the heart rate 76 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared disheveled. There were scattered cuts and wounds in varying stages of healing on both arms. The patient was in a dis- engaged and agitated state. He had a depressed mood, a guarded affect, and difficulty concen- trating. His speech was slow and soft, with re- duced prosody. His thought process was logical and linear; the thought content was notable for suicidal ideation. He had no loosening of asso- ciations, delusions, or hallucinations. Insight and judgment were poor.\nThe patient was deemed to be at high risk for harm and was transferred to the acute psychiat- ric service of the emergency department. Trans- fer to an inpatient psychiatric hospital was requested,  but  no  beds  were  available  at any facility in the region. During the next 6 weeks, while the patient was  awaiting  admission  to an inpatient psychiatric hospital, treatment with extended-release guanfacine and lurasidone was continued, and treatment with sertraline, diphen- hydramine, and melatonin was initiated. He had frequent episodes of agitation, which led to the administration of oral clonidine or oral or intra- muscular olanzapine as needed. He also had several episodes of self-injury; surveillance was heightened, with well-being checks performed every 15 minutes.\nOn day 41 in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department, agitation developed, and a dose of oral olanzapine was administered in addition to scheduled medications. One hour later, agitation continued, and a dose of intra- muscular olanzapine was administered. After the administration of intramuscular olanzapine, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 119/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air.\nThe next morning, the blood pressure was 146/87 mm Hg and the heart rate 52 beats per minute. There were no new symptoms; the ex- amination was unchanged. Twelve hours later, the blood pressure was 69/39 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. The patient re- ported malaise and lightheadedness with stand- ing, as well as nausea and abdominal pain. He appeared pale, tired, and lethargic. Oral rehydra- tion was encouraged. One hour later, the blood pressure was 94/50 mm Hg and the heart rate 88 beats per minute. Three hours after the onset of hypotension, the blood pressure was 79/45 mm Hg and the heart rate 85 beats per minute.\nBlood and urine toxicologic screening was negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Intravenous f luids, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone were administered. Computed tomog- raphy (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. The patient was admitted to the pediatric medical service of this hospital.\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Donovan: Guanfacine overdose was suspected, and an investigation was initiated. Because the extended-release formulation of guanfacine was not on the hospital formulary, the patient\u2019s fam- ily had brought in his home supply. The bottle of guanfacine was securely stored during the pa- tient\u2019s extended stay in the acute psychiatric ser- vice of the emergency department. However, hospital policy required that the entire bottle be brought into the patient\u2019s room each time that the medication was dispensed. On hospital day 41, the bottle of guanfacine was brought into the patient\u2019s room in preparation for dispensing. However, the staff member was then urgently called out of the room, and the bottle of guan- facine was accidentally left behind. When directly questioned, the patient reported that he had ingested guanfacine from the bottle left in his room. Dr. Kevin R. Schwartz: This 13-year-old boy with ADHD, borderline personality disorder, and ma- jor depressive disorder had a prolonged stay in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency department while he was awaiting admission to an inpatient psychiatric hospital. There was a his- tory of suicidality, several episodes of self-injury, and treatment with multiple psychiatric medica- tions. On day 41 in the emergency department, transient hypertension and bradycardia developed, followed by profound hypotension and lethargy. If I were the emergency medicine physician asked to evaluate this patient, I would begin with rapid assessment and stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation. In this case, the airway was patent and the breathing unla- bored, but the circulation was markedly abnor- mal, with hypotension despite a normal heart rate for his age. The differential diagnosis for this patient\u2019s hypotension should begin with consideration of the most life-threatening possibility: decompensated shock.\nShock\nShock is defined as the failure of oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic demands of tissue. It is typically a consequence of inadequate perfusion. In children with shock, the blood pressure can remain normal because of compensatory mecha- nisms that increase the heart rate, stroke vol- ume, peripheral vascular resistance, and venous tone. Therefore, in such patients, hypotension is considered to be a late and ominous finding that is indicative of decompensated shock.1 The next step in evaluating this patient is to consider pos- sible causes of shock so that an appropriate treatment can be promptly initiated.1\n \n\nDistributive Shock\nDistributive shock occurs when vasodilation re- sults in the inappropriate distribution of blood flow. Among the causes of distributive shock, sepsis is the most likely possibility in this patient. Consensus definitions of pediatric sepsis have been established.2 However, when criteria that are less specific than the established definitions are used to identify pediatric patients who are at risk for sepsis, and when empirical treatment with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum anti- biotic therapy is administered rapidly, survival is higher.3,4 In this patient with hypotension and lethargy, sepsis was appropriately suspected, blood cultures were obtained, and treatment with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiot- ics was initiated. However, the patient had no fever, tachycardia, abnormal white-cell count, or symptoms that would be suggestive of infection, so other causes of shock must be considered.\n\nHypovolemic Shock\nHypovolemic shock, the most common cause of shock in children worldwide, is caused by deple- tion of intravascular volume. Could this patient have hypovolemic shock due to severe dehydration that developed during his prolonged stay in the acute psychiatric service of the emergency de- partment? When hypotension occurs with dehy- dration, the deficit of total body water is typically greater than 10%. This degree of volume deple- tion is usually accompanied by other findings, such as tachycardia, dry mucosa, and delayed capillary refill, none of which were present in this patient.5 Could this patient have hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage? When hypotension occurs with hemorrhage, the loss of blood volume is typically greater than 30%. This degree of blood loss can occur in six situations: internal bleed- ing in the chest, abdomen, pelvis, or retroperito- neum or around the femurs or external bleeding. The patient\u2019s abdominal pain suggests the pos- sibility of blunt abdominal trauma that has led to bleeding in the abdomen. However, CT of the abdomen, the preferred assessment in pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma, ruled out\nintraabdominal injury.6\n\nCardiogenic Shock\nCardiogenic shock is caused by inadequate car- diac output. In children, cardiogenic shock is most commonly due to myocarditis. Myocarditis is typically caused by a viral infection and may be accompanied by a prodrome, chest pain, re- spiratory distress, hepatomegaly, or tachycardia. Electrocardiographic changes are often present but can be nonspecific; troponin levels may be elevated.7\nLyme carditis could be considered in this pa- tient, given that he is from a region where Lyme disease is endemic. Lyme carditis occurs during the early disseminated phase of the disease (weeks to months after the initial infection) and is most frequently associated with atrioventricu- lar block, which can be of a high grade. It can also be associated with myopericarditis that leads to a decreased left ventricular ejection frac- tion.8 Could a combination of atrioventricular block and a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction explain this patient\u2019s hypotension with- out tachycardia? Although this possibility is un- likely, I would request that an electrocardiogram and troponin levels be obtained before consider- ing other causes.\n\nObstructive Shock\nObstruction of arterial outflow or venous inflow to the heart results in insufficient  circulation and obstructive shock. Causes include cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, and tension pneumothorax. These conditions are unlikely in this patient in the absence of accompanying tachycardia and chest pain.\n\nMedication Effect\nThis patient had an episode of hypertension and bradycardia 12 hours before hypotension devel- oped. Could there be a unifying explanation for both the transient hypertension with bradycar- dia and the subsequent persistent hypotension? Careful review of the patient\u2019s medications, with examination of side effects and possible drug interactions, would be helpful.\nSertraline, diphenhydramine, melatonin, and lurasidone alone are not known to cause hypo- tension, although lurasidone in combination with guanfacine has the potential to do so. Olanzapine has been associated with hypotension but not with relative bradycardia.9 Guanfacine and cloni- dine are both centrally acting \u03b12-adrenergic agonists that were initially developed as antihypertensive medications but are increasingly being used for the treatment of behavioral disorders, especially ADHD. Both medications have a nar- row therapeutic window, and an overdose can cause drowsiness, bradycardia, and hypoten- sion.10,11 An overdose can also result in initial peripherally acting \u03b12-adrenergic agonism, and both medications have been associated with transient hypertension that precedes sustained hypotension, which was seen in this patient.12,13 I think that this patient\u2019s hypotension \u2014 which occurred in the absence of tachycardia, fever, and clinically significant laboratory abnor- malities and was preceded by transient hyperten- sion with bradycardia \u2014 can best be explained by an ingestion of guanfacine or clonidine that led to shock from decreased sympathetic out- flow. I would ask the patient whether he had ingested additional doses of either of these medications.",
