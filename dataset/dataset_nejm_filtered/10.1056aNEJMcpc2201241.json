    "Primary Symptom": "A 25-Year-Old Woman with Headache and Blurred Vision",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Victoria Clark (Neurosurgery): A 25-year-old woman with a history of migraines was admitted to this hospital with progressively worsening headaches and photo- phobia during the previous 6 weeks and a 1-week history of nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision.\nSix weeks before this admission, the patient began to have headaches that were not characteristic of her previous migraines. She described these headaches as discomfort in the middle of her head that was associated with photophobia, phono- phobia, and tinnitus. She reported that she was occasionally awakened from sleep because of headache and that the headache was always present on awakening in the morning. The headache was worse with coughing and abated with standing; treatment with ibuprofen did not reduce the discomfort.\nOne week before admission, nausea and vomiting developed, along with blurred vision when the patient looked to the left. She also reported occasional episodes  of total vision loss that lasted for several seconds. When she was unable to eat food because of worsening nausea and vomiting, she presented to another hospital for evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed dilatation of the lat- eral and third ventricles with hypodensity that involved the dorsal brain stem and cerebellar hemispheres (Fig. 1A); a possible soft-tissue mass in the region of the fourth ventricular outlet was also observed. The patient was transferred to the emer- gency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival, the patient reported ongoing headache and nausea. Other medical history included obesity and opioid use disorder, which was treated with oral bu- prenorphine\u2013naloxone and was complicated by relapses with injection of heroin; she last injected heroin 1 month before admission. Other medications included ibupro- fen as needed. She had no known allergies. She smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily and did not drink alcohol. The patient lived in a wooded area of New England with four cats and one dog. She spent time outside, although she had become less active owing to headache. She was sexually active with one male partner and had no history of sexually transmitted infections. She had not traveled outside of New England. She had had periods of homelessness in the past, but she had not stayed in shelters. She had been incarcerated 2 years before this admission. She did not eat uncooked meat or seafood. Two paternal family members had had ovarian cancer. On examination, the patient was alert, inter- active, and did not appear to be in distress. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per min- ute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 42.6. There were track marks on the legs. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. On bedside visual field testing, she reported decreased vision in the peripheral fields and double vision on looking to the far left, which was accompa- nied by a left sixth-nerve palsy; papilledema was present in both eyes. The remainder of the crani- al-nerve examination was normal. Tests of motor strength and sensation were normal. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the complete blood count and differential count and the results of liver- and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed elevated signal hyper- intensity involving the periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain, dorsal pons, superior and middle cerebellar peduncles, dentate nuclei, and cere- bellar white matter (Fig. 1B). There was obstruc- tive hydrocephalus with transependymal flow of\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Leptomeningeal en- hancement was observed surrounding the brain stem and extending through the inferior aspect of the posterior fossa with entrapment of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 1C). There was also lepto- meningeal enhancement along multiple upper and lower cranial nerves.\nDr. Clark: Treatment with intravenous acetazol-\namide and oral dexamethasone was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the neurocritical care unit. On the first hospital day, the patient under- went stereotactically guided endoscopic explora- tion of the right ventricle. The right foramen of Monro was patent, but there was obstruction in the underlying third ventricle due to adhesions and aberrant anatomical features that precluded endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An external ventricular drain was placed; the opening pres- sure was 10 cm of water. Analysis of a CSF speci- men obtained from the external ventricular drain showed 2 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 90% were neutrophils and 10% were monocytes, and 768 red cells per microliter (reference value, 0); the CSF levels of protein and glucose were normal.\nDexamethasone therapy was discontinued, and treatment with intravenous vancomycin and cef- triaxone was initiated. Airborne precautions were instituted, and an induced sputum sample was obtained for mycobacterial culture. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on examination of smears of three sputum samples obtained sequentially, and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of one of the samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. CSF cultures were negative, and cytologic examination of the CSF did not show malignant cells.\nDr. Rohatgi: On the third hospital day, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal. On the fourth hospital day, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse leptomeningeal en- hancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (Fig. 1F).\nDr. Clark: On the fifth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed; the CSF analysis re- vealed 1120 nucleated cells, of which 77% were neutrophils, and 23 red cells. The CSF protein level was 740 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glucose level 19 mg per deciliter (1.1 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The opening pressure was 10 cm of water relative to the external auditory meatus, which was the same as the pressure that was simultaneously record- ed from the clamped external ventricular drain. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies.\nFigure 1 (facing page). Imaging Studies of the Head and Spine.\nAn axial CT image of the head (Panel A), obtained without the administration of contrast material on pre\u2011 sentation to another hospital, shows areas of hypoden\u2011 sity in the cerebellar white matter, dentate nucleus, and dorsal brain stem (long arrow), as well as hydro\u2011 cephalus with dilatation of the temporal horns (short arrow). An axial T2\u2011weighted image from MRI of the head (Panel B) that was performed after the adminis\u2011 tration of intravenous contrast material at approxi\u2011 mately the time of admission to this hospital shows elevated signal hyperintensity involving the periaque\u2011 ductal gray matter, dorsal midbrain (not shown in this view), dorsal pons (arrowhead), middle cerebellar pe\u2011 duncles, dentate nuclei, and cerebellar white matter (arrow). A sagittal T1\u2011weighted sequence from the same MRI study (Panel C), obtained after the adminis\u2011 tration of contrast material, shows narrowing and ef\u2011 facement of the fourth ventricular outlet with nodular enhancement (arrow) and enlargement and entrapment of the fourth ventricle (arrowhead). An axial T1\u2011weight\u2011 ed image from MRI of the head (Panel D) that was per\u2011 formed after the administration of intravenous con\u2011 trast material a few days after admission shows diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement surrounding the brain stem (arrow) with enhancement along the lower crani\u2011 al nerves (arrowhead). A sagittal T2\u2011weighted three\u2011 dimensional constructive interference in steady state (CISS) image from MRI of the head (Panel E) shows multiple septations within the third ventricle, including the floor (long arrows) as well as the fourth ventricular outlet (short arrow). A sagittal T1\u2011weighted image of the spine (Panel F) obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material on the fourth hospital day shows diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement, most notably in the lumbar spine, with masslike confluent enhancement filling the subarachnoid space at L5\u2013S2 (arrow).\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Christina M. Marra: This 25-year-old woman presented with a 6-week history of headache and photophobia and more recent nausea, vomiting, and double vision. Imaging studies showed hydro- cephalus and basilar leptomeningeal enhance- ment, and neurologic examination revealed a left sixth-nerve palsy. Analysis of a CSF sample ob- tained from a lumbar puncture that had been performed 5 days after admission was notable for neutrophilic pleocytosis, as well as low glucose and high protein levels. Taken together, these data suggest that she has meningitis.\n\nChronic Meningitis\nMeningitis can be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the duration of symp- toms. Patients with acute meningitis have symp- toms for up to 5 days, and those with subacute meningitis have symptoms that last for 6 to 30 days. This patient\u2019s meningitis is classified as chronic, given that her symptoms have lasted for more than 30 days. Patients in whom chronic meningitis has been diagnosed typically do not come to medical attention after having serial lum- bar punctures, but we assume that the CSF char- acteristics identified at the time of this patient\u2019s admission had been present since the onset of her symptoms. This patient\u2019s ventricular CSF pro- file was normal at admission, but this does not mean that she did not have chronic meningitis at that time. Ventricular CSF may be normal even when the lumbar CSF is abnormal, particularly in patients with basilar meningitis who have hy- drocephalus.\nChronic meningitis is uncommon, and it can\nhave many causes, including infection, autoim- mune disease, and cancer. To determine the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s chronic men- ingitis, I will focus on her medical and travel history, immune status, identification of extra- neural disease, neuroimaging characteristics, and CSF profile.\nInjection Drug Use\nThis patient is a person who injects drugs, and she was incarcerated 2 years before admission. Persons who inject drugs are at increased risk for infection with common bacterial pathogens that typically colonize the skin overlying the site of injection or infection resulting from cleaning or reusing nonsterile injection needles. However, persons who inject drugs are also at risk for tuber- culous and candida meningitis,1,2 and people who have been incarcerated are at increased risk for tuberculous meningitis.2\n\nTravel\nEndemic mycoses (coccidioidomycosis, histo- plasmosis, and blastomycosis) are well-described causes of chronic meningitis. Coccidioidomyco- sis is caused by Coccidioides immitis, which is found primarily in California and Washington, and\nC.\tposadasii, which is found primarily in the south- western United States. This patient has not trav- eled outside of New England, which makes these dimorphic fungal infections unlikely. Histoplasma capsulatum and blastomyces species, the fungi that cause histoplasmosis and blastomycosis, respec- tively, are found predominantly but not exclu- sively in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys; these fungi can also be found in New England, but this would be uncommon.\n\nImmune Status\nTo our knowledge, this patient is an immuno- logically normal host. The most common causes of chronic meningitis in immunocompetent per- sons include syphilis; infection with cryptococcus species, endemic mycoses, human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV), or varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV); systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); sarcoidosis; and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.3\nSyphilitic meningitis is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient, because the blood test for trepo- nemal antibodies was nonreactive. Treponemal antibody tests remain reactive for life in most persons who have had syphilis.4 Cryptococcal meningitis is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient, given that the blood test for cryptococcal antigen was negative.5 The patient also had a negative screening test for HIV, which makes HIV infec- tion unlikely.\nAlthough this patient is a young woman, she had no history of constitutional symptoms, arthralgias, rash, or cytopenias that would sug-\n \ngest SLE, a disease that is known to be more common among women than among men. She had no history of recurrent aphthous ulcers sug- gestive of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. There were no find- ings on CT of the chest that would suggest pulmo- nary sarcoidosis; however, meningeal sarcoidosis can occur in isolation, and although the patient\u2019s blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme was not elevated, this finding does not rule out this diagnosis.6\n\nExtraneural Disease\nThe identification of extraneural disease can help to narrow the differential diagnosis for chronic meningitis and may result in an analysis of tissue or fluid that ultimately establishes a cause. This patient had normal CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which makes leptomenin- geal metastasis unlikely. There was no radiologic evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, but this finding does not rule out a diagnosis of meningeal tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. Similarly, although three sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli and one sputum PCR test was negative for M. tuberculosis, these results do not rule out a diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.  In the United States, 21% of cases of tuberculous meningitis, including meningeal disease, are ex- trapulmonary.7\n\nNeuroimaging\nThis patient has basilar leptomeningeal enhance- ment, hydrocephalus, and brain-stem abnormali- ties. Patients with tuberculous or candida men- ingitis typically have basilar leptomeningeal enhancement, and they may have concomitant hydrocephalus. Obstructive hydrocephalus and abnormalities involving the ependyma and dorsal pons are often identified in persons with neuro- myelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).8,9 Patients with chronic VZV meningitis can have brain-stem abnormalities.3\n\nCSF Profile\nThis patient\u2019s lumbar CSF abnormalities provide an important clue to the cause of chronic men- ingitis. Despite the fact that she had had symp- toms for 6 weeks, she had neutrophilic lumbar CSF pleocytosis, with low glucose and high protein levels. Peacock and colleagues coined the term \u201cpersistent neutrophilic meningitis\u201d in a 1984 re- port,10 and in a subsequent 1990 review, Peacock simplified the definition of the syndrome, stat- ing, \u201cThe persistence of a neutrophilic leukocy- tosis over extended periods of time, the repeated failure to isolate typical bacterial pathogens on culture of CSF, and the continued survival of af- fected patients despite their purulent CSF profile identifies a unique subset of patients having an unusual chronic meningitis syndrome.\u201d11 In that review, nocardia infection was identified as the most common cause of persistent neutrophilic meningitis, followed by tuberculosis and candi- da infection. Noninfectious causes were found to be less common. Of note, NMOSD was un- known at the time of the review; patients with NMOSD and neutrophilic pleocytosis have sub- sequently been described.12\nNarrowing the Differential Diagnosis Combining clues from this patient\u2019s history, im- mune status, neuroimaging findings, and CSF profile provides a targeted group of potential noninfectious and infectious diagnoses. Sarcoidosis is unlikely because basilar enhancement is often nodular,13  and CSF pleocytosis is commonly mononuclear6; neither of these findings was seen in this patient. NMOSD and VZV infection are also unlikely because the imaging abnormalities in this patient\u2019s brain stem are probably due to hydrocephalus resulting from ventricular outflow obstruction by the inflammatory basilar exudate. Moreover, this patient would not meet the crite- ria for the diagnosis of NMOSD,14 and CSF pleo- cytosis in patients with VZV meningitis is lym- phocytic15 and not neutrophilic as in this patient. Tuberculous meningitis is also unlikely because neutrophilic CSF pleocytosis typically changes to lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis after 1 to 2 weeks of illness,11 and this patient has been symptomatic for 6 weeks with persistent neutrophilic pleocy- tosis. It is tempting to conclude that nocardia infection is the cause of this patient\u2019s chronic meningitis, given the patient\u2019s CSF profile. In ad- dition, approximately 40% of persons with cen- tral nervous system nocardiosis are immuno- competent.16 However, most patients with nocardia meningitis also have pulmonary dis- ease or brain abscess (or both)16; these were not present in this patient.\nCandida meningitis is the most likely diagno-\nsis in this case, given that this patient injects drugs, is immunocompetent, has basilar meningitis with hydrocephalus, and has persistent neu- trophilic meningitis. However, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan is a component of the cell wall of candida and other fungi,17 and the serum 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan level was not elevated. Candida meningitis occurs as a con- sequence of invasive, systemic disease or through direct inoculation of the central nervous system. The sensitivity and specificity of the serum assay for 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan for the diagnosis of candida meningitis has not been determined, but the sen- sitivity and specificity of this test for the diagno- sis of invasive candida infection are both only ap- proximately 80%.17 Thus, the negative test result does not dissuade me from making a diagnosis of candida meningitis. I suspect the diagnostic test was a CSF fungal culture.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Amelia K. Haj: The CSF specimen obtained from a lumbar puncture on hospital day 5 was submit- ted for fungal culture and a fungal wet prepara- tion. A portion of the CSF sample was also submit- ted for whole-genome sequencing. CSF evaluation at this time notably showed an elevated CSF 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan level (>500 pg per milliliter, above the limit of detection of the assay).\nThe CSF specimen was cultured on two choco- late agar slants, a blood agar plate, and a Sab- ouraud\u2019s dextrose agar plate and was inoculated into thioglycollate broth. Growth of white colo- nies was observed on only the two chocolate agar slants. Gram\u2019s staining of the colonies revealed large gram-positive cocci in clusters, consistent with yeast. A fungal wet preparation with chlora- zol black, which stains chitin blue-green, further confirmed the presence of yeast. Subculture of the thioglycollate broth on a blood agar plate showed growth of white colonies with \u201cfeet,\u201d which are characteristic of Candida albicans (Fig. 2), and subculture of the broth on a Sabouraud\u2019s dextrose agar plate, which enriches the growth of fungi, showed similar growth. MALDI-TOF (ma- trix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time-of- flight) mass spectrometry was performed on a representative colony and identified the organism as C. albicans, establishing the diagnosis of C. al- bicans meningitis. Of note, whole-genome sequenc- ing was negative.\nAntifungal susceptibility testing was performed with the use of a minimum inhibitory concen- tration assay, in which yeast growth is measured in the presence of various concentrations of anti- fungal agents. Susceptibility to fluconazole was assessed with the use of the Kirby\u2013Bauer disk- diffusion method. The C. albicans isolate from the patient\u2019s CSF was susceptible to caspofungin, fluconazole, micafungin, and voriconazole.",
