    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Theodore R. Pak (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with hypercortisolism in the context of a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.\nThe patient had been well until 4 years before this presentation, when ab- dominal pain, diarrhea, and ascites developed. A pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with metastases to the liver and spleen was ultimately diagnosed, and treatment with octreotide and everolimus was initiated.\nThree years before this presentation, treatment with peptide receptor radionu- clide therapy was initiated; four cycles were completed over the course of the next 2 years. Eight months before this presentation, the patient decided to stop taking everolimus because of fatigue.\nSeven months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated at another hospital because of weight gain, hyperglycemia, and changes in mood. She was found to have elevated blood levels of corticotropin and elevated salivary and uri- nary levels of cortisol.\nDr. Adina Haramati: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a\npituitary lesion measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension. A specimen of blood obtained from the inferior petrosal sinus identified a pituitary source of cortico- tropin secretion.\nDr. Pak: Treatment with octreotide was discontinued, and 3 months before this\npresentation, transsphenoidal resection of the pituitary lesion was performed. After the surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels remained elevated. Repeat MRI of the head revealed a residual pituitary lesion. Transsphenoidal resection of the residual lesion was performed 2 months before this presentation.\nAfter the second surgery, the cortisol and corticotropin levels decreased but did not normalize. Pathological evaluation of a resected pituitary specimen revealed normal anterior pituitary architecture that was not consistent with a corticotroph adenoma. At a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic after the patient was discharged, the 24-hour urinary free corti- sol level was again elevated, and treatment with pasireotide was initiated.\nTen days before this presentation, the patient began to have confusion, urinary incontinence, and recurrent falls. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Her husband noted atypical impulsive behaviors, such as online shopping and excessive eating.\nDr. Haramati: MRI of the head revealed a small\nfocus of decreased enhancement within the left inferior aspect of the sella turcica, a finding that was consistent with postsurgical changes or re- sidual adenoma.\nDr. Pak:  A morning blood level of cortisol was\n80 \u03bcg per deciliter (2207 nmol per liter; reference range, 4 to 23 \u03bcg per deciliter [110 to 635 nmol per liter]), and the blood level of corticotropin was 519 pg per milliliter (114 pmol per liter; reference range, 7.2  to 63 pg per milliliter [1.6 to\n14 pmol per liter]). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level was 9450 \u03bcg (26,069 nmol per liter; reference range, 3.5 to 45 \u03bcg [10 to 124 nmol per liter]).\nDr. Haramati: MRI of the abdomen revealed an exophytic mass on the pancreatic tail that broad- ly abutted the left adrenal gland, thickening of both adrenal glands, retroperitoneal metastases on the left side, and extensive hepatic metastases with chronic cavernous transformation of the portal vein.\nDr. Pak:  Treatment  with pasireotide was discontinued, and treatment with ketoconazole was initiated, in addition to potassium supplementa- tion and spironolactone for hypokalemia. On the tenth day at the other hospital, the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment. On evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported fatigue but no fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. She had no cough, hemop- tysis, or chest pain; no rheumatologic symp- toms; and no history of dysphagia or gastro- esophageal reflux disease. Her medical history included asthma and portal-vein thrombosis complicated by ascites, as well as hypothyroid- ism and central diabetes insipidus after she had undergone transsphenoidal resection of the pitu- itary lesions. Medications included atovaquone, cholecalciferol, desmopressin, ketoconazole, levo- thyroxine, metformin, pantoprazole, spironolac- tone, and potassium chloride. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol or use tobacco or vaping products; she smoked mari- juana occasionally. She lived with her husband  in Vermont and had previously worked in a health care facility. The patient reported that she had had several skin tests for Mycobacterium tuberculo- sis owing to her work in the health care setting, and none had been positive. Before her illness, she had frequently gardened and hiked locally. She had traveled to Canada but otherwise had not traveled outside New England. A paternal aunt had had ovarian cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/87 mm Hg, the pulse 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was\n24.0. The patient was alert and oriented and answered questions appropriately. Her face was rounded, and acne and hair thinning were pres- ent. The abdomen had increased adiposity and palpable striae. There were several bruises on her arms and legs. A chest radiograph obtained on admission to this hospital showed an im- planted venous access device and a patchy opac- ity in the right upper lung zone.\nTreatment with octreotide was reinitiated, and treatment with the other medications that the patient had been receiving was continued. The hypercortisolism was thought to be due to secre- tion of corticotropin from the metastatic pancre- atic neuroendocrine tumor. Bilateral adrenalec- tomy was planned, but on the second hospital day, the patient became withdrawn and would not speak, take any oral medications, or con- sume any food. She was transferred to the inten- sive care unit, and an etomidate infusion was initiated; the dose was adjusted to attain a blood level of cortisol between 10 and 20 \u03bcg per deci- liter. Subsequent treatment with intravenous lora- zepam resulted in marked improvement in the patient\u2019s mental status such that she was follow- ing commands and responding appropriately to questions. On the sixth hospital day, bilateral adrenalectomy was performed. Treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone was initiated post- operatively, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was transferred to the medicine unit of this hospital for further care.\nDr. Haramati: On the eighth hospital day, sinus tachycardia  developed.  Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material accord- ing to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Fig. 1), revealed a patchy consolidation in the right up- per lobe with areas of cavitation and adjacent tree-in-bud opacities, as well as small bilateral pleural effusions. There was no evidence of pul- monary embolism. Although previous imaging was not available for review, clinical notes indi- cated that positron-emission tomography\u2013CT performed at another hospital 8 months before this presentation had revealed a new cavitary nodule in the right upper lobe that measured 7 mm in diameter.\nDr. Pak: A sputum culture showed few squamous epithelial cells, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with no specific type predominating; no acid-fast bacilli were  observed  on a mycobacterial smear of an induced sputum sample. Urine tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens were negative, as was a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31  pg per milliliter (reference value,  <60),  and  the blood galactomannan index was 0.05 (reference range, 0 to 0.49). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nOn the ninth hospital day, bronchoscopy was performed; bronchial washings and bronchoal- veolar-lavage (BAL) samples were obtained, and no purulent secretions were observed. Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL fluid revealed few mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, and no organisms were seen on an acid-fast bacilli smear or on a modified acid-fast bacilli smear. Examination of the BAL fluid for Pneumocystis jirovecii was negative.\nOn the 11th hospital day, culture of the BAL fluid showed growth of few methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus organisms. Treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni- dazole was initiated. On the 12th hospital day, a urine test for histoplasma antigen was positive, at a level of 2.25 ng per milliliter (reference ranges, 0.00 to 0.10 [negative]; 0.11 to 1.10 [in- determinate]; \u22651.11 [positive]).\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Daniel Restrepo: This 34-year-old woman with a metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, complicated by ectopic corticotropin secretion and hypercortisolism, presents with progressive pulmonary findings on cross-sectional imaging. Although she has a complex history and is pre- senting with large amounts of clinical data, I will first focus on specific features of this patient\u2019s presentation and attempt to eliminate some of the extraneous information to efficiently reach a diagnosis.\nProblem Representation \u2014 Signal versus Noise\nWhen clinicians are confronted with a complex case, they are often tasked with sorting out sa- lient features contained within large amounts of data, whether from the patient during the en- counter or by way of medical record review. The first step in developing a differential diagnosis  in this case is to differentiate \u201csignal\u201d from \u201cnoise.\u201d This patient\u2019s medical history is notable for a rare tumor that is manifested by a rare complication and for which she has received multiple lines of therapy. Her treatment includes immunomodulators and somatostatin analogues, and her tumor has led to additional conditions,including noncirrhotic portal hypertension resulting from portal-vein thrombosis. However, our first task is to consider possible causes of  the pulmonary imaging findings in the context of large amounts of endogenous glucocorticoids being produced in the presence of a corticotro- pin-secreting neuroendocrine tumor. Owing to this patient\u2019s hypercortisolemia, she can be con- sidered to be immunocompromised.\nThe creation of a problem representation in- volves the distillation of salient data from a pa- tient\u2019s narrative into a brief statement that summarizes the clinical problem at hand.1 Typically, a problem representation includes information that characterizes the patient, such as epidemio- logic risk factors for certain diseases, as well as the tempo of the disease process and the pre- senting clinical syndrome.2 On the basis of the information provided in this case, I would con- struct the problem representation as follows: a 34-year-old woman with a compromised im- mune system due to prolonged hypercortisolism who now presents with chronic insidious and progressive tree-in-bud opacities and cavitary lung lesions. By creating a problem representa- tion, we can frame the approach to this case and narrow our differential diagnosis on the basis of the patient\u2019s imaging findings.\n\nPivot Points \u2014 Cavitary Lung Lesions and Tree-in-Bud Opacities\nA pivot point is defined as a facet of a case that has a limited differential diagnosis on which a diagnostician can focus to reach a diagnosis.3 Pivot points can be very useful in cases with extensive clinical data because they function to minimize cognitive load and lessen the number of diagnostic possibilities. I have chosen this patient\u2019s cavitary lung lesions and tree-in-bud opacities as two pivot points for this case.\nCavitary lung lesions are solid lesions with gas-filled cavities, consolidations, or masses in the lung that can be seen on imaging studies  and are caused by a variety of processes. Non- infectious causes can be divided largely into autoimmune disease and cancer. Autoimmune diseases associated with pulmonary cavitation include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sar- coidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Both primary lung tumors and metastatic cancer can cause cavitary lung lesions and are an important diag- nostic consideration. However, the majority of cavitary lung lesions are caused by infections, and the list of potential pathogens is extensive, especially in immunocompromised hosts.4\nTree-in-bud opacities, which can be seen on CT imaging, result from inflammation or im- paction in the distal bronchioles of the lung and should not be present in healthy lungs. These opacities are named for their pattern of clustered nodules around a central bronchiole, which re- sembles tree branches surrounded by budding leaves. Tree-in-bud opacities are frequently caused\n \nby infection or aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents; however, in rare cases, these opacities can also occur with certain autoim- mune diseases, such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis with pulmonary involve- ment. Infectious causes of the opacities include both tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobac- terial infections, fungal infections, and infec- tions caused by common bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus and Haemophilus inf luenzae.5\n\nSequential Venn Diagrams\nDespite the use of these two pivot points, the differential diagnosis remains broad. As  such, we will need to implement another cognitive strategy \u2014 the construction of a Venn diagram\n\u2014 to help narrow the list of possible diagnoses. Venn diagrams are commonly used to highlight features shared among different sets of informa- tion. In clinical reasoning, they allow us to rule out diagnoses that are not associated with the features that appear in the overlapping regions  of the diagram.\nIf we consider diagnoses that are manifested by both tree-in-bud opacities and cavitary lesions in the lung, we can rule out cancer and are left with infectious or  autoimmune  processes (Fig. 2). If we add a third circle to our Venn dia- gram that denotes this patient\u2019s compromised immune system, the overlapping areas can help us to further narrow the differential diagnosis  to an infectious process. This Venn diagram also enables us to focus solely on infections that cause both tree-in-bud opacities and cavitation.\n\nBacterial Infection\nDespite the fact that S. aureus was isolated from this patient\u2019s respiratory samples and that it can be associated with both imaging patterns, the persistence of the imaging findings combined with the absence of symptoms in this patient provide strong evidence that S. aureus is not the causative pathogen in this case. Although acti- nomyces or nocardia could be compatible with this patient\u2019s presentation, microbiologic testing was negative, which makes both typical and atypical bacterial infections unlikely.\n\nMycobacterial Infection\nBoth tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobac- teria can result in pulmonary imaging findings compatible with those seen in this patient and are present disproportionately in immunocom- promised hosts; thus, infection from these pathogens is difficult to rule out. Because she has worked in health care facilities, she has had several tuberculin skin tests performed, and we are told that all were negative, although these tests can be falsely negative in patients with im- munocompromise. Perhaps the most important pieces of evidence to consider with respect to the possibility of a mycobacterial infection are that an induced sputum sample and BAL specimens obtained during bronchoscopy were negative for acid-fast bacilli. In the presence of cavitary dis- ease, the diagnostic yield of such samples is higher than that in patients without cavitary lung lesions owing to the high amount of inocu- lum of organisms and the fact that lesions are often contiguous with the airway.6 Thus, given the absence of acid-fast bacilli on staining of her respiratory specimens, this patient\u2019s infection is unlikely to be caused by mycobacteria.\nFungal Infection\nWe are told that this patient enjoys gardening and that she occasionally smokes marijuana, which allow us to add another circle to our se- quential Venn diagrams. The overlapping areas will lead us to the diagnosis. Both exposures place her at risk for inhalation of fungi. Thus, when considering the entirety of the case, I am most concerned about an invasive fungal infec- tion \u2014 specifically aspergillosis, histoplasmo- sis, or blastomycosis. We can use her epidemio- logic risk factors and the diagnostic test results provided to reach a diagnosis.\nAspergillus is a ubiquitous mold that most commonly affects immunocompromised hosts. Aspergillosis causes a variety of clinical syn- dromes ranging from allergy to direct invasion of blood vessels; if it enters the lungs, it can cause hemoptysis and respiratory failure. Com- bustion of cannabis has been associated with pulmonary aspergillosis.7 Although aspergillosis can be seen in patients receiving long-term glu- cocorticoid therapy, the presence of prolonged neutropenia confers the highest risk of invasive disease. A definitive diagnosis of aspergillosis is established by culturing the organism or by di- rect visualization of the mold in a biopsy speci- men or a respiratory specimen. Testing of BAL fluid or blood for the presence of galactoman- nan, a component of the fungal cell wall, is of- ten a useful surrogate marker of aspergillus in- fection, provided that the limitations of the test are considered when interpreting the result. This patient did not have neutropenia and had a negative blood galactomannan test, which make the diagnosis of aspergillosis unlikely in this case.\nThis patient had a positive urine test for histoplasma antigen. Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Histo- plasma capsulatum. Although this organism is endemic in the Ohio and Mississippi River Val- leys, it can also be found in the eastern United States, Texas, and Central and South America. Primary infection with histoplasma is often as- ymptomatic, although it can be manifested by a pneumonic syndrome with extrapulmonary fea- tures. It is important to note that the urine test for histoplasma antigen has cross-reactivity with other dimorphic fungi, which makes this anti- gen a sensitive but not specific marker of acute and disseminated infection.8 This patient\u2019s clini- cal presentation, imaging findings, and positive urine test for histoplasma antigen are all consis- tent with the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. How- ever, histoplasma produces 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan,9 a component of the fungal cell wall, and measure- ment of the blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan is often used as a marker of invasive fungal infection. This patient had an undetectable blood 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan level, which makes a diagnosis of histoplasmosis less likely.\nBlastomycosis is an endemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomyces shares many clinical features with histoplasma, although its distribution in North America is more concentrated along the east coast of the United States, spanning upward to- ward Canada. Unlike histoplasma, blastomyces does not produce 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan in its  cell  wall,10 a feature that is consistent with this pa- tient\u2019s test result. Furthermore, there is known cross-reactivity between urine tests for histo- plasma and blastomyces antigens, which could account for this patient\u2019s positive histoplasma antigen test. Coupled with  her  epidemiologic risk factors, including soil exposure in Vermont and Canada, I suspect that she has blastomyco- sis. To  establish the diagnosis of blastomycosis, I would await maturation of the fungal cultures; if they are negative, I would pursue transbron- chial biopsy of the cavitary lesions for fungal staining and culture.",
