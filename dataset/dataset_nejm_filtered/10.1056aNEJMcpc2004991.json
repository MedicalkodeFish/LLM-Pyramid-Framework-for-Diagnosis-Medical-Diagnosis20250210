    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Margaret B. Allison (Medicine): A 52-year-old man was urgently evaluated because of hypoxemia that occurred on the fifth day he was at this hospital for suspected cancer.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 months before presen- tation to this hospital, when pain on the right side of the back developed. The pain began gradually after the patient had moved heavy furniture, worsened with activ- ity and coughing, sometimes radiated down the back of the right arm to the elbow, and occasionally awakened him from sleep. During the next 2 months, the pain waxed and waned. Ice, ibuprofen, naproxen, cyclobenzaprine, and physical therapy were prescribed but did not lead to any improvement.\nOne day before presentation to this hospital, the patient was seen in his pri- mary care clinic because the severity of the back pain had increased and numbness and weakness of the right hand had developed. Radiography of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed spondylolisthesis, degenerative changes, and an anterior wedge deformity of the T9 vertebral body of indeterminate duration. The following day, after the imaging results were reviewed, the patient was referred to the emer- gency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported severe, sharp, burning pain in the right shoulder, triceps, and upper and middle back. He also noted fatigue and increased urinary frequency. He had hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and hyperthyroidism. Medications included amlodipine, metoprolol, topiramate, raniti- dine, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Peanuts and latex had caused urticaria. Multiple relatives had hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The patient worked in security and did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit substances. He identified as Black and as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness; he stated that receiving blood transfusions was incompat- ible with his beliefs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 162/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The paraspinal muscles were tender, more so on the right side than on the left side. Strength was 4 out of 5 when the patient extended his right shoulder and when he gripped the exam- iner\u2019s fingers with his right hand. Straight leg raising was normal bilaterally. Oral acetamino- phen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and diazepam and transdermal lidocaine were administered, and the patient was observed overnight in the emer- gency department. The next morning, the pain persisted; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed.\nDr. F. Joseph Simeone: MRI of the spine (Fig. 1A,1B, and 1C), performed before and after the ad- ministration of intravenous gadolinium, revealed an enhancing, marrow-replacing mass involving the right posterior aspect of the T1 vertebral body, with resultant severe stenosis of the spinal canal and right neural foramen. The bone mar- row signal was diffusely heterogeneous, and there were mild compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies, including T9, as seen on radiography.\nDr. Allison: The blood calcium level was 19.7 mg per deciliter (4.92 mmol per liter; reference range,8.5\tto 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter]). The anion gap, platelet count, erythro- cyte sedimentation rate, and urinalysis were normal, as were blood levels of magnesium, ala- nine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer- ase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, thyro- tropin, and prostate-specific antigen; other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Serum and urine samples were obtained for protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, and another serum sample was obtained to be analyzed for kappa and lambda free light chains. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Simeone: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1D), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the lytic lesion at T1 and the compression deformities of multiple thoracic vertebral bodies. Multiple small osteolytic skeletal lesions were identified. There was no evidence of other mass lesions or lymphadenopathy.\n \nDr. Allison: The patient was admitted to the hospital on the second hospital day; a diagnosis of cancer was suspected. On examination, he appeared fatigued and uncomfortable and had a flat affect. There was diminished sensation of the pads of the second and third fingers on the right hand; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Oral acetaminophen, subcuta- neous calcitonin, and intravenous lactated Ring- er\u2019s solution, hydromorphone, diazepam, and zoledronic acid were administered. Overnight, the patient became increasingly somnolent, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 91%.\nThe following morning, on the third hospital day, auscultation of the lungs revealed bibasilar crackles. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and zoledronic acid were stopped, and intravenous normal saline, furosemide, and dexamethasone were begun.\nOn the fourth hospital day, a CT-guided bone marrow biopsy was performed. Afterward, trace edema in the legs was noted. Examination of the urinary sediment revealed barrel-shaped crys- tals, and a 24-hour urine sample contained more than 5 g of protein; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A stool sample was guaiac- negative. Oral cholecalciferol and intravenous rasburicase were administered.\nEarly the following morning, on the fifth hospital day, the oxygen saturation decreased to 86%, without shortness of breath. The rate of supplemental oxygen administration was increased to 6 liters per minute, but the oxygen saturation did not increase. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Auscultation of the heart and lungs was normal. Furosemide was admin- istered intravenously, and chest radiography was performed.\nDr. Simeone: An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest showed low lung volumes and other- wise clear lungs (Fig. 1E).\nDr. Allison: Two hours later, high-flow oxygen therapy was administered through a nasal can- nula (rate, 60 liters per minute; fraction of in- spired oxygen [Fio2], 1.0); the oxygen saturation remained unchanged. Blood levels of lactate, troponin T, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page). Imaging Studies.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was performed on the second hos\u00ad pital day. A sagittal T2\u00adweighted image of the cervical spine (Panel A), a sagittal T1\u00adweighted image of the thoracic spine with fat saturation obtained after the ad\u00ad ministration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel B), and an axial T1\u00adweighted image of the T1 vertebral body ob\u00ad tained after the administration of intravenous gadolinium (Panel C) show a marrow\u00adreplacing, destructive lesion involving the T1 vertebral body and posterior elements (white arrows). The bone marrow signal is diffusely hetero\u00ad geneous, and multiple thoracic vertebral bodies show superior end\u00adplate compression deformities (Panel B, black arrows). There is severe spinal stenosis and left\u00ad ward displacement of the spinal cord (Panel C, arrow\u00ad head) resulting from epidural extension of the mass.\nComputed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed on the third hospital day. A coned\u00addown sagittal image of the thoracic spine obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel D) shows the destructive lesion involving the T1 vertebral body (white arrow), partial superior end\u00adplate collapse of multiple vertebral bodies (black arrows), and diffuse small, round lytic lesions in multiple vertebral bodies and the sternum (arrowheads), as well as incidental hepatic steatosis (asterisk). Chest radiography was performed on the fifth hospital day, on the day of the current evaluation. The radiograph (Panel E) shows low lung volumes but otherwise clear lungs.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lucas X. Marinacci: This 52-year-old man with back pain was admitted to the hospital after a vertebral mass, multiple lytic bone lesions, and severe hypercalcemia were identified and a diag- nosis of cancer was suspected. On the fifth hospital day, the oxygen saturation measured by means of pulse oximetry decreased precipitous- ly. I was a member of the team that evaluated this patient during this acute episode, and I am aware of the final diagnosis.\nCauses of hypoxemia are typically classified according to the underlying mechanism: de- creased Fio2, hypoventilation, impaired diffusion, ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, and shunting.\nThis framework is useful for understanding the pathophysiology, but for two reasons it is often not helpful in the initial evaluation of a patient with acute hypoxemia. First, most possible causes fall into the last two categories. Second, categorization requires knowledge of the differ- ence between the alveolar and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, known as the alveolar\u2013arte- rial gradient, a value that is usually not immedi- ately available to the clinician.1 At the bedside, a step-by-step approach that rapidly identifies findings that alter immediate management and narrows the differential diagnosis is more prac- tical (Fig. 2).\n\nHypoxemia\nThe first step in the evaluation and treatment of this patient with an acute decrease in oxygen saturation is to determine whether a higher level of care or ventilatory support is needed. Can the patient protect his airway, with intact awareness, reflexes, coordination, and strength to maintain airway patency despite potential or impending obstruction, such as by secretions, vomitus, tis- sue edema, blood, or a foreign body? Does he have rapidly progressive respiratory fatigue or an increasing oxygen requirement? Does he have an underlying condition, such as severe obstructive lung disease or diffuse parenchymal lung dis- ease, or does he have impaired respiratory me- chanics due to massive ascites or neuromuscular weakness \u2014 conditions that could be limiting his physiologic reserve?\nThe patient appeared well and had no preexisting respiratory vulnerability. A caveat to this assessment is that the skin pigmentation may have limited the detection of cyanosis, which can be subtle in patients with dark skin.2 In such patients, special attention should be paid to the mucous membranes, including the gums, lips, and conjunctivae, where a grayish hue may be present in a cyanotic state.3\nThe next steps are to evaluate for signs of up- per airway obstruction \u2014 such as stridor, lip or tongue swelling, or the inability to handle secre- tions \u2014 and to assess the thorax by means of physical examination, bedside chest radiography, and point-of-care ultrasonography, if available. This patient had no signs of upper airway ob- struction, and he had a normal lung examina- tion and an unremarkable chest radiograph; these findings make primary parenchymal or pleural disease unlikely.\nLow Oxygen Saturation and Clear Lungs\nNow that several possible causes of this patient\u2019s hypoxemia have been rapidly ruled out, the problem representation can be distilled to a patient with low oxygen saturation in the context of clear lung fields. The differential diagnosis can then be further narrowed on the basis of the results of two bedside diagnostic maneuvers: increasing the Fio2 and performing arterial blood gas analysis. Increasing the Fio2 did not affect the patient\u2019s readings on pulse oximetry, which were strikingly invariable at 86%. The arterial blood gas measurements are shown in Table 1.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\nCould this patient have pulmonary embolism? He is at an elevated risk because of immobiliza- tion due to pathological fracture, suspected can- cer, and inpatient status; the last two factors make clinical decision rules less useful and ren- der the elevated D-dimer level nonspecific.4,5 The patient has anemia, and blood transfusions are incompatible with his religious beliefs; these features increase the risk of harm associated with the empirical initiation of anticoagulation. In addition, he has acute kidney injury, and CT pulmonary angiography is associated with a risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Ventilation\u2013 perfusion scanning is not available on an emer- gency basis, and the level of supplemental oxy- gen being administered would preclude a ventilation\u2013perfusion scan at this hospital. The absence of hypotension, tachycardia, and a change in oxygen saturation in response to increasing the Fio2 argues against, but by no means rules out, venous thromboembolism.6 Given the poten- tial harms associated with workup and treat- ment and the uncertainty surrounding the di- agnosis, it is reasonable to keep pulmonary embolism on the differential diagnosis while pursuing other possible causes.\n\nHypoventilation\nHypoventilation is usually clinically apparent on the basis of a low respiratory rate or tidal vol- ume. Furthermore, hypoxemia caused by hypo- ventilation would abate with the administration of supplemental oxygen and would be associated with a normal alveolar\u2013arterial gradient, and neither of these features was observed in this patient.\n\nOxygen Saturation Gap\nThe next step in the evaluation of this patient\u2019s hypoxemia is to determine whether there is an oxygen saturation gap, defined as a difference of more than 5 percentage points between the oxy- gen saturation obtained by means of pulse oxim- etry (Spo2) and the oxygen saturation obtained by means of arterial blood gas analysis (Sao2).7 In this case, the Spo2 was 86% and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was 200 mm Hg, which on a standard oxygen\u2013hemoglobin disso- ciation curve with a temperature of 37\u00b0C and a pH of 7.4 correlates with an Sao2 of 99.2%; the Sao2 is often reported by the laboratory along- side the arterial blood gas results.8 Therefore, an oxygen saturation gap is present.\nShunting\nIn the presence of a right-to-left shunt, hypox- emia is caused by blood that does not participate in gas exchange before entering the systemic circulation. Massive atelectasis or processes that lead to alveolar filling, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, can cause shunting. However, the differential diagnosis of intrapulmonary shunts in the context of clear lungs is limited to conditions associated with anomalous arteriove-\n \n\nnous connections, which can be physiological, resulting from vasodilation, as in hepatopulmo- nary syndrome, or can be anatomical, resulting from arteriovenous malformations, as in heredi- tary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. However, this patient has no evidence of either of these condi- tions, and neither would manifest so acutely.\nAn acute intracardiac right-to-left shunt in an adult without known structural heart disease can occur when there is a previously unrecog- nized defect, such as a patent foramen ovale, and a cause of newly elevated pressures on the right side of the heart, such as a pulmonary embolism.9 In this case, there is no reason to suspect elevated pulmonary vascular resistance from underlying lung disease or preexisting pulmonary hypertension. In the absence of markedly elevated pressure gradients, transient intracardiac right-to-left shunt can be due to interatrial anatomical shunt.10 However, these processes would not cause an oxygen saturation gap, since they are not associated with factors that interfere with the measurement of either Spo2 or Sao2.\nArtifact\nPulse oximetry involves shining two wavelengths of light, red and infrared, through peripheral tissue that has a pulsating vascular bed, such as the fingertip or earlobe. The two major forms of hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemo- globin, absorb light differently at these two wavelengths; deoxyhemoglobin absorbs more red light, and oxyhemoglobin absorbs more infrared light. Measurement of the changes in light ab- sorption over each cardiac cycle allows for gen- eration of a ratio (R) of red light to infrared light absorbed by the arterial compartment. This di- mensionless ratio, effectively representing the ratio of deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin, is converted into an oxygen saturation measure- ment with the use of a calibrated curve that has been empirically derived from ratios in healthy volunteers with experimentally induced, inde- pendently verified oxygen saturations between 100% and 70%.11\nIf a patient lacks sufficient pulsatile flow at\nthe measurement point, whether because of vaso- constriction or poor perfusion, the Spo2 may be inaccurate. In addition, the administration of medical dyes that absorb red or infrared light, such as methylene blue, indocyanine green, or indigo carmine, can interfere with Spo2 measure- ments and cause an oxygen saturation gap.12\nThis patient\u2019s hands were well perfused, and no dyes had been administered; therefore, artifac- tual results on pulse oximetry can be ruled out.\n\nDyshemoglobinemia\nThree abnormal hemoglobin variants \u2014 carboxy- hemoglobin, sulfhemoglobin, and methemoglo- bin \u2014 absorb both red and infrared light, inter- fering with Spo2 measurements and leading to an oxygen saturation gap.7 Carboxyhemoglo- binemia requires exposure to carbon monoxide, which is highly unlikely to occur in the hospital. Sulfhemoglobinemia can be caused by exposure to hydrogenated sulfide in chemicals such as cleaning solutions and, in rare cases, can be a side effect of certain medications, including metoclopramide, sulfonamides, nitrates, and dapsone, many of which would also cause met- hemoglobinemia. This patient had no known exposure to any of these agents, but he had re- ceived rasburicase, a medication that is known to cause methemoglobinemia, particularly in the context of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.\n\nMethemoglobinemia and G6PD Deficiency Although methemoglobinemia can develop after the administration of rasburicase in patients with- out G6PD deficiency, G6PD-deficient patients are at an elevated risk for both hemolysis and methemoglobinemia resulting from the use of this drug. As such, the Food and Drug Adminis- tration recommends that G6PD levels be mea-\nsured before the administration of rasburicase.13 The prevalence of G6PD deficiency is high among Black men.14 Furthermore, the administration of methylene blue in patients with G6PD deficiency can induce hemolysis and paradoxically worsen methemoglobinemia.15 Therefore, after my colleagues and I evaluated this patient, we consid- ered rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia in the context of G6PD deficiency to be the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Grace K. Mahowald: Oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhe- moglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and methemo- globin have characteristic absorbance spectra, and their concentrations can be measured on most blood gas instruments with the use of CO-oxim- etry. After absorbance is measured at various wavelengths of light, the concentrations of these hemoglobin derivatives can be determined with the use of the Beer\u2013Lambert law; the sum of their concentrations equals the total hemoglo- bin concentration.\nMethemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin in which heme iron is oxidized from the ferrous state to the ferric state and is unable to bind oxygen; in addition, the remaining subunits of hemoglobin bind oxygen more tightly, shifting the oxygen\u2013hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left and further decreasing oxygen delivery to tissues. In this patient, the methemoglobin con- centration measured in the sample submitted for arterial blood gas analysis on the fifth hospital day was found to be elevated, accounting for 7.4% (reference range, 0.0 to 1.5) of the total hemoglobin concentration.\nDr. David J. Kuter: Examination of a peripheral-\nblood smear (Fig. 3) revealed numerous \u201cbite cells,\u201d which are formed when oxidized hemo- globin precipitates within red cells and a portion of the cell is removed (\u201cbitten off\u201d) by the spleen, eventually resulting in clearance of the entire red cell. A correlated finding on histo- chemical staining is the presence of Heinz bod- ies.16 The most common cause of bite cells is G6PD deficiency.\nDr. Mahowald: Testing for G6PD activity is per- formed by means of spectrophotometric measure- ment of NADPH production in red cells when glucose 6-phosphate is provided as a substrate. In this patient, the level was 0.6 U per gram of hemoglobin (reference range, 8.8 to 13.4), con- firming the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency. In hindsight, the patient\u2019s G6PD level should have been checked before the administration of ras- buricase \u2014 a central teaching point in this case. Dr. Kuter: Red-cell hemoglobin is continually subjected to oxidative stress from exposure to high oxygen concentrations and other oxidants. To mitigate the effects of oxidative stress on the iron and protein constituents of hemoglobin, reducing mechanisms have evolved in red cells (Fig. 4A). G6PD is integral to these reducing mechanisms because it generates NADPH (Fig. 4B), which supports two major antioxidant func- tions. First, NADPH produces glutathione, the major reducing agent in red cells. Glutathione directly inactivates oxidant molecules such as hydrogen peroxide and reverses oxidative dam- age to hemoglobin protein. In response to oxida- tive stress, G6PD can markedly increase the production of glutathione, but this response is diminished in red cells deficient in G6PD.17,18 Second, NADPH is necessary for the function of NADPH methemoglobin reductase, an enzyme that accounts for approximately 6% of total met- hemoglobin reduction activity. This enzyme also reduces methylene blue to leukomethylene blue, which serves as an electron donor in the non- enzymatic conversion of ferric iron to ferrous iron; this is the primary mechanism by which methylene blue reduces methemoglobin. Because of the important roles served by G6PD in these antioxidant processes, G6PD deficiency can both modestly increase the severity of methemoglo- binemia and limit the ability of methylene blue to treat methemoglobinemia.19,20\nG6PD deficiency is clinically heterogeneous, and the World Health Organization has created a useful classification scheme.21 Class III G6PD deficiency, which was present in this patient, is associated with an enzyme half-life of 13 days, enzyme activity that is typically 10 to 60% of the normal level, and intermittent hemolysis; stimu- li known to precipitate hemolytic attacks include infection, foods, hypoxemia, inflammation, and certain drugs with high oxidative potential. One such drug is rasburicase, which was adminis- tered in this patient. Rasburicase converts uric acid to allantoin and large amounts of hydrogen peroxide. In patients with G6PD deficiency, the oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide increas- es iron and protein oxidation, resulting in met- hemoglobinemia and hemolysis.\n",
