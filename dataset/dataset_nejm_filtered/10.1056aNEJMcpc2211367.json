    "Primary Symptom": "A  16-Year-Old  Girl with Abdominal Pain and Bloody Diarrhea",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Erin E. Mauney (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital be- cause of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 5 weeks before this admission, when diarrhea and intermittent, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain developed. During the subse- quent week, the diarrhea occurred more frequently, and the abdominal pain wors- ened in severity, such that it sometimes awoke the patient from sleep. Four weeks before this admission, the diarrhea began to contain dark-red blood. The patient\u2019s mother took her to the primary care clinic of another hospital.\nIn the primary care clinic, the weight was 98.7  kg;  the physical examination  was otherwise normal. The hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were negative, as were antigen tests for giardia, cryptospo- ridium, and Clostridioides difficile toxin. Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, the patient completed the course of ciprofloxacin as instructed, but the abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea continued. On the day of this admission, diarrhea occurred at least four times. The patient\u2019s parents called the primary care clinic and were instructed to bring her to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fatigue, malaise, weight loss, decreased ap- petite, and intermittent nausea and vomiting when she ate food. She also had headache and mild, diffuse joint and muscle pain. She had had no fever or sick contacts.\nThe patient had obesity, anxiety, and attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Medications included fluoxetine and dextroamphetamine\u2013amphetamine; there were no known drug allergies. Menarche had occurred when she was 11 years of age, and her last menstrual period had been 2 months earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke tobacco. The  patient lived in a rural area of New England with her mother, father, and sister, as well as her pet dog, cat, and lizard. She attended a technical high school with an emphasis on agriculture, and she had frequent interactions with marine and farm animals through school. Her family history included colorectal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in her mater- nal grandfather, diverticulosis in her maternal grandmother and mother, psoriasis in her ma- ternal grandmother and uncle, and celiac disease in her paternal cousin. Her father had hyperlipi- demia, and her mother had had one miscarriage, which had occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 94/68 mm Hg. The weight was 89.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.7. The patient appeared pale, tired, and uncomfortable because of pain. The mucous membranes were dry. The abdomen was nondistended, and there was mild tenderness in both lower quadrants. There was no ulceration or rash.\nThe white-cell count was 10,690 per microli- ter (reference range in children 12 to 17 years of age, 4500 to 10,700), the platelet count 188,000 per microliter, and the hemoglobin level 9.8 g per deciliter. The blood level of C-reactive protein was 248.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 71 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). The blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing for severe acute respiratory syn- drome coronavirus 2 was negative. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ondansetron were administered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level was\n8.2 g per deciliter, and one unit of packed red cells was transfused. Esophagogastroduodenos- copy (EGD) and colonoscopy were performed.\nDr. Maureen M. Leonard: On EGD, two cratered\nesophageal ulcers were located 30 cm from the incisors (Fig. 1A). The proximal, middle, and distal portions of the esophagus were normal. Diffuse mild inflammation \u2014 characterized by erythema and friability \u2014 was found in the cardia, gastric fundus, and gastric antrum (Fig. 1B). The duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy speci- mens were obtained throughout the procedure for histologic evaluation.\nWhen the patient was being positioned on the procedure table for the colonoscopy, a large vol- ume of bright-red blood was noted to be drain- ing from the rectum. Perianal and digital rectal examinations did not reveal a source of bleed- ing. Emergency radiography of the abdomen did not reveal free air, and the colonoscopy was started. On colonoscopy, the rectum and proxi- mal sigmoid colon appeared normal (Fig. 1C). However, as the colonoscope was advanced far- ther into the sigmoid colon, multiple nonob- structing, large, friable, dark-violet lesions were identified and biopsied (Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F). Because of narrowing and severe friability, the area was not traversed with the endoscope, and the procedure was aborted.\nDr. Mauney: The patient was transferred to the\npediatric intensive care unit of this hospital. During the subsequent 2 days, an additional two units of packed red cells were transfused. Treat- ment with pantoprazole was started.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: Computed tomography (CT)\nof the abdomen and  chest  was  performed  (Fig. 2A through 2D). There was irregular thick- ening of the large bowel wall and adjacent fat stranding, with sparing of the distal sigmoid colon and rectum. The kidneys had multifocal patchy areas of hypoattenuation.\nDr. Mauney: On hospital day 5, tachycardia and tachypnea developed. The hemoglobin level was 8.8 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 67,000 per microliter. The prothrombin time was\n17.3 seconds (reference range, 11.5 to 14.5), the prothrombin-time international normalized ra- tio 1.4 (reference range, 0.9 to 1.1), the activated partial-thromboplastin time 50.0 seconds (refer- ence range, 22.0 to 36.0), and the blood d-dimer level greater than 10,000 ng per milliliter (refer- ence range, 0 to 500). Other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Westra: Thoracic CT angiography revealed\na central filling defect in the distal right pulmo- nary artery, a finding consistent with pulmonary embolism (Fig. 2E). There was also a large right pleural effusion.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "antiphos- pholipid syndrome (APS);vasculitis;systemic juvenile idiopathic ar- thritis (Still\u2019s disease);factor V Leiden;protein C or protein S deficiency;rheumatologic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus;hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis;macrophage activation syndrome",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Stacy A. Kahn: The process of generating a dif- ferential diagnosis is iterative. The framework shown below \u2014 gather, analyze, review and re- vise, and create a differential diagnosis \u2014 is a simple approach that reminds us that the dif- ferential diagnosis often evolves and should be reviewed and revised as we gather new informa- tion and analyze the data.\n\nGather\nThis patient is a 16-year-old girl with a history of obesity, anxiety, and ADHD who presented with a 5-week history of worsening abdominal pain and diarrhea that progressed to bloody diarrhea. Stool studies were negative, and she had no re- sponse to treatment with ciprofloxacin. Three weeks after starting the course of  antibiotics, she presented with anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, headache, mild arthralgias, and myalgias. On examination, she was afebrile and appeared tired, uncomfortable, and pale, with dry mucous membranes.  She  had lower abdominal tenderness but no rash or jaundice.\n\nAnalyze\nWe can start the diagnostic process by ruling  out diagnoses that do not fit with this patient\u2019s clinical picture. Polyps and polyposis syndromes, Meckel\u2019s diverticulum, and vascular malforma- tions can be ruled out because these conditions are not painful or associated with weight loss or systemic symptoms. Intussusception causes abdominal pain but is unlikely in this patient be- cause it is not associated with joint pain, weight loss, or systemic symptoms. Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura causes abdominal pain and can be as- sociated with joint pain and weight loss, but the hallmark feature is skin involvement, which was not present in this patient. We can also rule out Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic-ulcer dis- ease. These conditions can cause abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea or chronic symptoms. In addition, pa- tients with H. pylori infection or peptic-ulcer disease would typically present with reflux symp- toms and acute hematemesis or melena. Myalgias and arthralgias are not part of the clinical pre- sentation.\n\nReview\nThis patient\u2019s initial laboratory evaluation re- vealed a borderline elevated white-cell count, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, a normal platelet count, mildly elevated aminotransferase levels, and a normal bilirubin level. The C-reactive pro- tein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were markedly elevated.\n\nCreate a Differential Diagnosis\nPatients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\u2014\tincluding Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative coli- tis \u2014 typically present with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, and arthralgias, with no response to antibiotics. These findings are similar to those observed in this patient. Her borderline elevated white-cell count, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia could be consistent with IBD. However, her C-reactive protein level was higher than would be expected with this condition, and she did not have thrombocytosis, which is typi- cal of a flare of IBD. Nevertheless, IBD is still high on the list of possible diagnoses, and fur- ther evaluation that includes upper endoscopy and colonoscopy is warranted.\nOther chronic conditions, particularly rheu- matologic diseases, should be included in the differential diagnosis, given the elevated C-reac- tive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as the arthralgias, fatigue, and malaise. The predominance of gastrointestinal symptoms and the absence of arthritis, rash, and fever would be somewhat atypical for a rheumatologic diagnosis. Additional laboratory testing that includes tests for antinuclear anti- bodies and complement levels will be important. Although the stool studies were negative, in- fection should still be considered, particularly zoonotic infection because of the patient\u2019s expo- sure to animals at school and at home. However, she had no fever, rash, or respiratory or neuro-\nlogic symptoms.\nLike IBD, cancer can be associated with many of the signs and symptoms that were observed in this patient, including anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and a markedly elevated C-reactive pro- tein level. However, she had no fever, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy.\n\nRevise\nAfter the patient was admitted to the hospital, colonoscopy was performed and revealed find- ings that were highly suggestive of severe colonic ischemia.1 The differential diagnosis should be revised to include colonic ischemia, a relatively rare diagnosis in children and young adults. Potential causes of colonic ischemia include in- fections such as coronavirus disease 2019, multi- system inflammatory syndrome in children, tu- berculosis, and sepsis. Because the patient had been exposed to agricultural settings, we should consider farm-related toxins, such as insecti- cides, rodenticides, snake venom, and spider\n \ntoxins. Drug-induced colonic ischemia is rarely reported in children and is associated with the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, antipsychotic medications, illicit drugs, immunosuppressants, and vasocon- strictors, none of which this patient had taken. Cardiovascular disease and end-stage kidney disease can cause colonic ischemia but are not consistent with this patient\u2019s history.\nCT imaging was also performed. In addition to findings in the bowel, there was patchy hypo- attenuation in the kidneys, which suggests the possibility of ischemia or septic embolism.\nOn hospital day 5, the patient\u2019s clinical status suddenly worsened, with new tachypnea and tachycardia. The white-cell count increased, and she had worsening anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation of the aminotransferase levels. The activated partial-thromboplastin time was pro- longed and the d-dimer level was markedly ele- vated, but the international normalized ratio was relatively normal. Additional imaging stud- ies revealed findings consistent with pulmonary embolism. At this point, several organs \u2014 in- cluding the lungs, the kidneys, the colon, and possibly the liver \u2014 had evidence of thrombotic injury or ischemia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a consideration, but the relatively normal international normalized ratio is not consistent with this diagnosis. Also, with florid DIC, the severity of illness would be even greater. It is notable that the patient was in a hypercoagulable state in the context of a pro- longed activated partial-thromboplastin time. The differential diagnosis should be revised to include hematologic conditions such as bleeding disorders, macrophage activation syndrome, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, as well as rheumatologic conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, protein C or protein S deficiency, factor V Leiden, systemic juvenile idiopathic ar- thritis (Still\u2019s disease), vasculitis, and antiphos- pholipid syndrome (APS).\nOverall, this patient had evidence of acute ischemia involving multiple organ systems, with- out neurologic, dermatologic, or cardiac involve- ment. She had no evidence of sepsis, infection, or cancer. The family history included autoim- mune disease (celiac disease and psoriasis) and first-trimester spontaneous abortion. She was in a hypercoagulable state with thrombosis but did not have DIC. This unusual presentation is so severe and dramatic that it is catastrophic. Tak- ing this all into account, I think that this pa- tient\u2019s diagnosis is catastrophic APS (CAPS).\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sarah B. Mueller: Histologic examination of biopsy specimens of the rectum, sigmoid colon, and distal transverse colon revealed normal co- lonic mucosa  with  occasional  dilated  crypts (Fig. 3A). A biopsy specimen of the transverse colon from the area adjacent to the mass showed marked mucosal edema, hemorrhage, distorted colonic crypts,  and  multiple  fibrin  thrombi  (Fig. 3B). No classic changes associated with ischemic injury were identified, and immunohis- tochemical stains for cytomegalovirus and  her-  pes simplex virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Taken together, these findings were not consis tent with IBD and were instead suggestive of a thrombotic disorder.\nAn initial blood specimen was sent to the coagulation laboratory on hospital day 2. The prothrombin time was within the normal range (14.4 seconds), and the activated partial-throm- boplastin time was prolonged (53.6 seconds). Testing for factor Xa was negative, which indi- cated the absence of heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, heparin analogues, and factor Xa inhibitors. Testing for lupus anticoagulant was positive and did not show correction in a 1:1 mix of the patient\u2019s plasma with normal plasma, which indicated the presence of an inhibitor (e.g., a lupus anticoagulant), rather than a factor deficiency. The confirmatory hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization assay was positive. Taken together, these results are considered to be positive for a lupus anticoagulant. However, it is important to note that the patient\u2019s C-reac- tive protein level was highly elevated on admis- sion. C-reactive protein can bind to the phospho- lipids that are present in the reagents of the lupus anticoagulant assay and the hexagonal phase assay, and the hexagonal phase assay is known to have false positive results when the C-reactive protein level is similar to the level observed in this patient.2-5 Testing for anticar- diolipin IgG and IgM, anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I IgG and IgM, antiprothrombin IgG, antiphos- phatidylserine IgG and IgM, and anti\u2013phospha- tidylserine\u2013prothrombin IgG and IgM was neg- ative.\nA specimen obtained for a full hypercoagula- bility panel was sent to the coagulation labora- tory on hospital day 5. The prothrombin time and activated partial-thromboplastin time were prolonged, and both were corrected in a 1:1 mix. These findings are consistent with factor defi- ciencies. The levels of factors V, VII, XI, and XII were low; the levels of natural anticoagulants protein C and antithrombin III were low; the level of protein S was low-normal; and the levels of factors II, VIII, IX, and X were normal. These results are suggestive of evolving liver dysfunc- tion. Although the results of liver-function tests were only mildly abnormal on admission, a specimen obtained later in the day on hospital day 5 showed clinically significant elevation in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase (Table 1). Testing for activated protein C resistance, which is primarily used to screen for factor V Leiden, was nor- mal, as was genetic testing for prothrombin G20210A. Hereditary protein C and antithrom- bin III deficiencies were ruled out on subsequent testing.\nThe diagnostic criteria for APS that have been proposed by the International Society on Throm- bosis and Haemostasis require laboratory identi- fication of a lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, or anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibody in two  blood  specimens,  with  testing performed 12 or more weeks apart and within 5 years after an imaging-confirmed thrombotic event or pregnancy complication.6 Therefore, the diagnosis at this stage in the patient\u2019s course was presumptive, pending confirmation of a lupus anticoagulant or relevant antibody after at least 12 weeks.\n\nFigure 4. Additional Imaging Studies.\nA Doppler ultrasound image of the liver (Panel A), obtained on hospital day 9, shows a lack of flow in the main portal vein (between cur\u2011 sors), a finding indicative of occlusive portal vein thrombosis. The only flow signals that can be seen on this image are those of the infe\u2011 rior vena cava and the intrahepatic branches of the common hepatic artery. Ascites surrounding the liver and a pleural effusion are also present. A coronal image from a CT angiogram (Panel B), obtained on the same day, shows a lack of enhancement of the portal vein (arrowhead), a finding that confirms the presence of portal vein thrombosis. Extensive infarction in the liver and ascites are present, along with persistent distal colitis (arrow). An image obtained during the portal venous phase (Panel C) shows filling defects from non\u2011 occlusive clots in the inferior mesenteric vein (arrow), which drains the inflamed distal colon. A coronal image from a follow\u2011up CT an\u2011 giogram (Panel D), obtained 2 days later, shows the placement of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava (arrows), as well as the presence of a thrombolysis catheter in the mesenteric vein system (arrow\u2011 head). A different coronal image (Panel E) shows a persistent filling defect in the enhanced superior mesenteric vein (arrow), which is indicative of a nearly occlusive clot. An interventional venography study (Panel F), obtained with the injection of contrast material through the thrombolysis catheter (with the tip located in the upstream portion of the splenic vein), shows a patent TIPS (arrows), successful thrombolysis of the splenic vein (SV), and residual filling defects at the splenoportal confluence (arrowhead). There is no reflux of con\u2011 trast material into the superior mesenteric vein (asterisk); the absence of reflux indicates persistent thrombotic occlusion.\n\n",
