    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Neil D. Fernandes (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital because of headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 17 months before this admission, when he began to have episodes of headache and neck pain multiple times per week after an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) accident. Two months later, the patient collided with another adolescent while he was playing soccer, and the episodes of headache and neck pain worsened. He rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicat- ing the most severe pain.\nFifteen months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of another hospital. On examination, the pulse was 95 beats per minute and the blood pressure 117/78 mm Hg. There was mild tenderness in the area of the trapezius muscle. A radiograph of the cervical spine was normal. During the next 15 months, the patient was followed in the pediatric and neurology clinics of the other hospital. Ibuprofen, nortriptyline, sumatriptan, cyclobenzaprine, and diazepam were prescribed, but the headache did not abate. He underwent physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, massage therapy, and acupuncture, but the symptoms persisted.\nThree months before this admission, nausea began to occur during the episodes of headache. The pain became more intense when the patient was lying down or was physically active, resulting in tunnel vision and vomiting; after he vomited, the pain became less intense. He was evaluated at the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the pulse was 104 beats per minute and the blood pres- sure 128/80 mm Hg. At the recommendation of his physicians, the patient stopped participating in all sports.\nTwo days before this admission, the pain worsened and awoke the patient from sleep. The nausea was constant, and the vomiting occurred two times per day. The patient was unable to attend school because of the symptoms. His parents took him to the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 115 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 120/64 mm Hg. The height was\n183.6 cm, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.0. The physical examina- tion was normal. A probable diagnosis of mixed migraines and tension headaches was made. Prednisone, zolmitriptan, and ondansetron were prescribed, and the patient was sent home.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient had new severe pain on the right side of the abdomen that awoke him from sleep. The headache, neck pain, and nausea were constant. The patient was taken to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 160 beats per minute, the blood pressure 239/162 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The white-cell count was 22,380 per microliter (reference range at other hospital, 3800 to 10,500), the lactic acid level 2.7 mmol per liter (24 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per li- ter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]), and the creatinine level 1.3 mg per deciliter (115 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [53 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with increased R-wave and S-wave amplitudes in the precordial leads, as well as nonspecific repolarization abnormali- ties. One hour later, a repeat ECG showed an ectopic atrial rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions at a rate of 66 beats per minute.\nIntravenous hydromorphone, morphine, ondan-\nsetron, metoclopramide, and lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered. A nitroglycerin in- fusion was started, and the systolic blood pres- sure decreased to 143 mm Hg; the infusion was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure in- creased to 212 mm Hg. Intravenous labetalol was administered, and the systolic blood pres- sure decreased to 92 mm Hg. An esmolol infu- sion was started, and the patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital, arriving 3 hours after presentation to the other hospital. Shortly after his arrival, the esmolol infusion was stopped.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional his-\ntory was obtained. The patient had played paint- ball a few days earlier but did not recall any direct trauma to the chest or abdomen. A review of systems was notable for heat intolerance and night sweats. He had a history of acne and had received a diagnosis of pneumonia involving the right upper lobe 10 months before this admis- sion. He had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccines. His medications included doxycycline and topical tretinoin, clindamycin, and benzoyl peroxide, in addition to zolmitriptan and ondansetron; he had not started taking the recently prescribed pred- nisone. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of New England with his parents and younger brother. He performed well in high school. Before the recent progression of his symptoms, he had par- ticipated in soccer, basketball, and track. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He drank one or two alcoholic beverages per month. His father and paternal grandparents had hyperten- sion, and his maternal aunts had migraines; his mother and brother were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 126 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure 90/44 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. He appeared tired, pale, and diaphoretic. He was in distress because of the pain; he spoke in brief sentences and had frequent hiccups. The abdo- men was nondistended with marked tenderness in the right upper quadrant and right flank, with rebound and guarding. The skin was warm and clammy, and some inguinal hyperpigmentation was present. No caf\u00e9 au lait spots were noted.\nThe white-cell count was 27,140 per microliter (reference range at this hospital, 4500 to 13,000), the lactic acid level 3.4 mmol per liter (31 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]), the creatinine level 1.64 mg per deciliter (145 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the high-sensitivity troponin T level 188 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On hospital day 2, urinalysis revealed 1+ blood, trace ketones, a pH of 5.0, and a specific gravity of 1.015; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed squamous cells, crystals, and mucin, as well as 3 to 5 hyaline casts per high-power field, less than 10 white cells per high-power field, and no red cells.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Kristian R. Olson: This 16-year-old boy pre- sented with signs and symptoms that have a number of overlapping causes. To first approach this case, I will define the foreground issues, which are the features of this patient\u2019s current presentation: hypertensive emergency, headache, and severe abdominal pain. Then, to build a dif- ferential diagnosis, I will consider the back- ground issues, which are the unique features of this patient\u2019s history that may be contributing to the current problem: a 17-month history of worsening episodic headache and evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG. By reconciling the foreground issues with the background issues, I will attempt to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\nForeground \u2014 Hypertensive Emergency\nThe patient presented to the other hospital with a  blood  pressure  of  239/162  mm  Hg  and  evi- dence of myocardial and kidney injury, which were manifestations of hypertensive emergency.1 In the pediatric population, causes of hyperten- sive emergency vary according to age. In children 13 to 18 years of age, possible causes include primary hypertension due to metabolic syndrome, parenchymal or vascular disease of the kidneys, aortic coarctation, ingestion of certain medica- tions or illicit substances, intracranial tumors, endocrine causes such as Cushing\u2019s syndrome and pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, and metabolic causes such as porphyria.1\nCan any of these entities be ruled out at this point? Parenchymal or vascular disease of the kidneys frequently causes chronic hypertension before other end-organ damage. Although hyper- tension may not be recognized in a pediatric primary care office, there is no evidence that an abnormal blood-pressure measurement had been obtained in this patient before the current pre- sentation.2 In addition, there is no mention of a history of urinary tract infection, unexplained fever, flank pain (before the current presenta- tion), dysuria, edema, or abdominal bruits. Be- cause the patient had an increasing creatinine level, his renal injury is probably acute.\nAortic coarctation is more common in male patients than in female patients, but it usually occurs at a younger age. It is typically associated with bruits and may be heralded by the detection of lower blood-pressure measurements in the legs than in the arms, and neither of these find- ings was specifically mentioned in this case.\nIt would be prudent to perform a toxicologic screen in this patient. However, his medication list does not include any drugs associated with hypertensive emergency, and his history does not suggest that ingestion of illicit substances is likely.\n\nBackground \u2014 Headache\nBefore the current admission, this patient\u2019s most disruptive symptom was episodic headache of in- creasing frequency and severity. Although there are many causes of headache, the nature and time course of the episodes and the response to treatments can help in determining the diagnosis. At least 27% of 16-to-18-year-olds have recur- rent headache.3 In children, the most common cause of recurrent episodic headache is migraines, which are typically associated with throbbing pain and worsen with activity, resulting in activ- ity avoidance. The second most common cause is tension headaches, which are typically associ- ated with diffuse nonthrobbing pain predomi- nantly in the occipital region and do not worsen with activity. This patient had features of both migraines and tension headaches. However, dur- ing the 15 months before the current admission, he underwent trials of drugs that are normally effective in the treatment of these conditions and his headache did not abate, which suggests that his chronic headache is due to another cause. Headaches caused by an intracranial tumor are typically progressive, result in nausea and vomiting, and are associated with increased in- tracranial pressure, which causes pain to worsen when the patient is lying down and to improve after the patient vomits; all these features were noted in this patient. However, patients with an intracranial tumor typically present with at least one neurologic finding, such as impaired vision, unsteady gait, changes in behavior or school performance, or impaired growth; none of these\nfindings were present in this patient.\nChronic post-traumatic headaches are an ob- vious consideration in this patient, since he had been injured 17 months earlier in an ATV ac- cident and again 2 months later in a collision while he was playing soccer. Whiplash or con- cussion can result in prolonged chronic post- traumatic headaches. The most common associated symptoms include dizziness (in 59% of patients), fatigue (91%), noise sensitivity (49%), irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and loss of con- centration4; this patient did not report any of these symptoms. Furthermore, most patients with chronic post-traumatic headaches recover within 3 months after the trauma, with only 10 to 15% reporting persistent symptoms at 1 year. Finally, severe hypertension can cause head- ache and increased intracranial pressure. Because this patient had hypertensive emergency and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, uncontrolled hypertension is the most likely\ncause of his headache.\n\nReconciling the Foreground with the Background\nIn reconciling the main foreground and back- ground issues, I will focus on five conditions that could have caused hypertensive emergency and headache in this patient: metabolic syn- drome, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, porphyria, hyper- thyroidism, and pheochromocytoma and para- ganglioma.\n\nMetabolic Syndrome\nTo receive a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, a patient must meet three of the following five criteria: central obesity, hyperglycemia, hypertri- glyceridemia, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and hypertension.5 This patient had hypertension and hyperglycemia but did not meet the other criteria; he was in the 85th per- centile for BMI, which is consistent with over- weight, not obese, status. Therefore, his hyper- tensive emergency did not develop in the context of metabolic syndrome.\n\nCushing\u2019s Syndrome\nCushing\u2019s syndrome is a multisystem disorder caused by prolonged exposure to excess gluco- corticoids. It is associated with weight gain and hypertension and can result in headaches. Severe abdominal pain, although rare, may occur when an ectopic adrenocorticotropic tumor that causes Cushing\u2019s syndrome results in rupture of a viscus. Children with Cushing\u2019s syndrome most com- monly present with weight gain without con- comitant height gain.6 In this case, measure- ments from only one time point are provided, but it is unlikely that the patient had fallen off his growth trajectory, since he was in the 90th percentile for height. Attempts at predictive scor- ing have identified osteoporosis, muscular atro- phy, livid striae, plethora, ecchymoses, and a dorsocervical fat pad as key findings of Cush- ing\u2019s syndrome,7 and none of these findings were present in this patient.\n\nPorphyria\nPorphyria is a rare condition of disordered heme synthesis. It is associated with central nervous system (CNS) involvement (including headaches) and abdominal pain and can cause hypertension and tachycardia. However, other CNS effects include agitation, insomnia, hallucinations, and in many cases hyponatremia, findings that were not present in this patient. Symptomatic attacks most frequently occur between 14 and 45 years of age, but they occur more often in female pa- tients than in male patients (4:1).8 Abdominal pain tends to be the primary symptom; it is typically located in the lower abdomen, is colicky in character, and does not cause peritonitis.\n\nHyperthyroidism\nHyperthyroidism can cause hypertension, heat intolerance, night sweats, and headaches. If un- treated, hyperthyroidism results in accelerated growth with decelerated weight gain9; this pa- tient was overweight. Hyperthyroidism can also result in poor school performance and emo- tional lability, findings that were not present in this patient. Other common findings include brisk reflexes and proximal muscle weakness. Although the results of a neurologic examina- tion are not explicitly provided in this case, there is no mention of these signs suggestive of hyper- thyroidism.\n\nPheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are neuroendocrine tumors derived from the adrenal me- dulla and paravertebral autonomic ganglia, respec- tively. The symptoms of excess catecholamines, which may be secreted by these tumors, can mimic more than 30 other medical disorders.10 This patient presented with four of the five clas- sic findings of pheochromocytoma, known as the \u201cfive Hs\u201d: he had hypertension, headache, hyperglycemia, and possible hyperhidrosis but did not have hypermetabolism.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Katherine Nimkin: Ultrasonography revealed a heterogeneous right adrenal mass (Fig. 1A and 1B). Computed tomography (CT) revealed par- tial enhancement of the mass and surrounding hemorrhage (Fig. 1C and 1D). These imaging features are most consistent with adrenal pheo- chromocytoma. In patients with pheochromocy- toma, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would typically reveal an adrenal mass that is hypo- intense on T1-weighted imaging and has very bright signal (described as a light-bulb appear- ance) on T2-weighted imaging, although the findings can vary because of hemorrhage. CT and MRI have more than 90% sensitivity for the detection of these tumors, as well as 70 to 80% specificity.12 Functional imaging by means of scintigraphy with 123I-labeled MIBG (metaiodo- benzylguanidine) can be performed. In addi- tion, positron-emission tomography and CT with 68Ga-labeled DOTATATE (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodo- decane\u20131,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid\u2013octreotate), which has high affinity for the somatostatin receptors present in these tumors, has been shown to have high sensitivity for the detection of metastatic or multifocal disease.\n\nFigure 1. Abdominal Imaging Studies.\nSagittal and transverse ultrasound images of the right upper quadrant (Panels A and B, respectively) show a large heterogeneous right adrenal mass (arrows). Coronal and sagittal delayed contrast\u2011enhanced CT images of the ab\u2011 domen (Panels C and D, respectively) show a noncalcified, heterogeneously enhancing right adrenal mass (arrows), measuring 7 cm in diameter, displacing the right kidney inferiorly. There is hyperdense soft tissue (arrowheads) sur\u2011 rounding the right kidney and extending into the right flank, a finding consistent with hemorrhage.\n\nDr. Zehra Ordulu: Levels of free metanephrines (metanephrine and normetanephrine) in plasma or levels of fractionated metanephrines in a 24- hour urine sample can be obtained to establish the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.13 Some experts advocate for the measurement of plas- ma levels of free metanephrines to be used as the first-line test, given the high negative pre- dictive value and the simplicity of obtaining the specimen,14 especially in patients for whom there is a high index of suspicion for this diag- nosis. The measurement of levels of fraction- ated metanephrines in a 24-hour urine sample can be used as a confirmatory test to rule out the possibility of a false positive result, given the low incidence of pheochromocytoma. Al- though the measurement of levels of catechol- amines and their metabolites in a 24-hour urine sample is the preferred first-line test for the diagnosis of neuroblastoma,15 elevated lev- els can also be seen in patients with pheochro- mocytoma. In this patient, plasma levels of free metanephrines obtained on hospital day 1 were elevated (Table 2), as were levels of frac- tioned metanephrines, catecholamines, and other catecholamine metabolites in a 24-hour urine sample; these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.\n\nTable 2.
