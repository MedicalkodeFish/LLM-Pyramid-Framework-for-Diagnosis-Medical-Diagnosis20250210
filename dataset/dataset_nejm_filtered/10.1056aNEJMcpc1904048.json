    "Primary Symptom": "A 20-Month-Old Boy with Severe Anemia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Nicole de Paz (Pediatrics): A 20-month-old boy was admitted to the pediatric inten- sive care unit of this hospital because of severe anemia.\nThe patient was well until 5 days before admission, when his aunt noted that he had begun tugging his ear and suspected that he might be having pain. He did not have fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. His aunt took him to the emergency department at another hospital, where acute otitis media was diag- nosed and a course of oral amoxicillin was prescribed.\nThe next day, the patient began vomiting. During the next 3 days, multiple episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. His aunt fed him an oral electrolyte solution. During this time, the patient did not have a bowel movement. He also appeared pale, was less active than usual, and had a decreased volume of urine output. The day before admission, he drank milk and ate pizza without vomiting, but he seemed tired and increasingly pale. On the morning of admis- sion, the patient\u2019s aunt took him to a primary care pediatric clinic for evaluation. In the clinic, the patient appeared ill; pallor, tachycardia, and tachypnea were present. The hemoglobin level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was reportedly 2.9 g per deciliter, the hematocrit 9.0%, and the white-cell count 33,000 per microliter.\nThe patient was referred to the emergency department of a community hospital affiliated with this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient\u2019s aunt reported that the child seemed to be short of breath. On examination, he appeared listless and pale and had occa- sional grunting. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 150 beats per minute, the blood pressure 84/59 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 44 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 11.7 kg (61st percentile for age). The mucous membranes were pale. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia and a gallop rhythm were present. The radial and dorsalis pedis pulses were normal, and the capillary refill time was less than 2 seconds. The lungs were clear. The abdomen was distended, and hepatosplenomegaly was present, with no tenderness or masses and with normal bowel sounds. There was firm stool in the rectal vault; a fecal occult blood test was negative. Multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules were present. The remainder of the examination was normal. A peripheral intravenous catheter was inserted, and supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. A blood sample was obtained for culture and laboratory testing; the hematocrit was 6.7%, the white-cell count 36,450 per microliter, and the platelet count 995,000 per microliter. Other lab- oratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: Frontal and lateral chest\nradiographs showed hyperinflated lungs, cardio- megaly, and enlargement of the central pulmo- nary vessels (Fig. 1A and 1B). There was no evi- dence of pleural effusion. These findings are nonspecific and can be present in patients with congenital heart diseases, including those with a left-to-right shunt, cardiomyopathy, or heart failure.\nDr. Ana M. Rosales: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2A) showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 155 beats per minute with left ventricular hypertrophy and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities. The QRS axis of depolarization was 54 degrees. The QRS dura- tion and the remainder of the intervals were normal for the patient\u2019s age. The estimated cor- rected QT (QTc) interval was 404 msec.\nDr. de Paz: After consultation with a pediatric hematologist\u2013oncologist was obtained, the pa- tient was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit at this hospital.\nOn admission of the patient to this hospital, the aunt reported that the child had not been seen by a pediatrician as frequently as is typi- cally recommended for infants and toddlers be- cause of a complex social situation; she did not think that he had ever undergone any blood testing. He had not received all the recommend- ed routine immunizations; a detailed vaccination history was not immediately available. The patient had been born after 36 weeks 5 days of gestation and had been treated with oral morphine after birth because of neonatal abstinence syndrome. He was receiving amoxicillin and had no known allergies. He lived with his aunt and cousins in an urban area of New England and had not trav- eled. His diet included a variety of foods, includ- ing meats and vegetables, and he typically drank 0.6 liters of cow\u2019s milk each day. His father had multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules, and his mother and father had substance-use disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was whimpering and reaching out to be held by his aunt; he ap- peared ill and pale. The temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the pulse 155 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure 98/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 66 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. On auscul- tation of the heart, tachycardia, a gallop rhythm, and a systolic murmur (grade 4/6) were present; the precordium was hyperdynamic. Tachypnea, nasal flaring, abdominal breathing, and mild sub- costal retractions were present, and soft crack- les could be heard occasionally on examination of the lungs. The abdomen was distended, the spleen extended 6 cm below the left costal mar- gin, and the liver extended 5 cm below the right costal margin. The hands and feet were cool, and the capillary refill time was less than 2 sec- onds. On examination of the skin, multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules were noted, as were inguinal freckling and a hemangioma on the right buttock that measured 1 cm in diameter. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nDr. Shailam: An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest showed severe cardiomegaly with mild interstitial pulmonary edema (Fig. 1C).\nDr. Rosales: Echocardiography (Fig. 2B through 2E) revealed normal segmental anatomy, with a patent foramen ovale and left-to-right blood flow. No septal defects were identified. The valvular anatomy was normal, and there was mild mitral regurgitation with mild enlargement of both atria. The origin and proximal course of the coronary arteries appeared normal. The pulmo- nary and systemic venous return appeared nor- mal. The aortic arch had normal branching and was not obstructed. There was no evidence of a ductus arteriosus. The left ventricle was moder- ately to severely dilated, with preserved systolic function.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Brian M. Cummings: This child presents with multiple clinical signs that are suggestive of bi- ventricular heart failure, including gastrointesti- nal symptoms, tachycardia, tachypnea, crackles, hepatosplenomegaly, cool hands and feet, a gal- lop rhythm, and a systolic murmur (grade 4/6). In addition, his chest radiograph shows cardio- megaly, laboratory testing reveals a low serum bicarbonate level suggestive of acidosis, and an echocardiogram shows left ventricular dilatation with preserved ejection fraction and no evidence of structural congenital heart disease. The pa- tient\u2019s cardiac output has increased to compen- sate for low oxygen content in the blood result- ing from anemia, and I am concerned that cardiogenic shock will occur if the patient does not receive immediate intervention. Given his degree of anemia, there are three interventions that we should quickly consider to stabilize the patient\u2019s clinical condition.\n\nFluid Expansion\nWould a fluid bolus enhance this patient\u2019s car- diac output? On the basis of our understanding of cardiac physiology and the Starling curve, at first glance, a fluid bolus of 5 to 10 ml per kilo- gram would expand ventricular preload, resulting in enhanced ventricular stroke volume. However, in this patient, I am concerned that this inter- vention may actually worsen cardiac function, cause further hemodilution of the red cells, and worsen oxygen delivery. The Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial involving chil- dren with compensated shock showed higher mortality among children who received a f luid bolus than among those who received no bolus,\n \nparticularly among the children who were ane- mic or were in states of sympathetic compensa- tion. Thus, f luid should be given with extreme caution.1-3\n\nTransfusion\nTransfusion of red cells should be considered early in this patient. The basic underlying physi- ological problem is low oxygen content in the blood and impaired oxygen delivery, resulting in a compensatory increase in the patient\u2019s cardiac output. Although an immediate transfusion of packed red cells seems intuitive, it is important to first rule out hemolysis as the cause of this patient\u2019s anemia. Recent guidelines emphasize a more restrictive transfusion strategy in pedi- atric critical care,4 but in this case, transfusion would be lifesaving and should be performed im- mediately.\n\nSupplemental Oxygen\nPerhaps the most critical intervention for this patient is the administration of supplemental oxygen to increase the partial pressure of oxygen. An increase in the oxygen saturation will in- crease the amount of bound hemoglobin, and an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen as a dissolved component can also play an important role in critical states of anemia. A healthy child should have an arterial oxygen content between 15 ml and 20 ml per deciliter, depending on age. In a child with severe anemia, such as this patient,the oxygen content is reduced to 20% of the normal level. The administration of 3 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, as this patient initially received, will increase the oxygen content slightly \u2014 by approximately 15%\u2014 but the administration of high-flow oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask can potential- ly increase the oxygen content by 65% (although this increase would result in a level that is still only one third of the normal oxygen-content level). Studies in adults have shown that increas- ing the partial pressure of oxygen can decrease the heart rate to a rate similar to that achieved after transfusion.5 Thus, the most important life- saving intervention in this patient is administration of supplemental oxygen through a non- rebreather face mask. Once these interventions are in place, we can take a step back and construct a differential diagnosis to explain why this pa- tient is profoundly anemic and critically ill.\nTo establish the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s anemia, we need to determine whether red cells are being lost, being destroyed, or not being produced. Or, is his anemia the result of a com- bination of these three processes?\n\nBlood Loss\nIn children, severe anemia that is due to blood loss typically results from trauma; the most common type, seen in neonates, is birth trauma. In children and teenagers, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or menses are also common sources of severe anemia from blood loss. Final- ly, one might consider a bleeding disorder. This child has no family history of bleeding disor- ders, although a new mutation resulting in a co- agulation disorder is possible. There is no his- tory of blood in the stool or of changes in the consistency of the stool that would lead to sus- picion of a gastrointestinal tract disorder, and there is no known history of trauma. A guaiac stool test, which was negative in this case, should always be performed to rule out occult blood loss from the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nRed-Cell Destruction\nIncreased red-cell destruction is another common functional cause of anemia. This process can be antibody-mediated and acquired during an acute infection, or it can be caused by exposure to a drug or toxin. Red-cell membranopathies, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, can lead to rapid red-cell destruction. Hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, may also lead to a shortened red-cell life span. De- fects in red-cell metabolism could also result in red-cell destruction. Glucose-6-phosphate dehy- drogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most com- mon red-cell enzyme deficiency in the world, affecting more than 400 million people, mainly those of Mediterranean descent. It results from a defect on the X chromosome that leads to ac- cumulation of reactive oxidative species in the red cells and hemolysis. This male patient had a recent acute ear infection and exposure to amoxi- cillin, each of which could potentially cause he- molysis and could explain the findings of an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level and spleno- megaly. However, the absence of icterus and of elevated bilirubin levels in this patient makes hemolysis unlikely. The patient has had no exposure to a food or medication that would suggest hemolysis resulting from G6PD deficiency, such as ingestion of fava beans or use of sulfa drugs. A Coombs\u2019 test, a peripheral-blood smear, and blood typing and screening should be performed to further assess whether hemolysis is contributing to this patient\u2019s clinical presentation.\n\nDecreased Red-Cell Production\nCould decreased production of red cells be caus- ing this patient\u2019s profound anemia? Parvovirus B19 infection can cause severe aplastic anemia, usually in the context of an underlying hemo- lytic process. Conditions that result in ineffec- tive erythropoiesis, such as iron deficiency, vita- min B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, and toxic effects from exposure to lead, are possible. This patient has a slightly elevated mean corpuscular volume that is consistent with macrocytic anemia. The fact that the patient typically drank 0.6 liters of milk per day and has a high red-cell distribu- tion width and an elevated platelet count sug- gests iron deficiency, but the fact that he does not have microcytosis is not consistent with iron deficiency. Diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia should be considered in young persons, although patients typically have a normal white-cell count and platelet count and characteristic facial features. Testing for the levels of adenosine deaminase and hemoglobin F might be helpful to make a diagnosis. Transient erythroblastopenia in chil- dren can lead to anemia and reticulocytopenia and can be seen in children younger than 6 years of age. Typically, there is a preceding viral illness and mild neutropenia, and it occurs more com- monly in boys than in girls. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a consideration in this case, but I would expect elevated liver-function test results and cytopenia. The level of ferritin or soluble interleukin-2 can be measured to assist in the evaluation for hemophagocytic lympho- histiocytosis. Finally, one should consider leuke- mia as a potential cause of this patient\u2019s anemia; leukemia could cause pancytopenia but could also be associated with an elevated white-cell count.\nIt is unclear whether this child is presenting\nwith an acute or chronic disease. His condition appeared to be stable when he presented to the emergency department a few days before this admission, but a complete blood count had not been performed. There is no evidence of bleed- ing or hemolysis. The laboratory evaluation is not diagnostic for iron deficiency, and the severity of his presentation suggests a more serious disor- der. It appears that anemia due to decreased red-cell production is the most likely cause of his illness. The elevated white-cell count, the presence of thrombocytosis, and the elevated prothrombin time, as well as the elevated uric acid and lactate dehydrogenase levels, suggest high cell turnover, pointing the differential diagnosis toward a po- tential cancer.\n \nNeurofibromatosis Type 1\nThe patient has multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules on his body. Although this is a common finding in children and is reported to occur in 10% of the general population, the presence of multiple le- sions can suggest genetic disorders, such as the McCune\u2013Albright syndrome or neurofibromato- sis. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is the most com- mon such disorder, and the presence of more than six caf\u00e9 au lait lesions is highly predictive of this diagnosis.6 The patient also has inguinal freckling, which enhances suspicion. Neurofibro- matosis type 1 is a clinical diagnosis, and there are clinical diagnostic criteria to help establish the diagnosis (Table 2).\nNeurofibromatosis type 1 is associated with cancer, including malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumors in 10% of affected patients and optic gliomas (which are often indolent) in 15% of affected patients.8-11 Associations with rhabdo- myosarcoma and pheochromocytoma have also been described. A feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 that is especially pertinent to this patient is the risk of leukemia, particularly juvenile myelo- monocytic leukemia, with the subsequent risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia owing to a loss of the wild-type allele through mutation or recombination.\nGiven this patient\u2019s multiple caf\u00e9 au lait macules, which are suggestive of neurofibromatosis type 1, his severe anemia, and the lack of findings consistent with blood loss or hemolysis, I suspect that leukemia is the most likely diagnosis in this case. A peripheral-blood smear and a bone marrow biopsy would be the most expedi- tious strategy to establish the diagnosis of acute leukemia.\n\n",

Specimens of Peripheral Blood and Bone Marrow.\nWright\u2019s staining of a peripheral\u2011blood smear (Panel A) shows profound anemia, thrombocytosis, and occasion\u2011 al blasts (arrows). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow (Panel B) shows that the marrow is 100% cellular, with increased eosino\u2011 philic forms and numerous dysplastic megakaryocytes. These findings are also shown at higher magnification (Panel C, arrows) as well as on Giemsa staining (Panel D, arrows). Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of the aspirate smear at high magnification (Panel E) shows a blast (arrow) and a dysplastic megakaryocyte (arrowhead). Reticulin staining (Panel F) shows markedly increased reticulin fibers consistent with reticulin fibrosis of grade 2 to 3 of 3. Immunohistochemical staining for CD34 (Panel G) shows increased myeloid blasts (approximately 5 to 10% of the marrow cells). Immunohistochemical staining for CD61 (Panel H) confirms the increased number of mega\u2011 karyocytes and highlights their small size and hypolo\u2011 bated appearance, findings consistent with a dysplastic morphologic abnormality.\n\nDr. Valentina Nardi: Examination of the peripheral- blood smear revealed profound anemia, marked thrombocytosis, monocytosis, mature and oc- casional left-shifted myeloid elements, and im- mature cells with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli consistent with blasts (Fig. 3A). No Auer rods were seen. Flow-cytometric analysis of the peripheral-blood specimen confirmed the pres- ence of blasts (approximately 5% of the cells) and revealed that they were of myeloid origin on the basis of their immunophenotype (CD33+/\u2212, CD13+/\u2212,  MPO\u2212,  CD117+,  CD34+,  HLA-DR+,\nCD19\u2212,  CD38+/\u2212,  CD20\u2212,  and  terminal  deoxy-\nnucleotidyl transferase [TdT]\u2212).\nA bone marrow biopsy was performed to nar- row the differential diagnosis, which, at the time, included infection, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase or blast crisis, myelodysplastic\u2013myeloproliferative neoplasm, and myelodysplastic syndrome in con- junction with iron deficiency\u2013induced thrombo- cythemia, among other possible diagnoses. Ex- amination of the bone marrow biopsy specimen revealed 100% cellularity; numerous small, hypolobated,  dysplastic  megakaryocytes  highlighted by an immunohistochemical stain for CD61; increased eosinophilic forms; increased myeloid blasts (approximately 5 to 10% of the marrow cells, highlighted by immunohistochemical stain- ing for CD34); and reticulin fibrosis of grade 2 to 3 of 3 (Fig. 3B through 3H). These findings are diagnostic of a myeloid neoplasm and are strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of myelodys- plastic\u2013myeloproliferative neoplasm.\nConventional cytogenetic analysis revealed monosomy 7 in 17 of 17 metaphases and no evidence of a BCR-ABL1 rearrangement or of any other genetic abnormalities consistent with acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 for example, inv(16) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22). Mutational analysis of 103 genes by means of a clinical anchored multi- plex polymerase-chain-reaction\u2013based next-gener- ation sequencing assay performed on the bone marrow aspirate revealed four mutations: two pathogenic mutations in neurofibromin 1 (NF1) (NF1 splice donor variant [ENST00000358273.4: c.2850+1G\u2192A] at a variant allele frequency of 52% and NF1  ENSP00000351015.4: p.Ile679AspfsTer21 [ENST00000358273.4: c.2033dupC] at a variant allele frequency of 34%) and two presumed pathogenic mutations in enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) (EZH2\tENSP00000320147.2:\tp.Cys528Arg\n[ENST00000320356.2: c.1582T\u2192C] at a variant al- lele frequency of 26% and EZH2 ENSP00000320147.2: p.Asn152IlefsTer15  [ENST00000320356.2: c.455delA]\nat a variant allele frequency of 24%). The NF1 splice donor mutation c.2850+1G\u2192A, detected at a variant allele frequency of approximately 50%, can occur as a germline pathogenic mutation and can lead to neurofibromatosis type 1 (ClinVar NM\n_000267.3[NF1]: c.2850+1G\u2192T SCV000581340.3 and SCV000808263.1).12\nTaken together, the clinical, morphologic, and genetic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, a rare myelo- dysplastic\u2013myeloproliferative neoplasm that, in approximately 10% of cases, occurs in children with neurofibromatosis type 1. This case also included some unusual features (e.g., thrombo- cytosis, eosinophilia, and increased bone marrow fibrosis). Mutations in EZH2 have been described in patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leuke- mia who have NF1 mutations and monosomy 7.\n",
