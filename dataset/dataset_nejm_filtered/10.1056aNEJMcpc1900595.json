    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 53-year-old man was evaluated in an urgent care clinic of this hospital for 3 months of cough.\nFive years before the current evaluation, the patient began to have exertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, with a resting left ventricular outflow gradient of 110 mm Hg on echocardiography. Although he received medical therapy, symptoms persisted, and percutaneous alcohol septal ablation was performed 1 year before the current evaluation, with resolution of the exertional dyspnea.\nNine months later, the patient began to have cough that was intermittently productive of yellow sputum. The cough developed shortly after he had returned from travel to Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Antitussive medications did not provide symptom relief. Three years before this cough developed, three discrete episodes of upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis had occurred, for which courses of amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and azithro- mycin had been prescribed. During the current episode, the cough waxed and waned in intensity, with no clear relation to other symptoms or the time of day.\nTen days before the current evaluation, the patient traveled to the Middle East; the weather was colder than he had expected and he felt chills. During the trip, the cough worsened \u2014 with more frequent and copious production of yellow- green sputum and associated coryza, pharyngitis, frontal sinus \u201cheaviness,\u201d malaise, and fatigue \u2014 such that he had to miss work after he returned home. He called his cardiologist and was advised to present to an urgent care clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nA review of systems was negative for fever, anorexia, unintentional weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, hemoptysis, chest pressure or discomfort, pleuritic pain, wheezing, light-headedness, palpitations, syncope, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and pruritus. The patient had had multiple contacts with nonspecific illnesses while he had been traveling both 3 months and 10 days before the current evaluation. The most recent tuberculin skin test had been performed 10 years earlier and had been negative. He had not undergone seasonal influ- enza vaccination.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was also notable for placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013 defibrillator (ICD) for ventricular tachycardia that had been induced during an electrophysiological study. He had allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, gonococcal urethritis, and dyslipidemia. Medications included metoprolol succinate and atorvastatin. He had had no known adverse reac- tions to medications, except prolongation of the corrected QT interval with disopyramide.\nThe patient was born in South Asia, raised in the Middle East, and educated in the United States, where he had lived for the past 25 years. He was an executive and traveled frequently for work, generally to urban areas and only rarely to rural areas, although he had walked barefoot near beaches in various locations in Southeast Asia. He was divorced and had a child. He smoked cigars occasionally and drank 1 to 2 glasses of wine nightly but did not use illicit substances. He had been sexually active while traveling but had used condoms. Several first-degree relatives had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. His mother had died 3 years earlier from pulmonary tuberculosis, but he had not been in contact with her during her illness.\n \nOn examination, the patient appeared to be comfortable. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/89  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  14  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. During the evalu- ation, the patient coughed twice, and the second cough produced light-green sputum with a bloody streak. The oropharynx had no erythema or exu- dates, but there was a slight yellow discoloration on the tongue. There was no tenderness on per- cussion of the sinuses or conjunctival hyperemia. There was no cervical, submandibular, supracla- vicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Ausculta- tion revealed a clear chest, without rales, wheez- ing, or egophony. The jugular venous pulse was 6 cm of water. There was a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur (grade 3/6) along the left ster- nal border that increased during a Valsalva ma- neuver. There was no edema or calf tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 1) showed clear lungs and a slightly enlarged heart, findings that had not changed from a study obtained 1 year earlier.\nThere was a dual-lead ICD that terminated in the right atrium and right ventricle.\nDr. Dudzinski: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2) was notable for sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and T-wave inversions in leads I, aVL, V4, V5, and V6, findings that had not changed from previous tracings. A 5-day course of azithromycin was prescribed, along with acet- aminophen, oxymetazoline nasal spray, and a phenol-based topical throat spray. A tuberculin skin test was negative for induration. Results of liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60%, a maximum left ventricular wall thickness of 16 mm, systolic anterior motion of the mitral-valve chordae with trace mitral regurgitation, and a resting left ven- tricular outflow gradient of 16 mm Hg; these findings had not changed from a study obtained 9 months earlier.\nAzithromycin therapy resulted in decreased fatigue and malaise and reduced the frequency of the cough but did not eliminate it. A few epi- sodes of hemoptysis with scant blood occurred, and bloody streaks were present in nasal mucus. After the patient completed the course of azithro- mycin, additional laboratory tests were performed (Table 1). Cultures of the stool and sputum were negative, as was examination of the stool and sputum for ova and parasites. A hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel (including a test for antibod- ies to aspergillus) was also negative, as were tests for galactomannan, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, and antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2. Testing for antibodies to para- gonimus was negative, but testing for antibodies to strongyloides was positive.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Rachel P. Simmons: This 53-year-old man with a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyop- athy and allergic rhinitis presented to this hos- pital with a chronic illness of 3 months\u2019 dura- tion that was characterized by intermittently productive cough, marked peripheral eosinophilia (with an absolute eosinophil count of 3800 to 4550 per cubic millimeter), an elevated IgE level, and normal results on pulmonary examination and chest radiography. His history is also nota- ble for extensive travel and habitation in Asia and the Middle East.\nAlthough several features of this patient\u2019s presentation could point us toward the diagnosis, I will focus my differential diagnosis on the development of marked peripheral eosinophilia and symptoms that were localized to the respi- ratory system. His travel history warrants a thorough workup for tissue-invasive parasites, particularly helminths; however, a multitude of noninfectious diseases can also cause peripheral eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms. The peripheral eosinophil count can be elevated in a broad range of diseases.1 Peripheral eosinophilia is generally defined as mild (with an eosinophil count of 500 to 1500 per cubic millimeter), marked (1501 to 5000 per cubic millimeter), or massive (>5000 per cubic millimeter).2,3\nNoninfectious Causes of Eosinophilia Eosinophilia can be either a primary or a sec- ondary feature of a disorder (Table 2). Primary causes of eosinophilia and respiratory symptoms are eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granu- lomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosino- philic syndromes. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a severe, progressive illness that develops over a period of days to weeks; this tempo of disease does not fit with this patient\u2019s clinical course.4 Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is an idiopathic disease characterized by dyspnea and alveolar infiltrates, and patients often have a history of asthma.5,6 This patient had a history of allergic rhinitis but did not have asthma, his presenting symptoms included cough but not dyspnea, and his chest radiograph did not show alveolar infil- trates. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with poly- angiitis is a systemic vasculitis of small and medium-sized arteries, and its hallmark features are asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and rhinosinusitis. This patient meets only one of the six American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria, and thus this diagnosis is unlikely.6,7 Hypereosinophilic syndromes are a group of rare disorders characterized by persistent peripheral eosinophilia and organ damage, including pul- monary involvement.5,6 Alternative causes of eo- sinophilia, such as infection, must be ruled out before this diagnosis can be considered.\n\nAllergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis and Fungal Infections\nMarked peripheral eosinophilia is a central fea- ture of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, which is a hypersensitivity reaction to airway colonization by the ubiquitous mold aspergillus.5 Affected patients typically have productive cough and asthma exacerbations that improve with the administration of prednisone.8,9 In this patient, the absence of asthma symptoms and the negative test for antibodies to aspergillus make allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis unlikely. Fungal infections, such as coccidioidomycosis, have been associated with peripheral eosinophilia,10 but the eosinophil count is typically low, not exceeding 3000 per cubic millimeter. This patient had no specific exposures or risks of such infections. In addition to fungal infections, pulmonary tuber- culosis is a consideration, but it has rarely been associated with mild peripheral eosinophilia.\nParasitic Infections\nGiven this patient\u2019s extensive travel in tropical and subtropical regions, parasitic infection is a major consideration in this case.12 Helminths can cause peripheral eosinophilia as they migrate through or invade tissue, and the degree of eosino- philia can vary during the life cycle of the parasite. \nSeveral helminthic infections are associated with clinically significant eosinophilia and cough. Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) oc- curs approximately 2 to 12 weeks after exposure to organisms in fresh water.13 After larvae pene- trate the skin, they travel through the lungs and circulation, causing a sudden onset of fever, cough, urticarial rash, migratory infiltrates on chest radiography, and peripheral eosinophilia. Symptoms typically resolve spontaneously after 2 to 10 weeks. Schistosoma species that cause disease in humans are endemic in Asia and the Middle East. This patient did not have many of the presenting features of acute schistosomiasis and his syndrome had lasted longer than 10 weeks, and thus this diagnosis is unlikely.\nAcute larval migration (Loeffler\u2019s syndrome)\nis a self-limited illness caused by transpulmonary larval migration that occurs early in the normal life cycle of several helminths, including ascaris, hookworm, and strongyloides. Fever, cough, and urticarial rash begin within 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Marked peripheral eosinophilia can be present, and infiltrates may be seen on chest radiography. The illness lasts days to a few weeks and then symptoms abate; this disease course is not consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation. However, he had a positive serologic test for antibodies to strongyloides, a finding that con- stitutes evidence of a previous infection. Strongy- loidiasis is a common infection, with an esti- mated 100 million people infected worldwide.14 Strongyloides can persist for decades, so this patient most likely has chronic strongyloidiasis, which, in the absence of a hyperinfection syn- drome, would not explain his cough. The dura- tion of his cough and the absence of other symptoms make acute larval migration unlikely but possible. A negative examination of the stool for ova and parasites does not rule out these diagnoses.\nA high parasite burden caused by either toxo-\ncara or strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome can be associated with marked peripheral eo- sinophilia and cough due to deposition of larvae or eggs in the lungs. Some patients with acute toxocariasis (visceral larva migrans) have fever, cough, abdominal pain, wheezing, and marked peripheral eosinophilia.15 Acute toxocariasis is most commonly seen in young children and is acquired through the ingestion of contaminated soil, food, or raw meat. This patient\u2019s age and the absence of other symptoms and known expo- sures to toxocara make this diagnosis unlikely. Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome occurs in the presence of immunosuppression, particu- larly glucocorticoid use. This patient had none of the usual risk factors that would suggest stron- gyloides hyperinfection syndrome.14\nEchinococcus, which is a tapeworm in dogs, can cause lung cysts. This diagnosis is unlikely in this case, given the absence of abnormalities on radiography, the absence of exposure to dogs or livestock, and the magnitude of the eosino- philia.16,17\nParagonimus is a lung fluke that is transmit- ted through the ingestion of undercooked or raw freshwater crabs or crayfish. Paragonimiasis is most prevalent in East Asia, with an estimated 23 million people infected worldwide.18 Pulmo- nary manifestations include chronic cough, chest pain, and pleural effusion.11,12 Nearly all infected patients have marked eosinophilia and an elevat- ed IgE level. Chest radiography may show infil- trates, nodules, or pleural effusion, although it can have normal results. The diagnosis is made by means of visualization of the eggs on micros- copy of a sputum sample or serologic testing. The sensitivity of microscopy of the sputum is limited even with the use of multiple samples,11 so a negative examination does not rule out this diagnosis. Serologic testing has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of more than 95%.19 On the basis of the negative serologic test for anti- bodies to paragonimus, paragonimiasis is an unlikely cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms.\nTropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia\nTropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) is a hyper- sensitivity reaction to the filarial parasites Wuch- ereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi.20,21 Lymphatic filariasis affects an estimated 120 million peo- ple worldwide,22 in 83 countries, including most countries in Southeast Asia. Many infected pa- tients have no overt symptoms. TPE is a rare complication of lymphatic filariasis that devel- ops in less than 1% of patients infected by the filarial parasites.23 The diagnosis of TPE, which is typically made after months of symptoms, is often delayed because of its rarity.24 TPE is most commonly seen in persons of Indian or South- east Asian ancestry.24 Presenting symptoms can include cough (in 90% of patients), dyspnea, wheezing, and interstitial infiltrates or reticulonodular opacities on chest radiography (although results of imaging studies are normal in 20% of patients).\nDiagnostic criteria include a history of spend- ing time in an area in which the parasites are endemic, a peripheral eosinophil count of more than 3000 per cubic millimeter, a serum IgE level of more than 1000 IU per milliliter, the detection of antifilarial antibodies, and a rapid clinical response to treatment.20,24 Although this patient\u2019s illness does not perfectly fit the diag- nostic criteria, the duration of his symptoms, travel and habitation history, and marked eosino- philia are consistent with TPE. It is important to diagnose and treat TPE, because irreversible restrictive lung disease can develop in affected patients.\nTo establish the diagnosis of TPE, I would\nperform antibody-based tests for filariasis and examine a peripheral-blood smear for microfi- lariae. Because it would be difficult to rule out chronic strongyloidiasis in this patient, I would administer empirical ivermectin regardless of the results of additional testing. If the TPE work- up is unrevealing, I would obtain a computed tomographic scan of the chest and reconsider primary causes of pulmonary eosinophilic con- ditions and other helminthic infections.\nDr. Dudzinski: Dr. Hurtado, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this pa- tient?\nDr. Rocio M. Hurtado: The combination of marked peripheral eosinophilia, an elevated serum IgE level in the absence of a hypersensitivity syn- drome, and chronic cough in a South Asian man with an extensive travel history raised the pos- sibility of TPE and prompted further investiga- tions for this and other infectious causes. Of note, although TPE is found in less than 1% of patients with filarial infections, it is most com- monly found in males from the Indian subcon- tinent.25 We were also aware of the patient\u2019s positive serologic test for antibodies to strongy- loides, but the chronicity of his symptoms with- out convincing signs of progressive larval migra- tion or early hyperinfection syndrome prevented us from attributing his presentation exclusively to strongyloidiasis, although we could not fully rule out coinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis. We therefore elected to further investigate for lymphatic filariasis, given that we suspected a diagnosis of TPE.\n",

    "Key testing": "serum was tested for antibodies to schistosoma, strongyloides, and filarial species",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. K.C. Coffey: Examination of the stool and spu- tum for ova and parasites was negative on two occasions. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear for microfilariae was also negative.\nThe patient\u2019s serum was tested for antibodies to schistosoma, strongyloides, and filarial spe- cies. Testing for antifilarial antibodies was mark- edly positive (>510 \u03bcg per milliliter; positive range, >14). In conjunction with the clinical presentation, this finding is most consistent with filarial infection. However, the schistosoma and strongyloides assays were also positive, findings indicative of either cross-reactivity or coinfection. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for filarial species was performed at the National Institutes of Health. This assay detects IgG4 antibodies to a crude antigen derived from adult B. malayi. Extensive cross-reactivity among filarial antigens limits the ability to distinguish among filarial species and other helminths.26 The assay is unable to discriminate active infec- tion from previous infection (or from chronic exposure in populations who live in areas in which the parasites are endemic). Definitive diagnosis of filarial infection depends on direct de- tection of microfilariae in the blood. However, examination of a peripheral-blood smear is often negative in patients who present with TPE. This may be due to immunologic hyperresponsiveness, rapid opsonization, and clearance from the pe- ripheral circulation.20\nThe ELISA for strongyloides species was per- formed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This test detects IgG antibod- ies to a crude antigen derived from S. stercoralis filariform larvae. The sensitivity of this assay is approximately 95%,27 but the specificity is re- duced by cross-reactivity with filarial species and other nematodes. Although this patient\u2019s positive ELISA for strongyloides could indicate active infection, the test cannot distinguish active infection from previous infection or coinfec- tion with another nematode. The standard method for diagnosis is direct observation of filariform larvae that have been shed in feces (or in sputum in patients with strongyloides hyper- infection). Examination of the stool for parasites was negative on two occasions in this patient. However, only a small number of larvae are shed in the stool, so fecal smears can have low diag- nostic sensitivity, even with repeat examinations.27 The ELISA for schistosoma species was also performed at the CDC. This test detects antibod- ies to a purified Schistosoma mansoni adult micro- somal antigen in the presence of schistosoma infection; however, such antibodies might not develop until 6 to 8 weeks after exposure.28 The test is 99% sensitive for S. mansoni, 95% sensitive for S. haematobium, and less than 50% sensitive for S. japonicum29; these are the three schistoso- ma species that most commonly cause infection in humans. A positive test is followed by an im- munoblot assay for species identification. Anti- bodies can persist even after treatment and cannot indicate the degree of infection or the prognosis.30 In this patient, the ELISA was just within the positive range, and the species-spe- cific immunoblot assay was negative for the three species.\nTaken together, the serologic test results in this patient were most consistent with microfilarial infection. However, coinfection with strongyloides or schistosoma could not be ruled out.\n\n\n",
