    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Molly Wolf (Medicine and Pediatrics): A 17-year-old boy was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, because of chest pain, syncope, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, and elevated blood levels of creatine kinase and troponin T. The patient had been well until 5 days before this admission, when fever, nau- sea, diarrhea, muscle aches, and chest pain developed. The chest pain radiated to the left shoulder and was worse when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. One episode of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis occurred. On the second day of illness, the patient presented to his primary care clinic at another hospital, where a viral illness was diagnosed. An intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was adminis- tered, nebulized albuterol was prescribed, and the patient was advised to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen. During the next 3 days, fever and diarrhea resolved, but chest pain, muscle aches, and nausea persisted and were accompanied by decreased appetite and cold, pale fingers.\nOn the morning of admission, lightheadedness developed. When the patient stood to get a drink of water, he felt unsteady, his vision faded, and syncope oc- curred. He regained consciousness within 1 minute. Emergency medical services were called, and on arrival they found that the patient was alert and the vital signs were normal. The peripheral blood glucose level, obtained by fingerstick testing, was 24 mg per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Thiamine and 50 ml of a 50% dextrose solu- tion were administered intravenously, and the patient was transported by ambu- lance to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn arrival at the other hospital, the patient reported pleuritic left parasternal chest pain, which he rated at 4 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the pulse 106 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The pulse oximeter plethysmographic waveform was noted to be of low amplitude, and the oxygen saturation was difficult to obtain. The weight was 95.3 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32. The fingers were cool, with a capillary refill time of 3 to 4 seconds. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lac- tic acid were normal; other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1. Serum toxicologic screening was negative. Chest radiography re- vealed a borderline enlarged cardiac silhouette. ECG and echocardiography were performed.\nDr. Oscar J. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 100 beats per minute (Fig. 1). ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression were present in leads I and II and the lateral precordial leads. There was no atrial or ventricular ectopy.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and nor- mal left ventricular volume and systolic func- tion, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%; there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic func- tion were normal. There was no mitral valve prolapse, but mild mitral regurgitation was pres- ent. The aortic dimensions were within normal limits, and there was no pericardial effusion. Doppler imaging revealed normal systolic and diastolic velocities.\nDr. Wolf: Three hours after arrival, the patient\nwas transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that he had intentionally lost 45 kg of weight during the previous year. He took no medica- tions, herbal remedies, or nutritional supple- ments and had no known allergies. His immu- nizations were reportedly current. The patient lived with his mother and younger brother. He played sports; he had no known exposure to sick persons and was not sexually active. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His mother had hypertension, unspecified heart disease, and a history of recurrent miscarriages. A brother had died at 56 days of age from sud- den infant death syndrome. His maternal grand- mother had hypertension and diabetes, and a maternal aunt had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with nephritis.\nOn examination, the patient appeared  well.\nThe temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the pulse 111 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was receiv- ing supplemental oxygen through a nasal can- nula at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The fingers were cold and pale. Examination of the skin revealed striae on the abdomen. The re- mainder of the physical examination was nor- mal. Tests for influenza virus, respiratory syncy- tial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.031, a pH of 6.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous fluids, ibuprofen, and famotidine were adminis- tered, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued. During the next 24 hours, the chest pain and ECG abnormalities abated and the blood levels of creatine kinase, troponin T, alanine amino- transferase, and aspartate aminotransferase de- creased. The patient was discharged home; he was advised to take acetaminophen and ibupro- fen as needed for pain, and a follow-up appoint- ment with a pediatric cardiologist was scheduled. Ten days later, in the cardiology clinic, the pa- tient reported that the chest pain had resolved. He appeared well. The pulse was 86 beats per minute and the blood pressure 151/77 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was un- changed. Results of laboratory tests performed in the patient\u2019s primary care clinic 3 days earlier are shown in Table 1. ECG was performed.\nDr. Benavidez: An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 82 beats per minute (Fig. 1). There were nonspecific ST-segment changes in leads III and aVF; ST-segment elevation and PR- segment depression were no longer present.\nDr. Wolf: Ultrasonographic examination of the kidneys was normal. Amlodipine was prescribed, and follow-up appointments with a pediatric ne- phrologist and a medical geneticist were sched- uled but not kept by the patient. Results of labo- ratory tests performed in the primary care clinic 6 weeks after discharge are shown in Table 1.\nApproximately 9.5 months after admission to the pediatric ICU, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital with a 15-hour history of fever, malaise, nausea, vomit- ing, diarrhea, midsternal chest pain, and light- headedness. He rated the chest pain at 6 out of 10. The temperature was 39.3\u00b0C, the pulse 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 134/61 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. On examination, the capillary refill time in the fingers was 3 to 4 seconds. ECG and imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Benavidez: An ECG showed sinus tachycar- dia at a rate of 126 beats per minute (Fig. 1). There were frequent premature atrial and ventric- ular contractions, along with diffuse flattening of T waves.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: Frontal and lateral chest radi- ography revealed cardiomegaly, as characterized by an increased cardiothoracic ratio, with pre dominant enlargement of the left atrium (Fig. 2).Pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial pulmonary edema and a small left pleural effusion were detected; these findings are sug- gestive of congestive heart failure.\nDr. Wolf: The patient was again transferred by ambulance to the pediatric ICU of this hospital. On admission, he reported that the chest pain had abated. He appeared to be in no distress. The temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, the pulse 134 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/49 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breath- ing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg. On auscultation of the heart, the rhythm was ir- regular; the remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.027, a pH of 5.0, and 1+ protein. Intravenous f luids, magnesium sulfate, sodium phosphate, amlodipine, famotidine, ondansetron, acetamino- phen, and ibuprofen were administered.\nDuring the next 2 days, fever and intermittent chest pain persisted and hypertension developed, with blood-pressure measurements as high as 187/97 mm Hg. Hydralazine and labetalol were administered, and the dose of amlodipine was increased. On examination, strength in the prox- imal muscles of the arms and legs was graded as 4 out of 5, with 5 indicating normal muscular contraction against full resistance. There were episodes during which the fingers were cold and pale; no nailfold capillary abnormalities were seen. The remainder of the examination was unchanged.\nThe blood level of troponin T decreased to 0.57 ng per milliliter and the blood level of cre- atine kinase MB isoenzyme decreased to 50.2 ng per milliliter, whereas the blood level of creatine kinase increased to 8336 U per liter; the urine level of myoglobin was 283 \u03bcg per liter (refer- ence value, \u226421). The results of thyroid-function tests were normal. Some peripheral blood glu- cose measurements, obtained by fingerstick test- ing, were as low as 22 mg per deciliter (1.2 mmol per liter), despite a regular diet and the admin- istration of dextrose-containing intravenous flu- ids. These values were not verified by concurrent central venous blood glucose measurements.\n\nTable 1.

A lateral chest radiograph (Panel B) shows thick\u2011 ening of the major fissure (arrowhead), which is indica\u2011 tive of congestive heart failure, as well as left atrial en\u2011 largement (arrows), which is causing displacement of the left mainstem bronchus posteriorly and probably contributing to lower lobe atelectasis.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Puneeta Arya: This 17-year-old boy was admit- ted to this hospital twice within 9.5 months because of chest pain. The first episode of chest pain was accompanied by syncope, although the associated prodrome, the rapid resolution with- out intervention, and the absence of palpitations provide reassurance that the syncope did not have a cardiac cause. To construct a differential diagnosis, I will begin by defining the initial chest-pain syndrome and then consider how the remainder of his presenting symptoms and signs help to narrow the list of possible diagnoses.\n\nChest Pain\nThis patient reported that his chest pain was in the left parasternal region, radiated to the left shoulder, and worsened when he took deep breaths or was lying flat. These features suggest that the pain was pleuritic in nature and could have been due to pleuritis or pericarditis. The absence of a friction rub does not rule out peri- carditis. Friction rubs vary in intensity and can wax and wane over a period of hours; therefore, the sensitivity of auscultation for the detection of a friction rub also varies, depending in large part on how frequently auscultation is performed.1\nThe pattern of ST-segment elevation and PR-\nsegment depression observed on sequential ECGs in this patient is consistent with pericarditis. In patients with pericarditis, ECG findings evolve over time and typically progress through four stages. Stage 1 occurs in the first few hours to days and involves the presence of diffuse ST- segment elevation and PR-segment depression, with reciprocal ST-segment depression and PR- segment elevation in leads V1 and aVR. These findings are consistent with those seen on the ECG obtained when this patient initially pre- sented to the other hospital, on the day of the first admission. Stage 2 occurs in the first few days to the first week and involves resolution of the ST-segment and PR-segment abnormalities, which was seen on the ECG obtained when this patient attended a follow-up appointment in the cardiology clinic 10 days after discharge. Stage 3 occurs days to weeks after the onset of pericar- ditis and is characterized by diffuse T-wave in- versions. Stage 4 is normalization of the ECG.2\nThis patient had many ECG findings that\nwere consistent with a diagnosis of pericarditis, which suggests that inflammation of the pericar- dium is a key feature of his presenting illness. Of note, an echocardiogram obtained on the initial presentation did not show a pericardial effusion, but pericarditis can be present without an effusion. The elevated troponin T level is sug- gestive of myocardial inflammation,3,4 and the chest pain abated after the administration of ibuprofen. No regional wall-motion abnormali- ties were noted; these are seen in 30 to 40% of cases of myocarditis. With these features taken together, I would characterize his chest-pain syndrome as myopericarditis.\n\nMuscle Pain\nDuring the first admission, this patient had myal- gias and a markedly elevated blood level of cre- atine kinase. These findings are suggestive of muscle inflammation. The blood levels of ala- nine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotrans- ferase were also elevated, which could be due to hepatic inflammation. However, aspartate ami- notransferase is also secreted by skeletal mus- cles. In the context of prominent myalgias, these laboratory abnormalities are consistent with a diagnosis of myositis.\n\nInfection\nThe constellation of myopericarditis, fever, and myositis can be explained by an acute viral ill- ness. Many viruses can cause myocardial in- flammation and myositis, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (although this patient presented before the Covid-19 pan- demic), influenza virus, coxsackievirus, Epstein\u2013 Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, echovirus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, measles virus, HIV, and dengue virus. Tests for influenza virus, parain- fluenza virus, adenovirus, and HIV were nega- tive in this patient. In addition, he was likely to have been vaccinated against varicella\u2013zoster virus and measles virus and had no known epi- demiologic exposure to cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, or dengue virus.\nThe history of clinically significant weight loss during the past year is suggestive of a more chronic process. In addition, the echocardio- gram showed mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy without any evidence of left ven- tricular outflow tract obstruction or coarctation of the aorta, a finding consistent with long- standing hypertension. Several aspects of this patient\u2019s presentation would not be explained by an acute infectious illness, so I will consider other potential causes of myopericarditis.\nAutoimmune Disease\nMyopericarditis can be associated with autoim- mune disease, such as SLE, which can also cause fever and myositis. Autoimmune disease is an important consideration in this patient, given that his family history included recurrent mis- carriages and hypertension in his mother and SLE with nephritis in his maternal aunt. In ad- dition, two physical findings that were present in this patient point toward autoimmune dis- ease. First, peripheral blood glucose measure- ments indicated marked hypoglycemia, although there were no symptoms or signs of this condi- tion. This finding suggests the possibility of pseudohypoglycemia,5 a phenomenon in which glucose levels in blood from a peripheral vein are lower than glucose levels in blood from a central vein. Pseudohypoglycemia is caused by increased glucose extraction by the tissues in the presence of low capillary flow and by increased glucose transit time. Both increased extraction and increased transit time occur when excessive vasoconstriction develops as a result of either poor cardiac output or Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Second, a poor-quality plethysmographic trac- ing was observed in the presence of cool fingers with slow capillary refill. Although low cardiac output could explain both the pseudohypoglyce- mia and the poor plethysmographic tracing, this patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability and normal car- diac and pulmonary findings on physical exami- nation suggest that Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon is the more likely explanation, thereby increasing\n \nthe likelihood of an autoimmune disease. How- ever, it should be noted that this patient\u2019s history did not include triphasic color changes of the digits, which is a classic finding of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, and the physical examination was grossly unremarkable for changes suggestive of nailfold capillaritis.\n\nReframing the Initial Presentation\nThis patient\u2019s initial presentation can be re- framed as a 17-year-old boy with a family his- tory of autoimmune disease and a personal his- tory of clinically significant weight loss and hypertension who presented with myopericardi- tis, myositis, possible hepatitis, and possible Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon.6 However, autoimmune diseases often take months to years to com- pletely \u201cdeclare themselves\u201d clinically, and a de- finitive diagnosis can be difficult to make dur- ing the first encounter. Indeed, this patient was probably initially thought to have an infection that was causing myopericarditis, and he was discharged home with acetaminophen and ibu- profen for pain control and a follow-up appoint- ment with a cardiologist scheduled for 10 days after discharge.\n\nAdditional Information Obtained after the First Admission\nLaboratory testing performed 1 week and 6 weeks after discharge revealed anemia and lymphope- nia. In addition, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the blood levels of aspartate amino- transferase and alanine aminotransferase were increased. These findings are suggestive of in- flammation that persisted for 6 weeks after the first admission. It is unlikely that an acute viral illness would have persisted for this long. When the patient presented for the second admission,\n9.5\tmonths after the first admission, symmetric proximal muscle weakness had developed, along with a rising creatine kinase level and myoglo- binuria.7 These findings are suggestive of an inflammatory myopathy, such as polymyositis. Features of this patient\u2019s illness overlap with features of SLE (pericarditis, lymphopenia, and anemia), scleroderma (hypertension), and poly- myositis.8,9 This constellation of symptoms and signs that have evolved over the course of sev- eral months \u2014 including pericarditis or myocar- ditis, myositis, and possible Raynaud\u2019s phenom- enon \u2014 suggests an overlap syndrome such as mixed connective-tissue disease. I would recom- mend further evaluation, including testing for anti\u2013U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) antibodies and antinuclear antibodies (ANA), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and renovascular imaging.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Mandakolathur R. Murali: A serum autoantibody profile obtained during the second admission is summarized in Table 2. An indirect immuno- fluorescence assay performed on HEp-2 cells revealed a very high ANA titer (>1:5120) with a speckled nuclear pattern. This speckled pattern is seen with antibodies directed against nuclear constituents, such as the small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs), RNA-binding and DNA-binding pro- teins, helicase, and topoisomerase. A diffuse or homogeneous pattern would be expected with antibodies directed against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), deoxyribonucleoprotein, or histones.The negative test for anti-dsDNA antibodies and the absence of a homogeneous pattern in this patient suggests that the autoantibody is specific to snRNPs and not to a DNA\u2013histone complex. The snRNPs, RNA-binding and DNA-binding proteins, and helicases are soluble in normal saline and hence known as extractable nuclear antigens. Understanding the profile of extract- able nuclear antigens is the key to the diagnosis in this patient.\n\n\nTable 2.
