    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Mathew S. Lopes: A 65-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of chest pain.\nSix months before the current presentation, the patient presented to a hospital affiliated with this hospital with a 4-day history of acute pain in the lower back, left paraspinal muscles, and right flank. The pain worsened with movement and, to a lesser extent, with inspiration. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Mannudeep K. Kalra: A frontal radiograph of the chest (Fig. 1A) showed a spiculated nodule in the left lung, with left hilar prominence. Computed tomog- raphy (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol (Fig. 1B), revealed a spicu- lated nodule (1.7 cm in diameter) in the left upper lobe and left hilar lymphade- nopathy. There were bone lesions in the thoracic skeleton, including a lytic lesion (2.3 cm in diameter) at the level of the ninth thoracic vertebra. There was no evi- dence of pulmonary embolism. Positron-emission tomography and CT (PET-CT) revealed foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the mass in the left upper lobe, as well as in mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, the eighth transverse pro- cess, the ninth thoracic vertebral body, and the right ninth rib (Fig. 1C).\nA biopsy specimen of the lung mass showed evidence of lung adenocarcinoma with a mutation in KRAS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and spine did not reveal cerebral metastases but confirmed the presence of a lytic lesion at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae; a compression fracture was also observed.\nDr. Lopes: External-beam radiation therapy was administered during the next 2 weeks, followed by four cycles of carboplatin and pemetrexed that were com- pleted during the next 3 months.\nDr. Kalra: A repeat PET-CT scan obtained 2 weeks after completion of chemotherapy showed that the FDG-avid foci in the right ninth rib and in lymph nodes in the medi- astinum, hilum, and right supraclavicular re- gion had increased in size.\nDr. Lopes: Palliative external-beam radiation therapy was administered. Two weeks later, the patient was readmitted to the other hospital with increased back pain. CT of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous con- trast material, revealed atelectasis in the left up- per lobe. The patient was treated with external- beam radiation therapy, prednisone, supplemental oxygen, ipratropium in combination with albute- rol, and salmeterol in combination with flutica- sone, and she was discharged home 2 days later.\nTwo days after discharge, the patient presented to the other hospital with dyspnea and hypox- emia. CT of the chest, performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed complete collapse of the left upper lobe due to an obstructing endobronchial lesion. The patient received prednisone, inhaled albuterol, tiotropium, salmeterol in combination with fluti- casone, and five treatments of external-beam radiation therapy during a 7-day hospitalization. One week after discharge, a dose of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (3 mg per kilo- gram of body weight) was administered for the treatment of non\u2013small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the outpatient oncology clinic of the other hospital.\nThree weeks later, the back pain and dyspnea\nworsened, and anorexia and a sore throat devel- oped. Two days later, the patient had new pain in the left lateral chest wall. She described the pain as having a stabbing quality that was non- pleuritic, radiated from back to front, and worsened when she lay on her left side. After 2 days of chest pain, she was evaluated at the emer- gency department of the other hospital. Treatment with sublingual nitroglycerin did not reduce the chest pain. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 121 beats per minute and tenderness in the left precordium near the anterior axillary and midaxillary lines. An electrocardiogram report- edly did not show any ischemic changes. Labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A radio- graph of the chest reportedly showed left hilar opacity, atelectasis in the left upper lobe, and osteopenia. Aspirin was given orally, and mor- phine, hydromorphone, normal saline, and hepa- rin were administered intravenously. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for anorexia, fatigue, and constipation, but the patient had no fever, chills, dyspnea, cough, diaphoresis, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, or urinary urgency or frequency. The medical history included hypercholesterolemia, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gout, anxiety, and glaucoma; she had undergone kyphoplasty for osteoporosis, internal fixation for an ulnar fracture and radiopatellar dislocation, and when she was in her early 40s, ovary-sparing total abdominal hysterectomy for endometriosis. Medications included inhaled sal- meterol in combination with fluticasone, tiotro- pium, morphine sulfate (controlled release), bri- monidine, latanoprost, cholecalciferol, senna, docusate, omeprazole, oxycodone, and acetamin- ophen as needed for pain. Treatment with eryth- romycin caused stomach upset. She had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day from 30 years of age until the diagnosis of lung cancer was made, 6 months before the current presentation; she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was retired from working as an administrator. She was widowed, had three adult children, and was serving as a caregiver for her mother. Her father had had coronary artery disease, and her mother had lung cancer, osteoporosis for which she had undergone kyphoplasty, and spinal ste- nosis for which she had undergone laminectomy. The temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate\n116 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/65  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  20  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She ap- peared cachectic and was uncomfortable with movement. The jugular venous pressure was 5 cm of water. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, but no cardiac murmur or rub was noted. There was tenderness on palpation of the left and right lateral chest wall. Diminished breath sounds were noted on the left side, with crackles at the left apex. A faint erythematous rash was present at the site of radiation therapy on the left upper back. The patient had no swelling or palpable cords in the legs. The remainder of the examina- tion was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram (Fig.  2)  showed sinus tachycardia, a rightward axis, and minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes. Telem- etry revealed intermittent premature ventricular contractions. Laboratory testing revealed nor- mal levels of magnesium, phosphorus, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, lipase, lactic acid, and thyrotropin; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood samples were obtained for culture.\nDr. Kalra: A frontal radiograph of the chest (Fig. 3A) showed an elevated left hilum with adjacent opacity, findings that were consistent with a collapsed left upper lobe. Dual-energy CT of the chest (Fig. 3B), performed after the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material accord- ing to a pulmonary embolism protocol, revealed a low-attenuation lesion (measuring 2 cm in diam- eter) at the left hilum that was consistent with the patient\u2019s known lung cancer, but there was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The lesion caused complete occlusion of the bronchus of the left upper lobe at its origin, with obstructive collapse of the left upper lobe. In addition, patchy consolidation was noted in an adjacent area of the left lower lobe. There were multiple lytic le- sions in the thoracic skeleton, with the largest lesions seen in the eighth thoracic vertebra and the ninth right rib. The imaging also revealed multiple sites of previous vertebroplasty in the lower thoracic spine.\nDr. Lopes: Atorvastatin, levofloxacin, metopro- lol, and intravenous hydromorphone and mor- phine were administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology service. A transtho- racic echocardiogram showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 57%; there was subtle hypo- kinesis in the mid-inferior, basal inferior, and basal inferoseptal walls, mild-to-moderate tri- cuspid regurgitation, and no evidence of pericar- dial effusion, and the size and function of the right ventricle were normal.\nFigure 1. Initial Imaging Studies of the Chest, Obtained before the Lung Cancer Diagnosis.\nA frontal radiograph (Panel A) shows a nodule in the left midlung zone (arrow), with left hilar prominence. A transverse CT image (Panel B) confirms the presence of an irregular nodule in the left upper lobe (arrowhead) and left hilar lymphadenopathy (arrow). A transverse positron\u2011emission tomographic and CT image (Panel C) shows a high level of 18F\u2011fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity in the nodule in the left upper lobe (white arrow\u2011 head) and in the region of left hilar lymphadenopathy (arrow). There is also intense FDG uptake in the eighth thoracic vertebra that is suggestive of bony metastatic disease (black arrowhead).\n\nTable 1.

The troponin T level continued to rise, reaching 1.08 ng per milliliter. On the sixth hospital day, ST-segment depressions were more pronounced in the inferolateral leads, and coro- nary angiography was performed; there was minimal nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Treatment with methylprednisolone was initiated at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram; however, on the eighth hospital day, complete atrioventricular block developed, with an idioventricular escape rhythm, and the troponin T level reached 1.68 ng per milliliter. \n\nFigure 3.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Timothy E. Guiney: This patient presents with chest pain 6 months after she has received a diagnosis of KRAS-positive lung adenocarcinoma that has metastasized from the lung to the medi- astinum, vertebrae, and ribs. She has had com- plete collapse of the left upper lobe due to an obstructing endobronchial lesion, for which she has received palliative radiation therapy to the chest.1 She has also received treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab owing to progression of the cancer, despite having pre- viously received platinum-based chemotherapy.2 She is admitted to the cardiology unit because of chest pain and an elevated troponin T level. In addition to reviewing this patient\u2019s history and findings on physical examination, it is important to determine the goals of care for this patient, because they may inform the most appropriate clinical strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of her chest pain.\nMyocardial Ischemia\nThe first step in the evaluation of this patient is to determine whether the chest pain and elevat- ed troponin T level are due to myocardial ische- mia that is causing an acute coronary syndrome. The manifestations of acute coronary syndrome may be different in women than in men,3 and therefore, a thorough evaluation of this patient\u2019s history, risk factors, and findings on physical examination is critical to establish this diagno- sis. The most common cause of troponin release is low-level injury to the myocardium. This patient probably has some coronary disease, given her multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis, in- cluding family history, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking. Her history of hysterectomy would be a relevant risk factor for cardiovascular disease if she had had surgically induced menopause,but her ovaries were spared. She has also re- ceived radiation therapy to the chest, but given that this treatment was administered recently, the possibility that it contributed to the develop- ment of atherosclerosis is unlikely.\nFurthermore, the patient describes chest pain that has lasted for several days, is located main- ly in the lateral chest, and has a stabbing qual- ity and a positional component. There was tenderness on palpation at the site of the chest pain, and the pain seems to be unresponsive to conventional treatment for ischemia, such as nitrates. The echocardiogram suggests a subtle area of hypokinesis in the mid-inferior, basal inferior, and basal inferoseptal walls, but elec- trocardiography does not indicate obstruction in either this territory or any other coronary territory. When mild coronary obstruction is present, sustained tachycardia may cause a mis- match in the recently increased myocardial oxy- gen demand relative to the available coronary blood supply, and ischemia can result in myo- cardial injury and troponin release. On the basis of the description and time course of the chest pain, I do not think it is due to atherosclerosis, despite the elevated troponin T level. Additional considerations include other ischemic chest pain syndromes that may be more common in women than in men, such as vasospasm (which is more likely to last for minutes than days) and spontaneous coronary artery dissection.4 Since none of the ischemic chest pain syndromes provide a unifying diagnosis in this case, other noncoronary causes of chest pain should be considered.\nPericarditis\nThis patient\u2019s history and examination findings indicate that she probably does not have pleu- ritic pain. If she had pleuritic pain on the left side and lay on her left side, the pain would feel somewhat better. Instead, we are told that her pain increases in this position. There is also no history of classic pericarditic pain, which is characterized by an increase in pain when the patient is in a reclined position and a decrease in pain when the patient is seated upright. Her chest pain has occurred in the absence of a peri- cardial rub, although this sign can be transient, and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion on the transthoracic echocardiogram. In addi-\n \ntion, she does not have the characteristic PR- segment depression and ST-segment elevation that are often seen on an electrocardiogram when pericarditis is present. Therefore, a diag- nosis of pericarditis seems unlikely in this case.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\nCancer is a risk factor for venous thromboembo- lism, and this patient presents with chest pain, dyspnea, and unexplained tachycardia. In the context of cancer, an elevated d-dimer level can indicate activation of the clotting cascade. Eleva- tion of the d-dimer level does not necessarily imply thrombosis,5 and in fact, no evidence of pulmonary embolism is identified on CT. The jugular venous pressure is not elevated and the level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic pep- tide is low, findings that indicate the absence of ventricular strain.\n\nParenchymal Lung Disease\nThis patient has diminished breath sounds in the left lung, which suggests a pathologic pro- cess between the aerated lung and the stetho- scope. This finding could indicate a pleural ef- fusion or damage of the lung from cancer or pneumonia. The crackles present at the left apex on lung auscultation arouse concern about further obstruction of the bronchus of the left upper lobe. The examination findings correlate with the known obstruction of the left upper lobe, and pain associated with an obstruction in such a location would typically be pleuritic. However, this patient\u2019s pain is nonpleuritic, and there was tenderness on palpation of the lateral chest walls, with greater tenderness on the left side than on the right, which suggests that the metas- tases to the ribs could be increasing in size and becoming more painful. However, neither of these processes can explain the elevated troponin T level.\nMyocarditis\nOne possible explanation to account for this pa- tient\u2019s elevated troponin T level is the treatment she received to control her cancer. Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against pro- grammed death 1 (PD-1) receptor, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor; it functions by blocking immune-suppressing ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 from interacting with PD-1 (or the PD-1 receptor) to restore T-cell function and an effective immune response. However, activation of the immune sys- tem may be associated with an immune-related adverse event such as myocarditis, although this event would be uncommon.6,7 Myocarditis can result in protean symptoms, such as dyspnea and chest pain. Myocarditis associated with the use of an immune checkpoint inhibitor can lead to arrhythmias, heart block, cardiogenic shock, or death.8 I suspect that the most likely diagno- sis in this case is myocarditis resulting from treatment with nivolumab. Myocarditis accounts for all the signs and symptoms described in this patient and also explains the elevated troponin T level in the absence of ischemic disease.\nTo guide our approach to diagnosis and further treatment, input from the patient is critical. Her cancer has spread despite the use of chemo- therapy and has had only a marginal response to radiation therapy. Given her poor cancer progno- sis, t is important to have a candid conversation with the patient about options for the diagnosis and treatment of any cardiac disease. The first option would be to rule out the diagnosis of coronary disease, which we could accomplish by performing coronary angiography; however, cor- onary interventions are probably not an option in this case because of the presence of progres- sive metastatic cancer. The second option would be to establish the diagnosis of myocarditis, which we could accomplish by performing a myocar- dial biopsy; however, this procedure is invasive and may be associated with complications. Car- diac MRI may be very difficult to perform while the patient has clinically significant pain that limits her ability to lie f lat. The third option would be to take no immediate action and care- fully watch and wait for the situation to declare itself. Pursuing the diagnosis of myocarditis might be worthwhile, since high doses of gluco- corticoids have been shown to be beneficial in a small number of cases of myocarditis associated with the use of an immune checkpoint inhibi- tor.8 Logic suggests that early diagnosis should offer the best possibility of reversal.\n\n\n",
