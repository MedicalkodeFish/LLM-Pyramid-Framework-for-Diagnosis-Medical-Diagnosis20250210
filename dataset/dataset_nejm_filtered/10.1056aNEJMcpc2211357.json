    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jarone Lee: A 55-year-old man was admitted to this hospital 7 months after kid- ney transplantation because of fatigue, weight loss, and new pulmonary nodules. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 week before this admis- sion, when severe fatigue and generalized weakness developed. He had lost 4.5 kg in the past month after making healthier dietary choices; however, he had also\nnoticed abdominal discomfort and a decrease in appetite.\nDuring the next week, the patient was able to eat and drink very little and lost an additional 4.5 kg. The fatigue and weakness worsened, and he mostly stayed in bed. He had several episodes of lightheadedness, gait instability, and falls while he was walking to the bathroom. There was new odynophagia, dysphagia, and nausea.\nOn the day of admission, the patient was evaluated at the transplant nephrol- ogy clinic of this hospital before a scheduled infusion of belatacept. The tempera- ture was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 70/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared cachectic and lethargic. He was transported by ambulance from the clinic to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported malaise and feeling like he had no energy or strength. The lightheadedness and gait instability persisted. A review of systems was notable for shortness of breath, dark urine, and continued anorexia, nausea, odynophagia, dysphagia, and abdominal discomfort. He re- ported no chills, night sweats, cough, chest pain, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, or dysuria.\nThe patient had a history of sarcoidosis. Nine years before this admission, nephrocalcinosis caused end-stage kidney disease. Hemodialysis was started, and this treatment was continued until a deceased-donor kidney transplantation was performed 7 months before this admission. Routine serologic testing performed before transplantation was positive for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomega- lovirus (CMV) IgG. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serologic testing in the donor was also positive for EBV IgG but was negative for CMV IgG. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin was initiated; mainte- nance therapy included prednisone, mycopheno- late mofetil, and tacrolimus.\nSix months before the current admission, pathological examination of a biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed vascular disease of donor origin and acute tubular injury but no evidence of T-cell\u2013mediated or antibody- mediated rejection. Treatment with tacrolimus was stopped and belatacept started; prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil therapy was continued.\nOne month before the current admission, path- ological examination of another biopsy specimen from the transplanted kidney revealed focal in- filtrates that were vaguely granulomatous and were associated with ruptured tubules and inter- stitial Tamm\u2013Horsfall protein (also known as uromodulin). There was no evidence of allograft rejection.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, laboratory tests revealed a blood creatinine level of 2.31 mg per deciliter (204.2 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53.0 to 132.6 \u03bcmol per liter]); routine labora- tory tests had revealed similar creatinine levels during the previous 6 months. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nThe patient also had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gout. Current medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, labetalol, nifedip- ine, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganci- clovir, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and belatacept. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his mother in an urban area of New England and had never traveled outside the region. He worked as an administra- tor and had never been homeless or incarcerated. He had no sexual partners and did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol.\nOn the day of evaluation in the emergency department, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.5. The patient was lethargic and spoke in sentences of three or four words. The mucous membranes were\n \ndry, and the throat could not be evaluated be- cause of nausea. There was no cervical lymph- adenopathy. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse inspiratory crackles. Neurologic exami- nation was limited but was notable for 4/5 motor strength in the arms and legs.\nThe blood level of creatinine was 5.05 mg per deciliter (446.4 \u03bcmol per liter), the calcium level\n13.1 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; refer- ence range, 8.5  to 10.5  mg per deciliter [2.1 to\n2.6 mmol per liter]), the lactic acid level 4.4 mmol per liter (39.6 mg per deciliter; reference range,\n0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18.0 mg per deci- liter]), and the hemoglobin level 6.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). Cultures of blood were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Mark C. Murphy: Computed tomography\n(CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was per- formed without the administration of intrave- nous contrast material. CT of the chest (Fig. 1) revealed innumerable bilateral miliary pulmonary nodules that were new relative to a CT scan that had been obtained 6 months earlier. The nodules were in a random distribution that was sugges- tive of a hematogenous origin. Trace bilateral pleural effusions were present, as was calcified mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; the lymphadenopathy appeared unchanged from previous imaging. CT of the spleen (Fig. 2) re- vealed new splenomegaly. There was new mild dilatation of the renal collecting system of the transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.\nDr. Lee: While the patient was being evaluated\nin the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.6\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids and intra- venous infusion of phenylephrine were adminis- tered. Empirical treatment with vancomycin, ce- fepime, metronidazole, levofloxacin, doxycycline, and micafungin was started; trimethoprim\u2013sul- famethoxazole and valganciclovir were continued. Treatment with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and hydrocortisone therapy was started. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nWithin 24 hours after admission, the oxygen saturation had decreased to 84% while the pa- tient was breathing ambient air; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 94%. Continuous intra-venous infusion of phenylephrine was contin-\nued, and norepinephrine was added to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mm Hg. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. The creatinine level decreased to 3.82 mg per deciliter (337.7 \u03bcmol per liter), the lactic  acid level to 1.6 mmol per liter (14.4 mg per deciliter), and the calcium level to 8.9 mg  per  deciliter (2.2 mmol per liter). Treatment with levofloxacin and micafungin was stopped; isavuconazole was started.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Matthew B. Roberts: This 55-year-old man with a history of sarcoidosis and end-stage kidney dis- ease, for which he underwent kidney transplanta- tion, presented with a progressive and fulminant clinical syndrome that is notable for fever, pul- monary nodules, splenomegaly, and hypercalce- mia \u2014 findings that will form the basis of my differential diagnosis. Because this patient is a kidney-transplant recipient, I will also construct a differential diagnosis in the context of his net state of immune suppression and the described timeline of infections after solid-organ transplan- tation.1,2 Given that pulmonary nodules are a prominent finding in this case, I will discuss potential causes of pulmonary nodules before narrowing the differential diagnosis by consider- ing the patient\u2019s other pertinent features \u2014 sple- nomegaly and hypercalcemia.\nPulmonary Nodules\nThe development of pulmonary nodules is a rela- tively common problem after solid-organ trans- plantation and frequently prompts an infectious diseases consultation. Pulmonary nodules are of- ten the first feature identified in many unwell immunosuppressed patients, including solid-organ transplant recipients, and the lungs are usually the most accessible site for obtaining diagnostic samples.\nUnfortunately, pulmonary nodules can have many causes, and radiologic features can be non- specific.3 This patient\u2019s presentation includes fever, which necessitates consideration of infectious causes of pulmonary nodules. Common bacte- rial infections are unlikely to cause pulmonary nodules and rarely manifest with discrete small nodules, but uncommon pathogens such as legio- nella or nocardia may produce this radiologic appearance. This patient is receiving trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, which makes no- cardia a relatively unlikely cause, although break- through infection despite prophylaxis can occur.4 Bacterial endocarditis on the right side of the heart can cause septic pulmonary emboli; how- ever, this patient has no risk factors for endocar- ditis, no suggestive clinical signs such as a murmur, and no evidence of peripheral emboli. Furthermore, the large number of pulmonary nodules is not consistent with a diagnosis  of endocarditis. Mycobacterial infections, including infections with M. tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, often cause pulmonary nodules that are consistent with the clinical and radiologic\nfeatures observed in this patient.5\nFungal infections are important opportunistic infections to consider in transplant recipients.1 This patient underwent  kidney  transplantation 7 months before this admission and is probably having increasing environmental exposures as he experiences life without dialysis, meaning that he is at high risk for fungal infection.1 Fungal infec- tions frequently cause pulmonary nodules; com- monly encountered organisms include aspergillus species, mucorales, and endemic fungi such as Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, and coccidioides. It is important to consider Pneumo- cystis jirovecii infection in any immunocompromised host with pulmonary symptoms; however, this is an unlikely diagnosis in a patient who is receiv- ing trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole prophylax- is, which is highly effective in preventing pneumo- cystis pneumonia.6\nViral infections that warrant consideration in this patient include infections with CMV, herpes simplex virus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, influenza A or B viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). All these viruses can cause a systemic illness with pneumonitis. How- ever, the radiologic features of pulmonary nodules are not typical of these diagnoses. Furthermore, this patient presents with profound hypotension, which is not suggestive of a viral cause. In addi- tion, the patient is taking valganciclovir, which  is highly effective in preventing herpesvirus in- fections.7\nGiven the patient\u2019s history of sarcoidosis, this diagnosis must be considered, since sarcoidosis can cause pulmonary nodules. Cancer is a com- mon cause of pulmonary nodules; however, the patient has no smoking history, which makes lung cancer unlikely. Post-transplantation lym- phoproliferative disorder (PTLD) warrants con- sideration in this patient, although his positive EBV test before transplantation does not support this diagnosis because it occurs more commonly in solid-organ transplant recipients after new infection with EBV.1 It is possible that the patient has metastatic lesions that are not of pulmonary origin; however, a primary cancer was not iden- tified elsewhere on imaging.\nSplenomegaly\nThe presence of splenomegaly in this patient is an important factor in further narrowing the dif- ferential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules. Infec- tions such as tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacterial and H. capsulatum infections remain possible diagnoses. Among the noninfectious causes of pulmonary nodules that are likely in this patient, only sarcoidosis and PTLD are as- sociated with splenomegaly.\n\nHypercalcemia\nDoes the finding of hypercalcemia help to further refine the differential diagnosis? Hypercalcemia has many possible causes, but very few are associ- ated with concurrent pulmonary nodules and splenomegaly. Granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, and tuberculosis are associated with hypercalcemia.8-10 The mechanism is postulated to be related to a high serum cal- citriol level that may be due to overproduction by granulomas.10-12 PTLD has also been associated with hypercalcemia, although less frequently than granulomatous diseases.13 This patient\u2019s imaging shows no evidence of extrapulmonary lymphade- nopathy, which makes PTLD an unlikely diag- nosis. After factoring in the finding of hyper- calcemia, we are left with three diagnoses with overlapping pathological and clinical features: sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis, and tuberculosis. All three conditions are capable of mimicking each other.\n\nDifferentiation of Granulomatous Diseases\nSarcoidosis\nSarcoidosis is a multiorgan granulomatous dis- ease that frequently causes pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and hypercalcemia. This patient has a history of mul- tiorgan sarcoidosis predominantly involving the lung and kidney. Typically, sarcoidosis is treated with immunosuppression.14 Despite the fact that immunosuppression is administered to prevent kidney allograft rejection, sarcoidosis recurs after kidney transplantation in up to 27% of persons.15 Recurrence of sarcoidosis after transplantation is rarely fulminant and is often detected on bi- opsy in asymptomatic patients.15\n\nHistoplasmosis\nHistoplasmosis is caused by infection with H. cap- sulatum. The clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic pulmonary nodules to fulminant disseminated disease with rapidly progressive fever, fatigue, pulmonary  nodules,  splenomeg- aly, and hypercalcemia. Disseminated disease is most   common   in   immunosuppressed   persons.16\nH. capsulatum is a fungus that is endemic world- wide, but it is hyperendemic in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys.17 The incidence of diag- nosed histoplasmosis in the United States over- all is 3.4 cases per 100,000 persons; however, in the northeastern United States, the incidence is only 1.1 cases per 100,000 persons.18 In New England, where this patient lives, the incidence is very low among persons who have not traveled outside the region.19 The overall incidence of histoplasmosis after transplantation is approxi- mately 0.1% in the United States.20 Histoplasmo- sis that develops after transplantation can occur as a result of new primary infection, donor-derived transmission, or rarely, reactivation of previous infection.16\n\nTuberculosis\nTuberculosis is one of the most common infec- tions worldwide and is a major cause of death. Owing to a concerted public health effort over the course of many decades, the incidence in the United States is very low \u2014 at approximately 2.2 cases per 100,000 persons \u2014 and typically occurs in persons who have resided in a region outside the United States where the disease is endemic.21 The post-transplantation incidence overall is be- tween 1.2% and 6.4% in high-income countries.22 The clinical presentation can vary, but among solid-organ transplant recipients (such as this patient), 16% present with disseminated tuber- culosis.5 The majority of cases will occur within  1 year after transplantation and can be caused  by reactivation of latent tuberculosis, newly ac- quired tuberculosis after transplantation, or do- nor-derived tuberculosis.23\nIn this case, we can rule out sarcoidosis, given\nthat this patient\u2019s presentation is fulminant rath- er than indolent. Despite having a consistent clinical syndrome, the patient has no clear risk factors for either histoplasmosis or tuberculosis; therefore, donor-derived infection must be con- sidered.\n\nDonor-Derived Infection\nIn any unwell solid-organ transplant recipient, the epidemiologic exposures of the recipient must be considered, but so must the exposures of the donor. Donor-derived diseases are an important cause of post-transplantation death and compli- cations.24 Potential organ donors are screened extensively for transmissible diseases through questionnaires (in living donors) and laboratory screening tests, primarily to identify and man- age any potential bloodborne infections such as infections with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. However, other donor-derived diseases, including cancer, can occur, as can other infections such as histoplasmosis and tuberculosis.25 Deceased organ donors are not routinely screened for latent tu- berculosis infection or for histoplasmosis be- cause there is usually insufficient time to allow for such screening.\n\nWe are provided with no information about the epidemiologic exposures of the donor; the absence of such information is not uncommon in clinical practice. However, there are data to guide clinicians. A 10-year review of the incidence of donor-derived diseases after solid-organ trans- plantation in the United States showed that tu- berculosis accounted for 4% of all donor-derived infections.24 This review also showed that donor- derived tuberculosis occurred up to 148 days after transplantation, whereas donor-derived histo- plasmosis occurred within 90 days after trans- plantation.24\nIn this patient who had no risk factors for tuberculosis, the clinical syndrome of a progres- sive, fulminant illness with fever, innumerable pulmonary nodules, splenomegaly, and hyper- calcemia occurring 7 months after kidney trans- plantation is most likely due to donor-derived infection with M. tuberculosis. Some patients may have risk factors for tuberculosis that are not identified initially, and once such risk factors are identified, a thorough requestioning of the pa- tient is needed. To establish a diagnosis of tu- berculosis, I would obtain pulmonary specimens for an acid-fast bacilli smear, nucleic acid ampli- fication testing, and culture. I would begin the investigation by obtaining an induced sputum sample but would rapidly pursue bronchoscopy and biopsy of a pulmonary nodule if acid-fast staining and nucleic acid amplification testing are negative. I would evaluate concurrently for several of the diagnoses discussed previously, given the critical nature of this patient\u2019s presen- tation and the possibility that an immunocom- promised host may have multiple coexisting dis- eases at the time of presentation.\n",
