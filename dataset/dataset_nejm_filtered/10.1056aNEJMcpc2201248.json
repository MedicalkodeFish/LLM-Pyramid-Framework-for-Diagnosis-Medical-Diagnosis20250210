    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Rachel M. Erdil (Medicine): A 58-year-old woman was evaluated in the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of fatigue, abdominal bloating, and eosino- philia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 8 months before the current evaluation, when she fell and injured her right leg while hiking in a rain- forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Before this injury, she had been traveling throughout the DRC for 1 month. She had hiked, walked barefoot, and gone swimming in freshwater lakes and rivers.\nApproximately 55 hours after the fall, the patient was transported to the trauma center of a regional hospital. Imaging studies revealed fractures of the right tibia with associated hemorrhage. Packed red cells were transfused, and an external fixation device was placed. Once the patient\u2019s condition was stable, she was trans- ferred to a hospital in the United States.\nAt the second hospital, the eosinophil count was 3530 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 400); the eosinophil count had been normal 18 months earlier. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. One week after the fall, open reduc- tion and internal fixation of the fracture was performed. The patient started physical therapy and was discharged home.\nThe patient had persistent weight gain and mild fatigue, which had developed 4 years before the current presentation. She had associated these symptoms with the onset of menopause. However, after the traumatic leg injury, she noticed that the symptoms increased in severity. One month before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s weight had increased by 8.6 kg since the leg injury, and she took a 1-hour nap every afternoon because of fatigue. In addition, she had new abdominal bloat- ing that did not abate with the use of probiotics. The patient sought evaluation at a clinic associated with the second hospital. On evaluation, the results of blood tests for thyroid, kidney, and liver function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes. A test for Lyme disease was negative. The results of testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)\u2013specific antibodies and other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient moved to New England and established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. She continued to receive physical therapy for rehabilitation of the right leg. She reported that the weight gain, fatigue, and abdominal bloat- ing had worsened at a rapid rate; her weight had increased by 13.6 kg since the leg injury. The patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital.\nThe patient had a history of chronic migraines and hyperlipidemia. Review of systems was nota- ble for mild cough and swelling of the right knee that began after the surgery. She had no fever, hot flashes, night sweats, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash. Current medications included levothyroxine and probiotics. There were no known allergies. The patient had previously traveled to the south- western United States, North and East Africa,\n \nwestern Europe, and South and Southeast Asia. She currently lived in a suburban area of New England with her husband and cats in a house that had mold. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient  air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.9. She appeared well. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the  abdomen was soft and nontender; there was no hepato- megaly or lymphadenopathy. The right knee and leg had healed surgical scars. The skin examina- tion was normal.\nThe eosinophil count was 1760 per microliter. Tests for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and strongyloidiasis were nega- tive. The urinalysis was normal. Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Fig. 1), per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed calcified, nonenlarged subcarinal lymph nodes, along with calcified le- sions in the right lung, liver, and spleen, find- ings suggestive of granulomatous disease. There was also a low-attenuation hepatic lesion mea- suring 1.6  cm in diameter, which was probably  a cyst.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Natasha S. Hochberg: This patient was referred to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital because of moderate eosinophilia associated with travel, most recently to the DRC, where she had sustained a traumatic fracture of the right leg. Other exposures included walking barefoot, swimming in freshwater, spending time by rivers, and receiving a blood transfusion. Her current symptoms are notable for progressive fatigue, abdominal bloating, weight gain, and mild cough. Eosinophilia affects 8 to 9% of returning travelers1,2 and is a common reason for patients to be referred to an infectious disease clinic. I will focus my differential diagnosis on the find- ing of eosinophilia, considering both noninfec- tious and infectious causes (Table 2), and then concentrate specifically on helminthic infections.\nNoninfectious Causes of Eosinophilia Medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflamma- tory drugs and various antibiotic drugs can be associated with eosinophilia. This patient was taking levothyroxine, which is not typically asso- ciated with eosinophilia. Hematologic diseases, cancers, allergies, asthma, and rheumatologic diseases can also cause eosinophilia. However, these conditions are unlikely in the absence of findings such as lymphadenopathy, hepatospleno- megaly, anemia, an abnormal white-cell or plate- let count, and allergic symptoms. Adrenal insuf- ficiency can cause eosinophilia, as well as fatigue and low-normal blood pressure, but this condi- tion is unlikely in a patient with weight gain; weight loss and anorexia would be expected.\nThe six hypereosinophilic syndromes are characterized by an eosinophil count of greater than 1500 per microliter, but these syndromes involve organ dysfunction, which was not pres- ent in this patient.3 Episodic angioedema with eosinophilia, also known as Gleich\u2019s syndrome, is characterized by waxing and waning angio- edema, urticaria, fever, and weight gain4; only eosinophilia and weight gain were present in this patient.\nInfectious Causes of Eosinophilia\nNonhelminthic Infections\nThis patient was tested for EBV infection as part of the evaluation of worsening fatigue. The pat- tern of EBV-specific antibodies seen in this pa- tient is consistent with either recent EBV infec- tion or reactivated EBV infection due to another illness. There is a hypereosinophilic syndrome associated with an EBV-infected T-cell clone, but this condition is extremely rare.5 EBV-associated lymphoma is unlikely in the absence of lesions identified on CT. Chronic active EBV infection would typically cause fever and lymphadenopa- thy.6 Although recent EBV infection is possible, it would not explain several key features of this patient\u2019s presentation, including the persistent eosinophilia, which is more likely to be due to another infectious disease, and the weight gain. Among the nonhelminthic infections that can cause eosinophilia, coccidioidomycosis is a possibility in this patient, given that she had traveled to the southwestern United States. The presence of calcified lymph nodes on CT would be consistent with previous histoplasmosis or tuberculosis,  but  she  did  not have  findings or risk factors that would suggest reactivation of these infections.\nHelminthic Infections\nGiven this patient\u2019s extensive travel in urban and remote regions of Africa and Asia, helminthic infection is the most likely cause of her eosino- philia. Helminthic infections account for 14 to 64% of cases of eosinophilia in returning travel- ers.7-9 Assessment of the degree and timing of eosinophilia, the symptoms, the history of expo- sures, and the location of travel may provide clues to help narrow the differential diagnosis.\nThe extent and duration of eosinophilia can help determine the cause of illness.1,9,10 During this patient\u2019s evaluation at the second hospital, 8 months before the current presentation, she had an eosinophil count of 3530 per microliter, which is considered to be moderate eosinophilia (defined as an eosinophil count of 3000 to 5000 per microliter, although the definition varies). At the time of the current presentation, her eosino- phil count was still elevated but had decreased somewhat. Because eosinophilia can be caused by parasite migration through tissue, the elevat- ed eosinophil count for 8 months suggests the continued migration of organisms, which can occur with liver and lung fluke disease, filarial infection, visceral larva migrans, hookworm in- fection, trichinellosis, and selected other hel- minthic infections.11 By contrast, when organ- isms have migrated to the gastrointestinal tract or have become encysted, the eosinophil count may be only slightly elevated or normal.\nSymptoms may not occur until the helminth reaches its anatomical destination, so knowl- edge of incubation periods can be useful. Asca- riasis and hookworm infection have incubation periods of 2 to 3 weeks, and fluke infections such as schistosomiasis and fascioliasis have\n \nincubation periods of a few months; these diag- noses are unlikely in this patient. She had mild, nonspecific symptoms after 8 months. There- fore, helminthic infections that have a long in- cubation period, such as some filarial infec- tions, are more likely.\nAn evaluation for systemic, neurologic, oph- thalmologic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic symptoms and signs of helminthic infections (Table 3) would be indicated in this patient, with the understanding that some man- ifestations may not have developed yet. The pa- tient had cough, which could reflect parasite migration through the lungs. However, transient L\u00f6ffler\u2019s syndrome (due to Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, or Strongyloides stercoralis) and tropi- cal pulmonary eosinophilia (due to a response to microfilariae in the lungs) are unlikely in this patient; the lung examination was normal, and CT of the chest did not reveal opacities, consoli- dation, nodules, or septal thickening. Alterna- tively, her cough could reflect acute schistoso- miasis. However, symptoms such as wheezing and dyspnea usually appear approximately 3 to 4 weeks after exposure, and findings on chest imaging such as ground-glass opacities can be seen.12 At least half of patients with acute schistosomiasis have fever, and some have acute cercarial derma- titis and weight loss; the absence of these fea- tures makes this diagnosis unlikely in this patient. Furthermore, schistosomiasis is not necessarily associated with prolonged eosinophilia.\nThe patient\u2019s exposures included walking barefoot, which suggests the possibility of hook- worm infection, S. stercoralis infection, or visceral larva migrans due to Toxocara canis or possibly\nT. cati. However, prolonged eosinophilia would not be expected with these conditions, and com- patible symptoms were absent. Exposure to freshwater is associated with schistosomiasis, but we have established that this diagnosis is unlikely in this patient. Mosquito and other in- sect bites, which are very likely to occur in the remote regions where this patient had traveled, make filarial infections possible. Travel near rivers in the DRC introduces the possibility of black fly bites and Onchocerca volvulus exposure. Blood trans- fusion has been associated with microfilarial transmission in rare cases.13 To evaluate for  other possible exposures, I would ask the patient whether she had consumed tap water, had used ice in her drinks, or had eaten undercooked or raw foods, including meat, fish, shellfish, snails, and vegetables, while traveling.\nGeography is of paramount importance when considering possible causes of eosinophilia. Among returning travelers with eosinophilia, those who traveled to non-African countries most commonly have S. stercoralis infection or a gut-lumen helminthic infection.9 By contrast, those who traveled to African countries that are not in West Africa most commonly have schisto- somiasis, and S. stercoralis infection is the second most likely possibility. Those who traveled to\n \nWest African countries have an increased risk of filarial infections. Although the DRC is not in West Africa, it is nearby, so these infections are still possible and important to consider.\n\nFilarial Infections\nLymphatic filariasis (due to Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, or B. timori) and infections with other filariae, such as Loa loa, O. volvulus, and mansonella species, are possible diagnoses in this patient. Among travelers, infection with\nW. bancrofti or another lymphatic-dwelling filarial parasite usually occurs during a longer trip than this patient had taken.14,15 Even during long-term travel, the risk of infection is limited because pathogen transmission is inefficient,16 although transmission varies according to the vector.17 Lymphatic filariasis in travelers can be associ- ated with lymphadenitis, lymphedema, lym- phangitis, scrotal inflammation (in men), urti- caria, and respiratory symptoms.10,14 Although this patient had mild cough, she did not have the other symptoms, and her CT findings were not consistent with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. Therefore, lymphatic filariasis is unlikely.\nL. loa  can  be  found  in  the  DRC, predomi-\nnantly in the northeastern region of the coun- try.18 L. loa infection in travelers tends to occur during a longer trip than this patient had tak- en.14,15 Typical features of the infection in travel- ers include allergic symptoms, urticaria, and transient localized angioedema, also known as Calabar swellings.10,14,19 In one case series, only 16% of returning travelers and migrants with\nL.\tloa infection were asymptomatic.14 This pa-\ntient had nonspecific symptoms that were not consistent with L. loa infection, so this diagnosis is unlikely.\nThe two most likely filarial infections in this case are onchocerciasis and mansonellosis. O. vol- vulus infection is endemic in many areas of the DRC.20 The parasite is transmitted by simulium black flies, which breed along fast-flowing rivers and streams, and the infection can lead to blind- ness (which is why onchocerciasis is also re- ferred to as river blindness). Onchocerciasis is relatively rare among travelers because it usually occurs after a long period of exposure. The in- fection typically occurs with a trip duration of   6 to 12 months and often as long as 2 years.14,21 However, those traveling in areas where the dis-\nease is highly endemic can become infected af- ter a short, intense exposure.21 The median time to symptom onset is approximately 1 to 2 years in travelers, and up to 20% of patients are asymp- tomatic. Symptomatic travelers often have pruri- tus with acute papular onchodermatitis from microfilarial migration.10,21 Ocular involvement occurs almost exclusively in migrants. Overall, the timing of exposure and the absence of spe- cific symptoms could be compatible with this patient\u2019s presentation.\nAmong the three species of mansonella that cause infection in humans, Mansonella perstans is the species that is most likely to be acquired in the DRC.22,23 The parasite is transmitted by bit- ing midges. In one case series involving travelers with M. perstans infection, the minimum trip duration was 4 weeks, although the average stay was almost 5 years.14 Most patients with M. per- stans infection are asymptomatic or have nonspe- cific symptoms, including fatigue. When spe- cific symptoms occur, they are predominantly related to migration of adult worms and include transient subcutaneous swellings that are simi- lar to Calabar swellings, as well as serositis and ocular symptoms.10\nIn summary, I suspect that this patient had a filarial infection with possible concomitant re- activated EBV infection. Onchocerciasis is a pos- sibility, given that travelers can become infected after a short, intense exposure; the infection could still be in the incubation period. However, the relatively brief exposure, the presence of fa- tigue, and the absence of specific symptoms in this patient are most consistent with M. perstans infection. To establish this diagnosis, I would request examination of a blood smear prepared with concentration or filtration of the specimen and Giemsa staining. To assess for filarial infec- tions more generally, I would request filarial serologic testing.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Thomas B. Nutman: The diagnostic test in this case was the detection of M. perstans microfilariae in a Giemsa-stained thick blood smear with the specimen concentrated with the use of Knott\u2019s concentration method (Fig. 2A).\nThe definitive diagnosis of M. perstans in-\nfection is made through the detection of the parasite microscopically.24,25 Most often, this is accomplished through the identification of mi- crofilariae in a blood smear. In rare cases, adult worms can be identified in tissue specimens.\nThe sensitivity of microfilarial detection can be increased with the use of Knott\u2019s concentra- tion method or with the use of a 3-\u03bcm polycar- bonate filtration device. Each of these concen- tration techniques allows for microfilarial quantification because 1 ml of whole blood is used. In this case, the use of a 3-\u03bcm polycarbon- ate filtration device to filter 1 ml of whole blood allowed for the quantification of 52 microfilariae per milliliter (Fig. 2B through 2D).\nIn stained blood smears, microfilariae of\nM.\tperstans measure 180 to 200 \u03bcm in length, are unsheathed, and have a characteristic blunted tail with terminal nuclei.24 M. perstans microfi- lariae can be found in the blood throughout the 24-hour daily cycle. As such, M. perstans can be mistaken for L. loa when detected during the day, or for W. bancrofti when detected at night, in areas where the parasite distribution overlaps,  as it does in much of Africa.\nIn this case, a quantitative polymerase-chain- reaction (PCR) assay specific for M. perstans, which was performed to corroborate the find- ings on blood-smear examination, was positive. A quantitative PCR assay specific for L. loa, a patho- gen  that  is  often  detected  concurrently with\nM. perstans, was negative. Several quantitative PCR assays specific for M. perstans have been developed and used successfully in the context of clinical trials26,27 and field-based studies.28-30 The use of these assays for the diagnosis of in- dividual patients or for molecular identification in tissue samples remains an approach that is limited to research settings. Antifilarial IgG and IgG4 serologic assays that are based on crude filarial antigens can be positive in patients with\nM. perstans infection, but these assays cannot be\nused to distinguish between active and previous infection. Moreover, there is extensive crossreactivity among the various filarial species, so a definitive species-specific diagnosis cannot be made with serologic testing alone.\nM. perstans \u2014 formerly known as Acanthochei- lonema perstans, Dipetalonema perstans, Tetrapetalo- nema perstans, and the causative agent of perstans filariasis \u2014 is one of eight filarial parasites that infect humans.31 The pathogen is transmitted through a bite from one of several species of culicoides midges. Infective third-stage larvae (L3s) migrate from the bite site in the skin and mature over a period of several months, becoming\n \nadult worms that are typically found in the peri- toneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The adult worms can live for at least 10 years.32 After mat- ing, the female worms produce microfilariae that are found in the bloodstream. Although the prevalence of M. perstans infection is unknown, the latest estimates exceed 115 million across the regions of sub-Saharan Africa and Central and South America where the infection is endemic.\nLike the majority of patients with other bloodborne filarial infections, most patients with M. perstans infection are clinically asymp- tomatic.33 When clinical manifestations occur, the most common findings include evanescent migratory subcutaneous swellings that are simi- lar to Calabar swellings, as well as serositis with pleural and pericardial inflammation. Corneal granulomatous nodules, neuropsychiatric mani- festations such as meningoencephalitis, and hepatitis have been associated with M. perstans infection but are less common.22,34,35 Nonspecific symptoms \u2014 such as pruritus (with or without accompanying rash), urticaria, arthralgias, and myalgias, as well as marked fatigue and ab- dominal symptoms, which were present in this patient \u2014 occur frequently with M. perstans in- fection.33,36 Eosinophilia is also common; the serum IgE level may be elevated.14,33",
