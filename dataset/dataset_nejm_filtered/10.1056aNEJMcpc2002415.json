    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Eugene P. Rhee: A 74-year-old man was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of chronic kidney disease.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health when he was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospital for a preoperative evaluation of chronic kidney disease, before a transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) for aortic stenosis. Eighteen years before this evaluation, an elevated creatinine level had been found incidentally during an evaluation of fatigue, malaise, and joint stiffness. The patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of another hospital, and biopsy of\nthe right kidney was performed.\nDr. Robert B. Colvin: Pathological examination of the kidney-biopsy specimen (Fig. 1) revealed glomeruli with thickened capillary walls and mild mesangial hypercellularity. A Jones\u2019 silver stain showed \u201cspikes\u201d and \u201cbubbles\u201d in the glo- merular basement membrane, features typical of membranous nephropathy. The interstitium had an infiltrate of mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils, with tubulitis and without granulomas or neutrophils. Immunofluorescence showed staining of granular deposits for IgG and C3 along the glomerular basement mem- brane and in the mesangium. Other stains (C1q, IgA, IgM, fibrinogen, and albu- min) were negative. Electron microscopy showed widespread amorphous subepi- thelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium, with surrounding spikes and podocyte foot-process effacement. Arteriosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis were also present. At the other hospital, these findings were interpreted as membranous nephropathy, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with eosinophils, and arterionephrosclerosis with global glomerulosclerosis.\nDr. Rhee: The patient was told that his kidney disease was consistent with a diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Prednisone was administered for 6 months and then tapered to a lower dose. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate and furosemide was initiated, as was treatment with losartan, although losartan was intermittently stopped because of hyperkalemia; prednisone was continued. During the next 18 years, the creatinine level gradually increased to\n3.28 mg per deciliter (290 \u03bcmol per liter; refer- ence range, 0.70 to 1.18 mg per deciliter [62 to 104 \u03bcmol per liter]).\nTwenty-five years before the current evalua- tion, the patient had received a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis complicated by diabetes mel- litus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. One year later, painless enlargement of the right lacrimal gland occurred. Surgical excision of the right lacrimal gland was performed at the other hospital, and examination of the excised speci- men reportedly revealed nonspecific inflamma- tion. The next year, enlargement of the left lac- rimal gland and the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands developed.\nDr. Sumit Gupta: Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck, performed before and after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed masslike abnormalities of the bilateral submandibular and parotid glands. The abnor- malities were hypointense on T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging.\nDr. Rhee: The patient declined another glandu- lar biopsy and was told that he probably had Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Glandular enlargement re- solved, and during the next 23 years, the patient was treated with prednisone for presumptive Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, short- ness of breath and substernal chest pressure on exertion developed; these symptoms usually resolved after approximately 20 minutes of rest. The patient was evaluated at the other hospital, and aortic stenosis was diagnosed.\nFour months before the current evaluation, the shortness of breath and substernal chest pressure worsened, such that the patient became unable to carry his groceries a short distance to his house. Additional imaging and cardiology studies were obtained.\nDr. Gupta: Computed tomography (CT) of the heart, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed before and after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed multiple large aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with associated mural thrombus (Fig. 2A through 2D; and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). There was extensive coronary-artery calcification, along with scat- tered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in diameter, multiple mildly enlarged mediasti- nal lymph nodes, and calcification in the tail of the pancreas.\nDr. Rahul Sakhuja: Echocardiography showed severe tricuspid aortic stenosis, with bulky calci- fication of the aortic-valve leaflets with restrict- ed motion (Video 2, available at NEJM.org), as well as severe calcification of the aortic root at the sinotubular junction. Coronary angiography revealed large aneurysms with partial calcifica- tion involving all the coronary arteries \u2014 specifi- cally, the distal left main, proximal and middle left anterior descending, proximal left circum- flex, and proximal and middle right coronary arteries \u2014 and calcified narrowing between the aneurysmal segments (Fig. 2E through 2H). The distal lumens were normal in caliber and were not well visualized because of the slow f low through the proximal aneurysmal segments. There was moderate, diffuse disease in the middle left circumflex artery.\n\nDr. Rhee: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty was performed 3 months before the current evaluation, and a subsequent TAVR was planned. During the current evaluation, the patient indicated that the shortness of breath and chest pressure on exer- tion had abated since the balloon aortic valvulo- plasty. Additional history was obtained. The pa- tient had chronic back and neck pain due to severe kyphoscoliosis, spinal stenosis, and cervical myelopathy; the pain had been treated 2 months earlier with anterior cervical diskectomy and fu- sion. He had hypertension, anemia, gout, osteo- penia, and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Medi- cations included prednisone, metoprolol, aspirin, rosuvastatin, furosemide, insulin, sodium bicar- bonate, epoetin alfa, cholecalciferol, calcitriol, pancrelipase, alfuzosin, allopurinol, and gaba- pentin. There were no known drug allergies. He had smoked 10 cigarettes per day for 6 years but had stopped four decades earlier; he drank alco- hol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. The pa- tient had been retired from his career as a health care professional for 2 years. He was married and lived in a house in a suburban area of New England. His father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus and had died of prostate cancer at 67 years of age, his mother had had pancreatic can- cer and had died at 65 years of age, and his younger brother had had type 2 diabetes melli- tus and had died after a myocardial infarction at 46 years of age.\nOn physical examination, the temperature\nwas 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/75 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, and the body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.8. There was a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur that was heard best at the right upper sternal border. The creatinine level was 3.41 mg per deciliter (301 \u03bcmol per liter; reference  range,\n0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), which was similar to other levels obtained during the previous 1.5 years. The urinary pro- tein level was 149.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 13.5); the ratio of total protein to creatinine was 2.23 (reference range, <0.15). Re- sults of liver-function tests were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1. Kidney-Biopsy Specimen.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining (Panels A and B) shows glomeruli with thickened capillary walls (Panel A, arrows) and mesangial hypercellularity. There is an interstitial infiltrate of eosinophils (Panel B, arrow) and plasma cells (Panel B, oval). Immunofluorescence (Panel C) shows staining of granular deposits for IgG along the glomerular capillary wall (arrows) and in the mesangium (asterisk). Electron microscopy of a glomerulus (Panel D) shows amorphous subepithelial deposits (arrows) with adjacent spikes in the glomerular basement membrane (arrow\u2011 heads) and in the mesangium (asterisk); these findings are typical of membranous nephropathy.\n\nFigure 2 (facing page). Cardiac CT Scans and Coronary Angiography.\nCurved, multiplanar, reformatted CT images of the left anterior descending artery (Panel A), left circumflex artery (Panel B), and right coronary artery (Panel C) show aneurysms involving all the coronary arteries, with mural thrombus (white asterisks) adjacent to contrast\u2011 enhanced coronary arteries (white arrowheads). There is extensive coronary\u2011artery calcification.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Frank B. Cortazar: This 74-year-old man was re- ferred to the nephrology clinic for a preoperative evaluation in the context of advanced chronic kidney disease. Several features of this patient\u2019s presentation \u2014 including the history of mem- branous nephropathy, tubulointerstitial nephritis, chronic pancreatitis without a history of alcohol use, enlargement of the lacrimal and salivary glands, and coronary-artery aneurysms \u2014 are suggestive of a systemic disease that has yet to be diagnosed. One approach to clinical problem- solving is to begin by focusing on unique fea- tures of the case that have a limited differential diagnosis. In this case, the differential diagnosis will be constructed around the unusual simulta- neous occurrence of membranous nephropathy and tubulointerstitial nephritis. The diagnostic possibilities will then be refined by assessing the capacity of each of the disease processes to explain all the features of the patient\u2019s presenta- tion, including the development of pancreatitis and enlargement of the lacrimal, submandibu- lar, and parotid glands.\nMembranous Nephropathy\nMembranous nephropathy is caused by the grad- ual accumulation of immune deposits in the subepithelial aspect of the glomerular basement membrane, which leads to podocyte damage and proteinuria. Primary membranous nephrop- athy \u2014 an isolated kidney disease that results from autoantibodies directed against endoge- nous podocyte-specific antigens in the absence of an identifiable cause \u2014 accounts for most cases. Alternatively, membranous nephropathy can be secondary to a predisposing condition, such as autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), infection (e.g., hepatitis B or syphilis), medication use (e.g., use of nonsteroi- dal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), cancer, or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.1 The M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) is the target antigen in approximately 70% of patients with primary membranous nephropathy.2 A diagnosis of PLA2R-associated membranous nephropathy can be established by the identification of circu- lating anti-PLA2R antibodies or positive staining for PLA2R on a kidney-biopsy specimen. How- ever, anti-PLA2R antibody testing was not avail- able 18 years ago, when this patient received the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy.\nOther pathological features can assist in dif- ferentiating primary from secondary membra- nous nephropathy. In secondary membranous\n \nnephropathy, the target antigen is extrinsic to the podocyte and reaches the glomerular base- ment membrane through the circulation.3 This often results in the generation of subendothelial and mesangial deposits in addition to the sub- epithelial deposits that are characteristic of mem- branous nephropathy. Furthermore, the domi- nant immunoglobulin in primary membranous nephropathy is of the IgG4 subclass, whereas the other IgG subclasses predominate in most causes of secondary membranous nephropathy.4 The presence of mesangial deposits in this case suggests the possibility of secondary membra- nous nephropathy. Moreover, the presence of con- comitant tubulointerstitial nephritis is strongly suggestive of a disease process other than pri- mary membranous nephropathy.\n\nInterstitial Nephritis\nIn addition to showing evidence of membranous nephropathy, this patient\u2019s kidney-biopsy speci- men was noted to have an interstitial infiltrate containing eosinophils, a finding consistent with tubulointerstitial nephritis. Most cases of tubulo- interstitial nephritis are caused by the use of a medication such as antibiotic drugs, NSAIDs, proton-pump inhibitors, or as described more recently, immune-checkpoint inhibitors.5,6 Other causes of tubulointerstitial nephritis include sys- temic autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syn- drome), infection (e.g., legionella or Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection), and tubulointerstitial ne- phritis and uveitis syndrome.5 Few pathological features assist in identifying the cause of inter- stitial nephritis. The identification of granulo- mas, which were not present in this case, would arouse suspicion for sarcoidosis, but granulomas can also be seen with infection and drug-induced tubulointerstitial nephritis. The presence of eosin- ophils is compatible with drug-induced tubulo- interstitial nephritis, but this finding is not specific for this entity. In rare cases, NSAIDs can cause the combination of interstitial nephri- tis and nephrotic syndrome, although in this con- text, the glomerular lesion is classically caused by minimal change disease.7 It is possible that the use of NSAIDs led to tubulointerstitial ne- phritis and membranous nephropathy in this patient, and he should be asked about any clini- cally significant previous NSAID use. The other phropathy (class V), without an associated pro- liferative lesion.8 Tubulointerstitial nephritis of- ten accompanies glomerular lesions in patients with lupus nephritis and is a risk factor for poor renal outcome.9 In contrast to patients with fo- cal or diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, pa- tients with pure lupus membranous nephropathy often present with normal levels of C3 and C4 and have negative testing for anti\u2013double- stranded DNA antibodies.10 However, there are other pathological features, in addition to the characteristic findings of secondary membra- nous nephropathy, that suggest a diagnosis of lupus membranous nephropathy. These include a \u201cfull house\u201d pattern (i.e., the presence of glo- merular deposits that stain for IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C1q) on immunofluorescence, as well as the presence of tubuloreticular structures in endothelial cells on electron microscopy.11 The apparent absence of these features on examina- tion of the kidney-biopsy specimen, coupled with the patient\u2019s sex and the absence of character- istic extrarenal features, make a diagnosis of lupus unlikely.\nSj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome\nThis patient had received a diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, which was thought to be the cause of his kidney disease. Interstitial nephritis is the most common renal manifestation of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome and is often associated with distal renal tubular acidosis.12 Glomerular disease in Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome is rare. When it occurs, the most common pattern of injury is membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, which is typi- cally caused by production of a monoclonal IgM kappa paraprotein with rheumatoid factor activity that leads to type II mixed cryoglobulinemia.13 Membranous nephropathy has been described in the context of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome in rare cases.14 It is unclear whether these cases reflect the si- multaneous occurrence of two distinct disease processes or show causality. Of note, most case reports of membranous nephropathy attributed to Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome were published before the availability of anti-PLA2R antibody testing.12,15\nThe combination of tubulointerstitial nephri-\ntis and membranous nephropathy would be an unusual manifestation of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Moreover, pancreatitis and coronary-artery an- eurysms cannot be readily attributed to this diag- nosis. These considerations should prompt re- evaluation of the diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome in this patient.\nResults of testing for antibodies to the Ro (SSA) and La (SSB) antigens are not provided in the case presentation, and sicca symptoms are not reported. The patient\u2019s diagnosis of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome had been based on swelling of the lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands \u2014 a constellation of findings consistent with Miku- licz\u2019s disease. Within the past two decades, it has become apparent that most cases of Mikulicz\u2019s disease are caused by IgG4-related disease16 and not Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.\n\nIgG4-Related Disease\nIgG4-related disease is a systemic fibroinflam- matory condition that was first recognized as a unifying disease process in the early 2000s. Many conditions that were previously thought to be isolated entities \u2014 including type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis, Mikulicz\u2019s disease, chronic scleros- ing sialadenitis (called K\u00fcttner\u2019s tumor when submandibular glands are involved), fibrous thyroiditis (Riedel\u2019s thyroiditis), and many cases of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond\u2019s disease) \u2014 are now known to be manifestations of IgG4-related disease.17 Regardless of the in- volved organ, the disease is characterized by two dominant histopathological features: a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with IgG4+ plasma cells and storiform fibrosis.18 Tissue eosinophilia and obliterative phlebitis are also common findings in some organs. The serum IgG4 level is elevated in most patients with IgG4-related disease.\nThe kidney is unique among organs affected by IgG4-related disease in that it is associated with two distinct histologic patterns of injury.20 The most common renal manifestation of IgG4- related disease is tubulointerstitial nephritis, which is often accompanied by hypocomple- mentemia and hypodense nodular lesions on contrast-enhanced CT. In addition to the hall- mark pathological features of the disease, tissue eosinophilia and deposits in the tubular base- ment membrane are often noted.21 The second pattern of injury is IgG4-related membranous nephropathy, which can occur alone or in com- bination with IgG4-related tubulointerstitial ne- phritis.22 As with primary membranous nephrop- athy, the dominant immunoglobulin found in immune deposits is IgG4. Testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies, however, is characteristically nega- tive in patients with IgG4-related membranous nephropathy. The results of this patient\u2019s kidney biopsy could be compatible with IgG4-related kidney disease.\nIgG4-related disease also unifies the other unexplained features in this case. The patient\u2019s chronic pancreatitis is probably the result of type 1 (IgG4-related) autoimmune pancreatitis, which often occurs in older men and can lead to endocrine and exocrine pancreatic failure.23 IgG4- related disease can also cause vasculitis and aneurysm formation. Large-vessel vasculitis in- volving the thoracic and abdominal aorta is most common, but coronary arteritis with resultant aneurysm formation has also been described.24,25 Finally, although the incidental pulmonary nod- ules and hilar lymphadenopathy noted on CT are nonspecific, they may also be manifestations of IgG4-related disease.26\nAn elevated serum IgG4 level in this patient\nwould be highly supportive but not diagnostic of IgG4-related disease. Integration of clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data is needed to reliably establish the diagnosis. A kidney bi- opsy, or reexamination of the previously obtained specimens of the kidney and lacrimal gland, if available, would confirm the diagnosis.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Colvin: The serum IgG level was 2741 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295). The IgG4 level was 925.4 mg per deciliter (reference range,\n3.9\tto 86.4), a finding highly supportive of the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.\nOn request, the kidney-biopsy specimen that had been obtained 18 years earlier was stained for IgG and IgG4 (Fig. 3). The IgG+ plasma cells were predominantly IgG4+, with more than 30 IgG4+ cells per high-power field. Deposits in the glomerular basement membrane were posi- tive for IgG4, as were deposits along the tubular basement membrane. These findings are typical of IgG4-related disease affecting the kidney.20 Approximately 8% of patients with IgG4-related disease who undergo kidney biopsy have membranous nephropathy (40% of whom have  mesangial deposits), and 70 to 80% have deposits along the tubular basement membrane.21,22\nThe lacrimal-gland specimen that had been ob- tained 24 years earlier was also reviewed. The ex- cised lacrimal gland measured 3.2 cm by 2.5 cm by 1.2 cm. Pathological examination of the speci- men (Fig. 4) revealed a diffuse infiltrate of mono- nuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils embedded in extensive fibrosis with a storiform pattern. Germinal centers were present, as were scattered remnants of lacrimal gland. Immuno- histochemical staining showed polytypic immu- noglobulin in plasma cells, B cells (CD20+), and T cells (CD3+CD5+). There was no evidence of cancer. Prominent IgG4+ plasma cells were present and accounted for more than 90% of the IgG+ plasma cells. Transmural arteritis and ob- literative phlebitis were not present. In summa- ry, reexamination of the specimens was diagnos- tic of IgG4-related disease affecting the kidney and lacrimal gland.\nFigure 3.

A similar field shows that most of the plasma cells in the same area are IgG4+ (Panel B, oval). The granular deposits in the glomerular basement membrane are also IgG4+ (Panel C, arrows). Similar granular deposits are focally present in the tubular basement membrane (Panel D, arrows).\n\nFigure 4.

Prominent infiltrates of eosinophils (Panel C, arrows) and plasma cells (Panel C, oval) are present. Scat\u2011 tered remnants of lacrimal gland (Panel D, arrows) can be seen in the inflammatory mass.
