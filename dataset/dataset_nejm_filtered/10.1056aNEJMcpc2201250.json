    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran (Medicine): A 21-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of fatigue, weight gain, and abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been well until 4 months before the current evaluation, when an episode of dull, aching pain in the right lower quadrant occurred. The pain lasted for a few hours before resolving spontaneously. During the next 4 months, episodes of abdominal pain continued to occur and increased in duration, fre- quency, and severity. The patient sought evaluation in the gynecology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described the pain as variable, rating it between 3 and 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. The episodes of pain occurred daily and lasted for up to 20 hours. The pain decreased with sitting or lying down and did not increase with movement; it was not associated with her menstrual period. The patient also reported fatigue, irritability, and weight gain of 4.5 kg in the previous 4 months despite increased exercise and decreased food intake.\nThere was a history of hypothyroidism, anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, and migraines. The patient had never been pregnant and had no known history of sexually transmitted infections or abnormal results on screening tests for cervical cancer. She had previously been sexually active with male partners, but she re- ported no current sexual activity. She had taken oral contraceptives for 2 years but had stopped taking them 6 months before this evaluation, when a levonorgestrel- releasing intrauterine device (IUD) was placed. Other medications included levo- thyroxine, citalopram, and multivitamins; there were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with roommates in an urban area of New England. She was a former athlete and worked as a research scientist. She did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her family history included hypothyroidism in her mother, coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia in her father, breast cancer and diabetes in her paternal grandmother, and lung cancer in her paternal grand- father.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 119/73 mm Hg and the heart rate 62 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.4. The thyroid was firm on pal- pation, with a small nodule noted on the right side. The abdomen was nondistended, soft, and nontender. A small hernia with a thrill was  noted at the right inguinal ring. A speculum examination of the vagina and cervix was nor- mal; IUD strings were visible at the cervical os. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes and glucose and re- sults of tests for kidney, liver, and thyroid func- tion. Screening tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and syphilis were negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine Sertic: Transabdominal and trans-\nvaginal ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a mass (measuring 4.8 cm by 5.0 cm by 3.9 cm) along the posterior aspect of the right hepatic lobe (Fig. 1A). The uterus, ovaries, and adnexa were normal. There was no free f luid in the pelvis, and the IUD was in an appropriate position.\nMagnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right adrenal mass (measuring 4.5 cm by 4.7 cm by\n4.0 cm) that was T2 isointense (Fig. 1B) and T1 hypointense. The mass had diffusion restriction (Fig. 1C), as well as early enhancement with washout, which refers to the temporal reduction in the enhancement of a lesion. The features were indeterminate and were not definitively diagnostic of adrenal adenoma or another adre- nal lesion, such as pheochromocytoma or adre- nocortical carcinoma.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis again revealed a right adrenal mass, which had a density of 33 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material (Fig. 1D), 74 HU during the portal-venous phase (Fig. 1E), and 45 HU during the 15-minute de- layed phase (Fig. 1F). The absolute washout was calculated as 71%. The absolute washout is cal- culated by dividing the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the delayed- phase density by the difference between the portal-venous\u2013phase density and the unenhanced density and then converting the result to a per- centage: [(HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU delayed phase) / (HU portal-venous phase \u2212 HU unen- hanced)] \u00d7 100. Adrenal adenomas tend to wash out faster than other adrenal lesions, and an ab- solute washout of more than 60% is highly sug- gestive of an adrenal adenoma. However, lesions larger than 4 cm are likely to be malignant, re- gardless of the washout characteristics.1 There was also a thin-walled cyst (measuring 3.3 cm in diameter) in the lower lobe of the left lung.\nDr. Tran: The patient was referred to the endo-\ncrinology clinic of this hospital. Additional labo- ratory tests were performed to further evaluate the adrenal mass. Blood levels of renin and aldo- sterone were normal, as were urinary levels of catecholamines and metanephrines. An overnight, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed. The baseline blood corticotropin level was 3 pg per milliliter (0.7 pmol per liter; reference range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1.3 to\n16.7 pmol per liter]). At 11 p.m., dexamethasone (1 mg) was administered; at 8 a.m., the blood cortisol level was 9.1 \u03bcg per deciliter (251 nmol per liter; reference value, <1.8 \u03bcg per deciliter [50 nmol per liter]), and the concurrent blood dexamethasone level was 631 ng per deciliter (reference range, 140 to 295). The 24-hour uri- nary free cortisol level was 31.0 \u03bcg (reference range, 3.5 to 45.0); the blood levels of dehydro- epiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were normal.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Allison Kimball: I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the final diagnosis. When I initially evaluated this patient in the endocrinology clinic, there were two key ques- tions to address. First, was the adrenal mass benign or cancerous? Second, was the lesion hormone-secreting?\n\nAdrenal Mass\nThe differential diagnosis for the adrenal mass in this patient included adrenal adenoma (which is benign), pheochromocytoma,  adrenocortical carcinoma, and adrenal metastasis. Imaging characteristics can be helpful in distinguishing among these possible causes, as well as in ruling out other entities. An adrenal cyst, adrenal hem- orrhage, and myelolipoma (a benign tumor that consists of mature adipose tissue and hemato- poietic components) could be ruled out on the basis of the imaging findings. Adrenal adeno- mas are typically round, homogeneous, and rela- tively small; the size of this patient\u2019s adrenal mass was atypical for an adrenal adenoma, but the homogeneous appearance was consistent with this diagnosis. Pheochromocytomas are typically highly vascular and may show cystic or hemor- rhagic changes; neither of these features was seen in this patient. Adrenocortical carcinomas are typically unilateral and may be irregular in shape. Adrenal metastases are typically bilateral, which made this diagnosis unlikely in this patient. The density of the mass before the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material can be helpful in distinguishing among the various possible causes. Most adrenal adenomas have a high lipid content and thus have a low density on unenhanced CT (<10 HU). The density of this patient\u2019s adrenal mass on unenhanced CT was indeterminate (33 HU) and thus difficult to in-\nterpret.\nThe absolute washout after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material can also be helpful. A value of less than 50% at 15 minutes is characteristic of pheochromocytoma, adreno- cortical carcinoma, and adrenal metastasis. A value of more than 60% at 15 minutes, which was seen in this patient, is most consistent with the diagnosis of adrenal adenoma.\nAdrenal Adenoma\nGiven the imaging findings observed in this patient, the diagnosis of adrenal adenoma was suspected. The next step in her evaluation was to determine whether the suspected adenoma was hormone-secreting, which would result in excess hormone levels. Primary aldosteronism (autono- mous aldosterone secretion) leads to hyperten- sion and, in some cases, hypokalemia; this pa- tient\u2019s blood pressure and potassium level were normal. In addition, her aldosterone level was not elevated, and her renin level was not sup- pressed; these findings ruled out primary aldo- steronism. Pheochromocytoma could be ruled out by the normal urinary levels of metanephrines and catecholamines.\nSubclinical Cushing\u2019s syndrome (autonomous cortisol secretion without clinical manifestations of excess cortisol) is the most common hor- monal abnormality diagnosed in patients with an incidentally noted adrenal adenoma. The pa- tient\u2019s low baseline corticotropin level, in con- junction with a nonsuppressed cortisol level after the overnight administration of low-dose dexa- methasone, was consistent with corticotropin- independent autonomous cortisol production. She did not have the physical findings associated with Cushing\u2019s syndrome, although she reported weight gain despite increased exercise, which could be related to autonomous cortisol production. The 24-hour urinary free cortisol level, which was normal in this patient, is not typically elevated in patients with subclinical Cushing\u2019s syndrome. Overall, this patient\u2019s presentation was most consistent with a cortisol-secreting adrenal ade- noma that was causing subclinical Cushing\u2019s syndrome. However, the size of the adrenal mass was worrisome. The risk of adrenocortical carcinoma was otherwise low, given her young age and the rarity of the condition. However, the risk of adrenocortical carcinoma is increased when the adrenal mass is greater than 4 cm in diameter.1 Because of the need to rule out adre- nocortical carcinoma, laparoscopic right adre-\nnalectomy was performed.\n",
