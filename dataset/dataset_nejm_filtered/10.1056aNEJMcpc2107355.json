    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Viral S. Shah: A 26-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure and altered mental status.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before the current admission, when she underwent elective abdominoplasty and liposuction at an ambulatory surgery center. During the procedure, anesthetic agents included in- travenous propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, and ketamine, as well as local lidocaine injections. During recovery after the procedure, medications included intravenous cefazolin, enoxaparin, and ondansetron; oral oxycodone, tramadol, and gabapen- tin; and transdermal scopolamine. The patient was lethargic after the procedure but was able to be discharged home after a period of observation.\nLater that day, the patient was instructed by telephone to take a lower dose of postoperative oxycodone. The next day, on evaluation at the surgical center, she was found to be somnolent but arousable and able to answer questions with effort; the scopolamine patch was removed. Several hours after the patient returned home, her family noticed that she had increased respiratory effort and minimal responsiveness. She was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of a local hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 121/77 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 83% while the patient was breathing ambi- ent air. She was lethargic, moaned intermittently, and responded with one-word answers; symmetric movement in the arms and legs was observed. Intravenous naloxone was administered, with minor improvement in her condition. Levels of electrolytes and results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, rightward axis deviation, and nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave changes.\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A chest radiograph showed diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary-embolism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism but revealed diffuse mixed ground-glass and consolidative opacities involving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the subpleural lung (Fig. 1B). CT of the abdomen revealed postoperative changes. CT of the head, performed without the admin- istration of contrast material, revealed mild effacement of the cerebral sulci and cisterns on both sides, a finding suggestive of mild diffuse cerebral edema (Fig. 1C and 1D). There was also a small hypodensity in the left globus pal- lidus, a finding suggestive of infarction.\nDr. Shah: Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated, and the patient was ad- mitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at the other hospital. Intravenous vancomycin, piperacil- lin\u2013tazobactam, levofloxacin, and oseltamivir were administered empirically, and a triple-lumen central venous catheter was inserted.\nThe next morning, the findings on a repeat chest radiograph appeared to be unchanged, but the patient had progressive lethargy, so intuba- tion was performed and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Pink frothy secretions were noted. Intravenous methylprednisolone, propofol, and norepinephrine were administered. A nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative. The tropo- nin I level increased to 4.31 ng per milliliter (reference range, <0.029). The thyrotropin, car- boxyhemoglobin, and lipase levels were normal, and tests for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococ- cus pneumoniae urinary antigens were negative.\nLater that afternoon, the patient was trans- ferred to the ICU at this hospital. A review of systems was unavailable because intubation was performed on arrival. Medical history that was obtained from family members included iron- deficiency anemia, anxiety disorder, insomnia, and two normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries.\nRegular medications included lorazepam as needed for sleep; postoperative medications in- cluded tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone as needed for pain. There were no known adverse reactions to medication. The patient had attended college and worked in an office. She lived with her husband and children. She drank alcohol intermittently and did not use tobacco or other substances. There was no family history of car- diopulmonary or neurologic disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 118/78  mm  Hg  while  the  patient  was  receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 8 \u03bcg per minute. The height was 168 cm and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.8. The oxygen satura- tion was 99% while the patient was receiving oxy- gen through a mechanical ventilator in volume- control mode (tidal volume, 320 ml; positive end-expiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; respira- tory rate, 18 breaths per minute; fraction of in- spired oxygen, 1.0). The pupils were 2 mm and symmetrically reactive. The lung sounds were coarse. The abdominal incision was well approxi- mated and without drainage; abdominal drains were in place on both sides. A neurologic exami- nation with interruption of sedation showed spontaneous eye-opening but an inability to vi- sually track and to follow commands. Brain-stem reflexes were intact. The legs withdrew equally and briskly in response to pain. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nA chest radiograph showed diffuse opacities\nin both lungs. Levels of electrolytes, urea nitro- gen, creatinine, calcium, alanine aminotransfer- ase, bilirubin, creatine kinase, lipase, and am- monia were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Urine toxico- logic screening was negative except for the pres- ence of opiates. Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for microbiologic culture. An elec- trocardiogram including posterior leads showed sinus rhythm, rightward axis deviation, diminu- tive Q waves, and minor nonspecific ST\u2013T-wave abnormalities. An abdominal radiograph showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern, subcutaneous emphysema, and surgical drains over the pelvis. On bedside cardiac ultrasonography, the left ventricle could not be visualized clearly, but right ventricular dilatation did not appear to be present. Intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and metroni- dazole were administered.\nDr. Mendoza: CT of the head, performed with- out the administration of contrast material, revealed hypodensities in the left basal ganglia and right cerebellum that were suggestive of infarcts; the previously described cerebral edema had reduced slightly. A CT angiogram of the head and neck was normal. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed a reduction in ground-glass opacities but an increase in con- solidations, particularly in the lower lobes. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small anterior abdominal hematoma and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.\nDr. Shah: A neurology consultation was obtained; aspirin and atorvastatin were adminis- tered. On hospital day 2, the findings on neuro- logic examination worsened, with only sluggish eye-opening and no motor responses to noxious stimuli. Intravenous mannitol at a dose of 1 g per kilogram of body weight was administered.\nDr. Mendoza: Repeat CT of the head, per- formed without the administration of contrast material, revealed a hypodensity in the left glo- bus pallidus that had not changed from the previ- ous study, as well as a hypodensity in the right cerebellum that was not definitive and was prob- ably an artifact. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed infarcts within the globi pallidi and smaller punctate infarcts in the cerebral white matter. There were also innumer- able diffuse microhemorrhagic foci affecting the cerebral white matter, including the corpus cal- losum (Fig. 2).\nDr. Shah: Bronchoscopy revealed bloody mucus in the distal trachea (Fig. 3). Serial bronchoal- veolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right upper lobe revealed increasingly erythematous effluent. Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin anti- bodies were not detected. Levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. Tests for legionella, streptococcus, and galactomannan urinary antigens and antitrepo- nemal antibodies were negative, as was a repeat nucleic acid test for SARS-CoV-2.\nDr. Yasmin Aghajan: On hospital day 3, the patient underwent continuous electroencephalo- graphic monitoring. The study was abnormal because of generalized rhythmic delta activity at a frequency of 1 Hz, which occasionally evolved to generalized periodic discharges superimposed on a disorganized background with irregular delta and theta slowing. There were no epilepti- form abnormalities. Although generalized rhyth- mic delta activity and generalized periodic dis- charges are on the ictal\u2013interictal continuum, there were no features suggestive of seizures. The electroencephalographic findings were con- sistent with encephalopathy and the effects of propofol.\n\nTable 1.

Initial Imaging Studies.\nA frontal chest radiograph (Panel A) shows diffuse confluent opacities in both lungs, with relative sparing of the lung apexes. A coronal CT image of the chest (Panel B) shows diffuse mixed ground\u2011glass and consolidative opacities in\u2011 volving all lobes of the lungs, with relative sparing of the lung apexes and of the peripheral subpleural lung (arrows). An axial CT image of the head (Panel C) shows mild diffuse cerebral edema and effacement of the sulci and basilar cisterns (arrows). A coronal reformatted CT image of the head (Panel D) shows effacement of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces extending to the vertex (arrows), with preserved gray\u2013white matter differentiation.\n\nFigure 2. MRI of the Head.\nMRI of the head was performed on hospital day 2. An isotropic diffusion\u2011weighted image (Panel A) shows foci of increased signal in the globi pallidi (arrows). A corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient map image (Panel B) shows low values (arrows), a finding that confirms the presence of abnormal restricted diffusion in the globi pallidi. Susceptibility\u2011weighted images (Panels C and D) show diffuse foci of microhemorrhage (signal loss) throughout the cerebral white matter (Panel C, arrows) and the corpus callosum (Panel D, arrows).\n\nFigure 3. Images Obtained on Bronchoscopy.\nFlexible bronchoscopy was performed on hospital day 2. Panel A shows bloody secretions in the airways and along the airway walls, which were easily removed with suc\u2011 tioning at the level of the main carina. Panel B shows the bronchus intermedius with openings to the right middle lobe (yellow asterisk) and the right lower lobe (white asterisk) that have thin bloody secretions, which are representative of the findings throughout the airways. There are no mucosal abnormalities, le\u2011 sions, or obstructions to the level of the subsegmental airways. Serial bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe with the sequential administration of 30 ml of normal saline. Panel C shows the return of increasingly erythematous effluent, a finding consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Aran Kadar: This 26-year-old, otherwise healthy woman presented shortly after elective abdomi- noplasty and liposuction with respiratory failure, diffuse pulmonary opacities, and cerebral edema. Given the context, two diagnoses come im- mediately to mind. The first possibility is post- procedural aspiration of gastric contents. Gross aspiration would not necessarily be the cause, because even a small amount of acidic material can lead to widespread lung injury. The second possibility is fat embolism. This rare condition is most often associated with long-bone fracture, but it has been described with other mechanisms of trauma to adipose tissue, including liposuction.1 Delayed postoperative hypoxemic respiratory failure is often suggestive of pulmonary embo- lism, but this condition would not be expected to produce such diffuse opacities. This patient\u2019s find- ings on imaging prompt a review of the differen- tial diagnosis for acute alveolar filling processes.\nAcute Alveolar Filling Processes\nConditions that cause acute alveolar filling pro- cesses can be considered in terms of the sub- stances that rapidly accumulate in the alveoli in the appropriate clinical scenario. The most com- mon substances are water, pus, and blood. Cellu- lar materials such as cancer cells, eosinophils associated with eosinophilic pneumonia, and fibroblasts associated with organizing pneumo- nia, as well as the surfactant associated with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, tend to accumu- late at a more prolonged or subacute tempo.2\n\nPulmonary Edema\nAmong the most common causes of acute alveo- lar filling processes are conditions that lead to pulmonary edema, which can be either cardio- genic or noncardiogenic. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically involves acute myocardial dys- function, which can occur with acute coronary syndrome. Sudden valvular failure and hyperten- sive emergency can also precipitate acute pul- monary edema. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may be considered to be synonymous with acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is most often provoked by infection but can also be seen with exposure to caustic materials, drugs, trauma, or inflammation outside the chest. The wide- spread distribution of pulmonary opacities in this case favors a noncardiogenic process.\n\nInfection\nLower respiratory tract infection can lead to an acute purulent alveolar filling process and can be due to a broad array of pathogens. However, bron- choscopic evaluation of the airways did not reveal purulence, so an infectious process is unlikely.\n\nHemorrhage\nBlood that rapidly accumulates in the alveoli typically originates from either airway lesions or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Serial BAL can be performed to distinguish between these two ori- gins and may help to further refine the differen- tial diagnosis. In this case, the increase in blood on serial BAL suggests alveolar hemorrhage.\nDiffuse alveolar hemorrhage is often associat- ed with vasculitis, especially antineutrophil cyto- plasmic antibody\u2013associated disease, although any diffuse alveolar injury can lead to hemorrhage. Effects of drugs, especially anticoagulants, are another frequent cause of alveolar hemorrhage. On the basis of our knowledge of this patient\u2019s history, we have no reason to suspect vasculitis, and she was not taking anticoagulants.\nTo further refine the differential diagnosis, we need to address other relevant aspects of the patient\u2019s presentation. Several data points distract from the most likely diagnosis or reflect only the severity of illness without pointing toward the cause. Among these less useful data points is the elevated lactate level, which probably reflects increased sympathetic tone rather than an organ threatened with ischemia. In addition, she had an elevated troponin level, which is a cardiac marker that is elevated in more than 40% of critically ill patients. However, the history, the findings on the electrocardiogram obtained at presentation, and the absence of a wall-motion abnormality on bedside cardiac ultrasonography (albeit with limited visualization) all argue against an acute coronary syndrome.\nThe patient had an elevated procalcitonin level, a finding that would ideally help to distinguish between bacterial infection and other causes. Fat embolism causes an increase in the level of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, which would be expected to increase the procalcitonin level and has been described in case reports of fat embo- lism.3 This information does not help us to dis- tinguish between the presence of superimposed bacterial infection and aspiration. The elevated B-type natriuretic peptide level may reflect car- diac strain from the severe hypoxemia, but it does not point us toward left ventricular dys- function as a proximate cause.\nA critical additional feature of this patient\u2019s\npresentation is cerebral edema and the later de- velopment of a pattern of brain injury with a more embolic appearance. Delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy could produce changes in mental status, but without hypotension or a dis- ruption of cerebral blood flow, it would not typically generate the degree of structural dam- age observed in this patient.4 Carbon monoxide poisoning could produce cerebral edema and focal changes in the globus pallidus,5 but the history does not suggest such an exposure.\nBecause fat droplets are compliant enough to pass through the pulmonary capillary bed and embolize to the central nervous system even in the absence of a patent foramen ovale, the diag- nosis of fat embolism syndrome occurring after the liposuction procedure best explains this pa- tient\u2019s combination of lung injury, diffuse alveo- lar hemorrhage, and cerebral injury.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Kartik Viswanathan: The cytopathology labora- tory received 35 ml of a blood-tinged BAL speci- men. A portion of the BAL specimen was tested with a SurePath liquid-based preparation (Becton Dickinson), and the other portion was applied to a cytospin slide for oil red O (ORO) staining. ORO staining is used to assess for the presence of lipids, which appear red when visualized under light microscopy.6\nOn review of the SurePath slide, there were few benign bronchial cells, abundant acute inflamma- tory cells, and scattered macrophages with well defined cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 4A). On light microscopic examination with ORO staining, the well-defined vacuoles showed red staining, which highlighted the lipid content (Fig. 4B). The ORO staining was scored in 100 macrophages in hot spots, and the scores were summated to gener- ate the lipid-laden macrophage index (LLMI),7,8 which was 110. At our institution, ORO staining of BAL specimens is most often used to assess for chronic aspiration in pediatric patients with airway obstruction and in patients who have un- dergone lung transplantation as a part of their postoperative surveillance. As a point of reference, an LLMI of more than 90 is considered to indicate high risk for aspiration in these patients.7,8\nData regarding the use of ORO staining of BAL specimens as an indicator of fat embolism are limited. A few studies have reported increased lipid-laden macrophages with ORO staining in BAL specimens from patients with trauma and patients with sickle cell disease who had fat embolism9-11; however, the correlation has not been consistent in other studies.12,13 Moreover, various conditions have been associated with increased ORO-positive lipid-laden macrophages, including infectious pneumonia, aspiration, gas- troesophageal reflux disease, the use of gluco- corticoid treatment, and human immunodefi- ciency virus infection.14 Thus, the presence of increased ORO-positive lipid-laden macrophages is not specific for fat embolism.\nOther notable potential challenges in interpreting the results of ORO staining of BAL specimens include variation in scoring between observers, variation in scoring systems (LLMI vs. percentage of ORO-positive alveolar macrophages), staining quality, air-bubble formation, and the presence of hemosiderin and anthracotic pigment in alveo- lar macrophages.8 Overall, the LLMI was increased in this patient\u2019s BAL specimen; however, given the relatively low specificity of this test, the LLMI would need to be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and radiologic findings.\n",
