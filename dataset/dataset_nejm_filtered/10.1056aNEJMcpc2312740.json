    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Zandra E. Walton (Medicine): A 67-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of headache and retro-orbital pain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 months before the current admission, when a photosensitive, erythematous, papular rash developed on the forearms a few weeks after she had started treatment with hydrochloro- thiazide. Over the next 7 months, an intermittent, painless, nonpruritic, erythem- atous, annular rash developed on the trunk and the proximal portions of the arms and legs.\nThree months before the current presentation, the rashes worsened, and the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist at another hospital. The thyrotropin level was normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a punch-biopsy specimen of abdominal skin reportedly showed spongiotic der- matitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory-cell infiltrate with eosinophils; neither vasculitis nor dermal mucin was found. The rashes were thought to be related to medication; treatment with amlodipine was started, and hydrochlorothiazide was discontinued. She was treated with topical triamcinolone ointment. The photosensitive rash on the forearms resolved, and the annular rash on the trunk abated.\nTen days after the evaluation at the first hospital, and 8 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of a second hospital because of progressive temporal headache with retro-orbital pain on the left side that had lasted for 3 days. The physical examination was reportedly normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 19). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. Computed tomography (CT) of the head was performed and reportedly showed mild periventricular white-matter disease with no acute intra- cranial abnormality. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial aneurysm, stenosis, or occlusion. The patient was discharged home.\nThe next morning, the patient awoke with double vision. The headache had resolved. She presented to a neuro-ophthalmology urgent care clinic associated with this hospital. The patient reported persistent pain in the left eye, which was worse with abduction, as well as photosensitivity and an episode of pain in the left side of the jaw in the preceding week. She had normal visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, and afferent visual function. The optic disks were normal, sharp, and f lat. The left eye had esotropia and hypertropia, as well as a limitation in abduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 11 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). A presumptive diagnosis of acute left sixth cranial nerve palsy associated with cerebral microvascular disease was considered. Corrective treatment with eye patch- ing was recommended, and the double vision resolved over the next 3 weeks.\nEight weeks after she had presented to the emergency department of the second hospital, the patient presented to the emergency depart- ment of a third hospital because similar symp- toms had developed in her right eye. She re- ported having headache with retro-orbital pain on the right side over the past 3 days, accompanied by changes in her color vision and occasional float- ers. The physical examination was notable for a blood pressure of 159/66 mm Hg and an abduction deficit of the right eye. The erythrocyte sedimen- tation rate was 17 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 30), and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level was 1.64 mg per liter (reference value, <3.00). The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney function. A screening test for Lyme disease anti- bodies was negative.\nDr. Jeremy N. Ford: Cross-sectional imaging of the head and orbits had been performed at the first hospital, and the results were reinterpreted at the third hospital. CT of the head (Fig. 1A and 1B) reportedly showed stranding of the intra- conal fat in the right orbit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiog- raphy of the head, neck, and orbits (performed with and without the administration of intrave- nous contrast material) reportedly showed abnor- mal enhancement and edema of the optic nerve and surrounding tissue on the right side. On my directed review of the MRI (Fig. 1C through 1F), I found that the mild edema and enhancement predominantly involved the optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat, which confirmed the findings on CT of the head. The optic nerve itself was largely spared. The temporomandibular joints were partially visible, and there was mild periar- ticular edema and enhancement of the left joint. On T2-weighted imaging, scattered hyperintense foci were seen in the periventricular and subcorti- cal white matter, a nonspecific finding most likely attributable to chronic small-vessel disease. Dr. Walton: Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was transferred to the neurology unit of this hospital. On evalua- tion, she reported persistent double vision and pain on right lateral gaze but resolution of the retro-orbital headache. She also reported a re- cent mild f lare of an erythematous, annular rash, as well as recent hair thinning and long- standing Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Review of systems was negative for fever, night sweats, weight loss, joint erythema or swelling, muscle stiffness or pain, scalp or temple tenderness, jaw claudication, recurrent sinusitis, nasal crusting, epistaxis, cough, hoarseness, cough or shortness of breath, hemoptysis, dry mouth or dry eyes, oral ulcers, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, hear- ing changes, paresthesia, weakness in the arms and legs, or changes in the nails. There were no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms.\nThe patient had a remote history of Graves\u2019\ndisease with orbitopathy that had been diag- nosed and treated more than two decades before this presentation. The medical history was also notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hyper- lipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, chole- cystectomy, ovary-sparing hysterectomy, and lumpectomy for estrogen receptor\u2013positive, pro- gesterone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer. A sur- veillance mammogram obtained in the previous month had reportedly been normal. She had re- ceived three vaccines against severe acute respi- ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medications included atorvastatin, amlodipine, levothyroxine, and tamoxifen. A rash had oc- curred after the previous use of hydrochlorothia- zide. She was married and lived in coastal Massa- chusetts. She drank wine rarely and did not use tobacco or other substances. Her family history was notable for a maternal aunt with thyroid disease and a child with vitiligo.\nOn examination, the temporal  temperature\nwas 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 68 beats per minute, the blood pressure 173/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. A few scattered erythematous mac- ules were present on the abdomen, including a well-healed punch-biopsy site. A few telangiecta- sias were observed on the face. There was no rash on the face or scalp, and no sclerodactyly was observed. The hair was normal in pattern and distribution. There was no conjunctival in- jection. Extraocular movements were normal except for abduction of the right eye, which was limited and caused pain. There was no proptosis or lid lag. Visual acuity was 20/25 in the left eye and 20/40 with red color desaturation in the right eye. The right optic disk appeared pale as com- pared with the left optic disk. The remainder of the general and neurologic examination was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram was normal. The com- plete blood count and blood levels of electro- lytes, calcium, albumin, and globulin were nor- mal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 6 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 0.6 mg per liter. Screening tests for antibodies to hepatitis B virus core antigen, hepatitis C virus, histone, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative, as were tests for Lyme disease antibodies, syphilis antibodies, rheumatoid fac- tor, and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM; varicella\u2013 zoster virus IgG was detected. A test for SARS- CoV-2 RNA, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and serum and urine toxicology screens were also negative.\nA lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with an opening pressure of 14 cm of water. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed rare mononuclear cells and no organisms. The CSF glucose level was 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were no nucle- ated cells present.\nOn the second day, testing for antibodies to bartonella was negative. The levels of angioten- sin-converting enzyme, C3, and C4 were normal, as were the results of serum free light-chain testing, serum protein electrophoresis, and uri- nalysis. The IgG4 level was 137.3 mg per deciliter (reference range, 3.9 to 86.4); the levels of other IgG subclasses were normal. Testing for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 antibodies was negative, as was CSF testing for cryptococcal antigen and varicella\u2013zoster virus IgM.\nDr. Ford: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no lymphadenopathy; there was hepatic steatosis and a 2-mm right apical nodule. MRI of the head and whole spine, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed asymmetric enhancement surrounding the intraorbital and intracanalicular segments of the right optic-nerve sheath and intraconal fat. No abnormal spinal cord enhancement was ob- served. Ultrasonography of the temporal arteries showed no halo sign.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page). Imaging Studies.\nCT of the head was performed. Coronal and axial images (Panels A and B, respectively) show ill\u2011defined stranding of the intraconal fat in the right orbit (arrows). MRI of the head, neck, and orbits was also performed. Coronal and axial T2\u2011weighted, fat\u2011suppressed images (Panels C and D, respectively) show high signal intensity in the right optic\u2011nerve sheath with stranding of the intraconal fat (arrows). Coronal and axial T1\u2011weighted, fat\u2011suppressed images (Panels E and F, respectively), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, show enhancement of the right optic\u2011nerve sheath with ill\u2011defined enhancement of the intraconal fat (arrows). The optic nerve itself is largely spared.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "Neurologic Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome;SLE-Associated Optic Perineuritis;Neurosarcoidosis and IgG4-Related Disease ",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Janeth M. Yinh: This 67-year-old woman initially presented with a photosensitive rash that had developed while she was receiving hydrochloro- thiazide; laboratory tests were positive for anti- nuclear antibodies (ANA), including antibodies against Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome\u2013related antigen A (SSA). Given that hydrochlorothiazide is known to be a common trigger of drug-induced sub- acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus,1 one can- not help but consider the possibility that an au- toimmune condition could have led to this patient\u2019s symptoms. However, a biopsy of the rash a few weeks after the initial presentation showed findings consistent with an allergic re- action that was presumed to be related to hydro- chlorothiazide. Whether the rash was associated with the ocular symptoms was unclear at that time, but the results of the skin biopsy were not consistent with a dermatologic diagnosis of sub- acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, autoim- mune disease, or vasculitis.\nThe patient\u2019s course was complicated by acute\nsixth cranial nerve palsy that alternated from the left eye to the right eye. The initial left sixth cranial nerve palsy was self-limited and was pre- sumed to be a microvascular event. Eight weeks later, a funduscopic examination revealed contra- lateral findings indicative of acute right sixth cranial nerve palsy with optic-nerve compromise. Results of repeat tests for inflammatory markers (the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level) and basic laboratory tests were normal, and testing for Lyme disease was nega- tive. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head, neck, and orbits revealed a grossly spared optic nerve with evidence of edema in- volving the perineural and intraconal fat of the right eye.\nWhen the anatomical trajectory of the sixth cranial nerve was tracked to localize the site of injury,2 there was no evidence of hemorrhagic or ischemic microvascular disease at the brain stem in this patient, who had risk factors for small- vessel disease. She did not have meningeal en- hancement at the subarachnoid portion of the nerve or CSF pleocytosis, which would be sug- gestive of inflammatory or infectious meningitis. Serologic and CSF testing for infectious diseases was also negative. There was no history of trauma or evidence of elevated intracranial pressure, and magnetic resonance angiography did not reveal any vascular anomalies or thrombosis at the cavernous sinus portion of the nerve trajectory. Edema of the optic perineural fat was seen at the point where the optic nerve traverses the optic canal into the orbit. Intraconal fat edema extended to the adjacent orbital fissure, resulting in injury of the traversing sixth cranial nerve and, consequently, right oculomotor dysfunction. Orbital apex syn- drome, also called Jacod\u2019s syndrome, is character- ized by vision impairment from optic neuropathy and ophthalmoplegia due to the involvement of the motor nerves in the anatomical region of the orbital apex, as was seen in this case.3\n\nOptic Perineuritis\nOptic perineuritis is characterized by inflamma- tion restricted to the nerve sheath, whereas in- flammation of the optic-nerve axons occurs with optic neuritis. Primary optic perineuritis is typi- cally unilateral and idiopathic in nature. Bilat- eral idiopathic optic perineuritis is rare, and bi- lateral findings should prompt a search for an underlying infection such as syphilis, tuberculosis, herpes simplex virus infection, or herpes zoster; a systemic autoimmune disease such as antineu- trophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis, giant-cell arteritis, myelin oligodendro- cyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease, sar- coidosis, Graves\u2019 disease, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, or IgG4-related disease; or a malignant condition such as leukemia or primary or metastatic cancer.\n\nWhat caused the optic perineuritis in this patient? The distinction between primary optic perineuritis and optic neuritis with perineuritis is relevant because the cause, manifestations, treatment, and prognosis differ between the two conditions. Autoimmune demyelinating disorders that can cause optic neuritis include multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disor- der (NMOSD), and MOG antibody disease. These diseases are unlikely to result in inflammation of the optic-nerve sheath without the presence of prominent parenchymal nerve enhancement. Swelling of the orbital soft tissue and oculomotor dysfunction are also atypical of these demyelin- ating disorders.5\nAlthough Graves\u2019 disease, systemic lupus ery-\nthematosus (SLE), and MOG antibody disease can be associated with both optic perineuritis and optic neuritis, these autoimmune diseases are more frequently associated with optic peri- neuritis. This patient had autoimmune findings that included a remote history of Graves\u2019 disease with orbitopathy, a family history of vitiligo, and positive ANA and anti-SSA antibody tests.\nReactivation of thyroid eye disease, which can occur spontaneously or in association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, should be considered.6 The timing of her vaccinations against SARS- CoV-2 was relatively distant, and the extraocu- lar muscle enlargement associated with thyroid eye disease was not present in this patient. Testing for common infections that can lead to perineuritis was unremarkable in this patient, and she had no major risk factors for infection. Optic perineuritis resulting from malignant infiltration, leptomeningeal disease, or a para- neoplastic syndrome would be a diagnostic alter- native for which an invasive tissue biopsy could be considered for confirmation after a negative workup for autoimmune and autoinf lammatory conditions.\nSLE-Associated Optic Perineuritis\nSLE-associated optic perineuritis should be consid- ered. This patient had a positive ANA test. How- ever, other classic features of SLE were absent, and the results of other autoimmune-specific tests (e.g., tests for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA, anti- Smith, and antiphospholipid antibodies) that would allow for the classification of SLE accord- ing to established criteria were negative in this patient.7\n \n\nNeurologic Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s Syndrome\nA positive test for anti-SSA antibodies can be associated with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, SLE, sub- acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, or neonatal lupus. In addition, an increased frequency in the occurrence of a positive test for anti\u2013aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies has been described in patients with NMOSD.8 Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome associated with optic perineuritis is rare, but cranial neu- ropathies are not an uncommon manifestation of neurologic Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. Although this patient had no history of sicca complex or ex- traglandular manifestations, which are findings typical of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, central nervous system involvement may precede the diagnosis of primary Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome.9 Longitudinal monitoring for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome should be performed, along with testing for anti-AQP4 and anti-MOG antibodies to rule out NMOSD and MOG antibody disease, respectively.\n\nNeurosarcoidosis and IgG4-Related Disease Cranial neuropathy resulting from granuloma- tous invasion of one or more cranial nerves occurs in approximately 60% of patients with neuro- sarcoidosis. However, lung involvement is absent in only approximately 10% of patients with sar- coidosis.10 Optic neuropathy is seen in 5 to 9% of patients with IgG4-related disease with oph-\nthalmic manifestations, and this diagnosis should be considered in this patient, given the mild ele- vation of the serum IgG4 level. Nonetheless, serum testing for IgG4 has a low sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of IgG4-related dis- ease; the level is normal in 30 to 40% of pa- tients.11 Further evaluation for extrapulmonary sarcoidosis and for IgG4-related disease with other organ involvement, performed with the use of whole-body positron-emission tomogra- phy, can be considered to identify abnormalities for which a diagnostic biopsy may be indicated.\n\nSmall-Vessel and Medium-Vessel Vasculitis Optic perineuritis can result from vasculitis in- volving small and medium vessels that supply the orbital segment of the optic nerve, which can occur in the context of giant-cell arteritis or ANCA-associated vasculitis. These conditions are occasionally associated with optic perineuritis.4,5,12 The normal levels of acute-phase reactants and\nthe absence of systemic inflammation would be unusual findings for giant-cell arteritis or ANCA-associated vasculitis. A negative ultrasound of the temporal arteries makes the diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis less likely, and a normal eryth- rocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level would occur in only 0.8% of confirmed cases of temporal arteritis.13\nOptic perineuritis has been increasingly recog- nized as a feature of granulomatosis with polyan- giitis.5,14 Limited forms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis can manifest with neuro-ophthalmic findings and with minimal or no systemic find- ings, lacking components of the full triad.15 If other causes of optic perineuritis have been ruled out in the patient, and there is no low-risk site for a diagnostic biopsy, ANCA testing with reflex testing for antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3) is a highly specific and accessible testing procedure with prompt results that could help to confirm a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis in the presence of relevant clinical features.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Reza Zonozi: The diagnostic test performed in this case was serum ANCA testing. ANCAs are autoantibodies directed against antigens in the cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils and mono- cytes. There are many target antigens, including bactericidal\u2013permeability-increasing protein, lac- toferrin, cathepsin G, elastase, MPO, and PR3.16 However, only ANCAs directed against MPO or PR3 are associated with systemic vasculitis.\nANCA testing includes two distinct tests: a microscopic examination with indirect immuno- fluorescence staining and an enzyme-linked im- munosorbent assay (ELISA). Indirect immuno- f luorescence staining can detect ANCAs, but the findings are nonspecific. Positive indirect immu- nofluorescence staining can reveal ANCA with a cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA) or with a perinucle- ar pattern (p-ANCA). However, a positive test does not specify which autoantigen is being targeted. An antigen-specific ELISA for MPO and PR3 is essential to confirm the diagnosis.17 Moreover, the presence of ANAs can lead to an erroneous interpretation of indirect immunof luorescence staining as positive for p-ANCA.18 This point fur- ther underscores the importance of the ELISA results. After this patient\u2019s serum was incubated with ethanol-fixed human neutrophils, indirect immunof luorescence staining was positive for p-ANCA. The ELISA was positive for antibodies to MPO (23 U; reference value, <2.8) and was negative for antibodies to PR3.\nANCA-associated vasculitis refers to systemic necrotizing vasculitis that predominantly affects small vessels and includes a spectrum of clinical phenotypes \u2014 namely, granulomatosis with poly- angiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and isolated pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glo- merulonephritis (renal-limited vasculitis).19 The phenotypes can differ with respect to the pre- dominant clinical features, the detection of granulomatous lesions on histologic examina- tion, the ANCA serotype (in which PR3 anti- bodies are typically detected with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and MPO antibodies are typi cally detected with microscopic polyangiitis), and the presence of asthma and eosinophilia; however, the phenotypes can have overlapping features.\nA tissue biopsy is the preferred method for the diagnosis of vasculitis; however, an acceptable alternative is a positive test for ANCA to MPO or PR3 in patients who present with clini- cal features of vasculitis.20 In a meta-analysis of the diagnostic value of ANCA testing, a combined ANCA testing system incorporating indirect im- munofluorescence staining and the ELISA spe- cific for MPO and PR3 had 99% specificity and 85% sensitivity.17 The usefulness of these find- ings depends on the pretest probability of vascu- litis for any given clinical scenario. For example, in a patient with rapidly progressive glomerulo- nephritis, the probability of vasculitis before ANCA testing is approximately 50%.21 A positive test for ANCA to MPO or PR3 increases the probability of vasculitis to 99%.17\nIn this patient, the salient clinical features are bilateral, asynchronous sixth cranial nerve palsies and optic perineuritis. With some extrapolation from the literature, we can conservatively esti- mate a pretest probability of vasculitis of ap- proximately 10%, with a possible increase to approximately 25% after other causes have been ruled out.5,22 After we factor in the positive MPO ANCA test, the post-test probability of vasculitis is greater than 90%.17 This probability is further strengthened because the MPO ANCA level is unequivocally positive, relative to the cutoff value. This finding supports a diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n\n",
