    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Erika J. Parisi (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman with a history of Crohn\u2019s disease was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and fever.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 years before the current admission, when nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain in the right upper quadrant developed. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. The right upper quadrant was tender on palpation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed mild dilatation and fecalization of the distal small intestine. A diagnosis of small-bowel obstruction was suspected, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for bowel rest and administration of intravenous f luids. On the second hospital day, all the symptoms had resolved, and the patient was dis- charged home with a presumed diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis.\nOne month later, the patient was evaluated in a gastroenterology clinic affili- ated with a second hospital. She reported ongoing bloating, intermittent abdomi- nal pain on the right side, and two or three bowel movements per day with loose stools without blood or mucus. She had no weight loss or fever. Physical examina- tion was normal. CT with small-bowel enterography revealed mild circumferential wall thickening of the proximal ascending colon and distal ileum and prominent lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant. Colonoscopy was notable for erythema- tous, granular, hemorrhagic, ulcerated mucosa in the proximal ascending colon and cecum. Biopsy specimens of the ileum and ascending colon showed normal mucosa; a biopsy specimen of the cecum showed evidence of active chronic colitis that was consistent with Crohn\u2019s disease. Mesalamine therapy was initiated, with a decrease in the bloating and abdominal pain but no change in the frequency of bowel movements.\nSeven months before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in a\ngastroenterology clinic affiliated with this hospital. She reported postprandial bloating and epigastric pain, as well as two or three bowel movements per day with hard stools and associated straining. Phys- ical examination was normal. The fecal calpro- tectin level was 243 \u03bcg per gram (reference range,\n<50). An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacte- rium tuberculosis was negative. The blood lipase level was normal, as were the results of liver- function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Results of esophagogastro- duodenoscopy were normal, but gastric biopsy specimens showed evidence of Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Colonoscopy (Fig. 1) revealed shallow ulcerations, edema, and friability in the cecum and a segment of the ascending colon. Findings on examination of a biopsy specimen of the cecum were interpreted as consistent with severe active colitis, with marked ulceration but with- out dysplasia or granulomas; immunohistochem- ical staining for cytomegalovirus was negative. The H. pylori gastritis was treated with lansopra- zole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin, with near resolution of the bloating and upper abdominal pain. Five months before the current admission, mesalamine was discontinued and adalimumab was initiated for the treatment of Crohn\u2019s disease. Three months before the current admission, bloating and epigastric pain recurred; stools con- tained blood and mucus, and bowel movements increased in frequency to three or four times per day. Two months before the current admission, the patient was again evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic affiliated with this hospital. Physical examination was normal. The fecal calprotec- tin level was 2144 \u03bcg per gram. The adalimumab level and antiadalimumab antibody titer were interpreted as low. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Aileen O\u2019Shea: Magnetic resonance enter- ography of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 2), performed after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed thickening and edema of the ascending colon, cecum, and ter- minal ileum, with surrounding changes consis- tent with inflammation and marked contrast enhancement. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction.\nDr. Parisi: The frequency of the adalimumab injections was increased, and prednisone therapy was initiated. However, 7 weeks before the cur- rent admission, nausea and vomiting developed, abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain on palpation of the epigas- tric area and tachycardia that resolved with the administration of intravenous fluids. The blood lipase level was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The fecal calprotectin level was more than 3000 \u03bcg per gram. Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy were normal, and biopsy specimens showed resolution of the previous gastritis. Colonoscopy revealed severe inflammation with deep ulcerations in the right side of the colon, extending from the area 1 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to the hepatic f lexure. Findings on examination of a biopsy specimen obtained from the right side of the colon were interpreted as consistent with severe active colitis; immunohistochemical staining for cytomegalovirus was negative. Treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids was initiated, with resolution of the bloody bowel movements. Adalimumab was discontinued, and infliximab was initiated. Epigastric pain decreased with the initiation of a bland diet, and on the seventh hospital day, the patient was discharged home with a plan to complete a 14-day course of em- pirical ciprofloxacin and metronidazole and a 6-week tapering course of oral prednisone.\nDuring the last week of the prednisone course,\nfever and diaphoresis developed and abdominal pain worsened. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. She reported 6 days of increased bloating and 1 day of sharp abdominal pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 9 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She reported that her stools did not contain blood or mucus and had not changed in consistency and her bowel movements had not changed in fre- quency. There was no joint pain, rash, or eye redness or pain. Other history included Clostridium difficile colitis (which had been treated with oral vancomycin 29 months before presentation), polycystic ovarian syndrome, dysmenorrhea, in- fertility (which had led to in vitro fertilization), and piriformis syndrome. Surgical history in- cluded appendectomy 20 years before presenta- tion, right inguinal hernia repair 2 years before presentation, and right knee arthroscopic chon- droplasty 3 months before presentation. There were no known drug allergies. Medications in cluded infliximab, pantoprazole, prednisone, pregabalin, and sucralfate. Family history in- cluded coronary artery disease in her mother and diabetes and hypertension in her father. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had moved to the United States from India 13 years before presentation,and she lived with her husband and son in New England.\nOn physical examination, the temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, the pulse 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 57.5 kg, the height 157 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.2. The abdomen was nondistended, with normal bowel sounds. There was tender- ness on palpation of the right lower, right upper, and left upper quadrants, without rebound or guarding. The anus appeared normal; there were two nonbleeding external hemorrhoids. The pa- tient had no joint swelling, rash, or oral lesions. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood lactic acid level was normal, as were the results of liver-function tests and urinalysis. The fecal calprotectin level was 1372 \u03bcg per gram. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Exam- ination of a stool specimen for the C. difficile toxin was negative.\nDr. O\u2019Shea: A chest radiograph showed no con-\nsolidation or pulmonary edema. CT of the abdo- men and pelvis (Fig. 2), performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse thickening and enhancement of the ascending colon, cecum, and terminal ileum, with surrounding changes consistent with in- f lammation, minimal free peritoneal fluid, and multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (mea- suring \u22649 mm) in the right lower quadrant.\nDr. Parisi: Intravenous f luids were adminis- tered, tachycardia resolved, and the patient was admitted to this hospital. Glucocorticoids and piperacillin in combination with tazobactam were administered intravenously, with a minimal de- crease in the bloating and abdominal pain. On the fifth hospital day, right hemicolectomy was performed, and a diagnosis was made.\n\nFigure 1. Colonoscopic Images.\nImages obtained during colonoscopy performed 7 months before the current admission, before the initiation of anti\u2013 tumor necrosis factor therapy, show a normal terminal ileum (Panel A) and inflammation involving primarily the cecum, with a patulous ileocecal valve (Panel B).\n\nFigure 2. Imaging Studies of the Abdomen.\nImages obtained during magnetic resonance enterography performed 3 months before the current admission (Panels A and B) show thickening and hyperenhancement of the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon. The coronal, T1\u2011weighted, contrast\u2011enhanced image (Panel A) shows prominent mesenteric lymph nodes (arrow), and the axial, T2\u2011weighted, fat\u2011suppressed image obtained at the level of the cecal pole (Panel B) shows marked pericolonic ede\u2011 ma (arrow). In addition, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed at the time of the current presentation, after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A coronal, reformatted image (Panel C) shows persistent, con\u2011 tiguous thickening of the terminal ileum, cecum, and ascending colon (arrow), and an axial image obtained at the level of the cecum (Panel D) shows pericolonic stranding, edema, and a prominent mesenteric lymph node (arrow).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Hamed Khalili: This 38-year-old woman had several years of intermittent bloating, abdomi- nal pain, and diarrhea. Initial endoscopic ex- amination revealed findings consistent with Crohn\u2019s disease. However, despite appropriate medical treatment, she had progressive worsen- ing of clinical symptoms, and subsequent en- doscopy revealed progressive mucosal inflam- mation. The first question in developing a differential diagnosis is to determine whether Crohn\u2019s disease is the cause of this patient\u2019s presenting symptoms.\nCrohn\u2019s Disease\nCrohn\u2019s disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that leads to mucosal inflammation characterized by erythema and ulcerations. Biop- sy specimens of the bowel mucosa show features of chronicity, which were seen in this patient, and may also show noncaseating granulomas. Although the incidence of Crohn\u2019s disease is highest among persons between 20 and 29 years of age, Crohn\u2019s disease can affect persons in all age groups and is a possible diagnosis in this patient.1 However, several aspects of the pa- tient\u2019s presentation are atypical of Crohn\u2019s dis- ease. First, endoscopy revealed inflammation pre- dominantly in the cecum, whereas inflammation in the terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and right side of the colon (both the cecum and the as- cending colon) is more characteristic of Crohn\u2019s disease. Furthermore, the symptoms appeared to worsen while she was receiving anti\u2013tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy with adalimumab and infliximab. Although Crohn\u2019s disease may be refractory to medical treatment, the absence of any response to standard therapy is uncommon, and therefore I will consider other potential di- agnoses to explain this patient\u2019s presentation.\nOther Immune-Mediated Disorders\nSarcoidosis and Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease are immune- mediated disorders with associated gastrointes- tinal symptoms that can mimic Crohn\u2019s disease, and they are important diagnoses to consider in this patient. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous dis- ease that typically affects women 20 to 40 years of age. Gastrointestinal involvement is rare, and when it is observed, primarily the stomach is involved.2 The diagnosis requires identification of noncaseating granulomas, typically without evidence of active inflammation. This patient had normal results on esophagogastroduodenos- copy 7 months before the current admission, and previous mucosal biopsy specimens had shown evidence of active inflammation without granulomas; these findings make sarcoidosis an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is another granulomatous disease that typically affects young adults.3 Gastrointestinal involve- ment is commonly observed, with endoscopic features similar to those of Crohn\u2019s disease; the terminal ileum is the most common site of involvement. However, gastrointestinal manifestations of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease are often preceded by years of mucocutaneous ulcers. This patient had no history of mucocutaneous ulcers, and thus Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease is unlikely.\n\nInfection\nSeveral gastrointestinal infections are associated with symptoms that can mimic Crohn\u2019s disease. Patients with amebic colitis can have chronic symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloody stool.4 Inflammation most com- monly involves the right side of the colon. How- ever, this patient had last been in India 13 years earlier and had not recently traveled to an area in which amebic colitis is endemic (i.e., Asia, Africa, or South America). Furthermore, she did not have the characteristic flask-shaped ulcers in colonic mucosa. Patients with salmonella, yersinia, and campylobacter infections can also present with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Inflam- mation that involves the right side of the colon and terminal ileum, which was seen in this case, could be consistent with these infections. How- ever, features of chronicity in mucosal biopsy specimens are typically absent and were present in this case.\nIntestinal Tuberculosis\nIntestinal tuberculosis can mimic Crohn\u2019s dis- ease and present a challenging diagnostic dilemma. Intestinal tuberculosis most commonly in- volves the right side of the colon, particularly the cecum. Presenting symptoms vary and can in- clude abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and partial small-bowel obstruction. Histologic assessment of mucosal biopsy specimens reveals granulomas in 50 to 80% of cases.5-7 Identifica- tion of acid-fast bacilli in a smear or culture is the most reliable method of diagnosing intesti- nal tuberculosis. Unfortunately, acid-fast stain and culture have low sensitivity.\nThe ability to distinguish between Crohn\u2019s\ndisease and intestinal tuberculosis has gained increased attention as the incidence of Crohn\u2019s disease has risen in developing countries, where the prevalence of tuberculosis is high.8 Algo- rithms have been developed to help distinguish between these two diseases.9,10 Features that fa- vor a diagnosis of Crohn\u2019s disease are extraintestinal manifestations, positive testing for anti\u2013 Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, and involvement of the perianal area or left side of the colon.\n \n\nFeatures that are suggestive of intestinal tuber- culosis include a positive interferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis, a patulous ileocecal valve, cecal involvement, pulmonary disease, and the presence of granulomas.\nThis patient had a negative interferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis. Although this assay has very high specificity (>95%), the sensitivity is only approximately 80%. In a patient from India, a negative test does not rule out latent or active tuberculosis.11 Does the elevated fecal calprotec- tin level help distinguish between Crohn\u2019s dis- ease and intestinal tuberculosis? Inflammation in the bowel mucosa causes activated neutro- phils to release calprotectin into the gut lumen, leading to elevated fecal calprotectin levels, as seen in this patient. Although the fecal calpro- tectin level can be used to monitor treatment response in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, it is not helpful in distinguishing intestinal tubercu- losis from Crohn\u2019s disease, because the fecal cal- protectin level may also be elevated in patients with infectious diarrhea.\nAlthough the laboratory test results in this\ncase are not helpful in distinguishing between Crohn\u2019s disease and intestinal tuberculosis, the endoscopic findings may point us toward the correct diagnosis. The colonoscopic findings ob- tained 7 months before the current admission, including a normal-appearing terminal ileum and a patulous ileocecal valve with mucosal in- flammation confined to the cecum, favor a diag- nosis of intestinal tuberculosis. Combined with the absence of a response to standard medical therapy for Crohn\u2019s disease, the endoscopic find- ings are highly suggestive of intestinal tuberculosis.\nCould this patient\u2019s treatment with anti-TNF\ntherapy have caused reactivation of tuberculosis in the gastrointestinal tract? Tuberculosis reacti- vation associated with anti-TNF therapy has been widely reported in the literature. In specific, re- activation of tuberculosis in the gastrointestinal tract has been reported in patients receiving anti- TNF therapy for rheumatologic conditions.12 However, when reactivation of tuberculosis oc- curs in patients receiving anti-TNF therapy for inflammatory bowel disease, it does not com- monly involve the gastrointestinal tract.13 Over- all, this patient\u2019s endoscopic findings before the initiation of anti-TNF therapy and the fact that her disease worsened while she was receiving anti-TNF therapy suggest an underlying diagno- sis of intestinal tuberculosis. She underwent ileo- colonic resection for presumed refractory Crohn\u2019s disease, and I suspect the diagnostic testing to evaluate for intestinal tuberculosis was acid-fast stain and culture or nucleic-acid testing of the resected specimen for M. tuberculosis.\n\n",
