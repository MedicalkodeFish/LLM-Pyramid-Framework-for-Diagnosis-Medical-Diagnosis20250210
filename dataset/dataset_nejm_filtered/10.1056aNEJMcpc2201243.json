    "Primary Symptom": "A Newborn Girl with Hypoglycemia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Numa P. Perez (Surgery): A newborn girl was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient\u2019s mother was a 27-year-old woman (gravida 1, para 1) who had received prenatal care at another hospital. At 34 weeks of gestation, an ultrasono- graphic survey of the fetal anatomy had reportedly revealed an avascular intraab- dominal cystic mass that was located near the bladder and measured 3.7 cm by\n2.1 cm by 2.0 cm. A sacral dimple was noted. The  patient\u2019s mother was referred  to the maternal\u2013fetal medicine clinic of the other hospital; she declined follow-up imaging and amniocentesis.\nAt 37 weeks 6 days of gestation, premature labor occurred, and the patient\u2019s mother was taken to a second hospital. A fetal heart tracing was noted to be non- reactive with minimal variability. The fetal biophysical profile score was 4 out of 8, indicating decreased breathing motion and body movement but normal tone and amniotic fluid volume. An emergency cesarean section was performed.\nOn delivery, the newborn had limp tone and poor respiratory effort. The birth weight was 2963 g (19th percentile), the length 48 cm (20th percentile), and the head circumference 35  cm (77th percentile). The Apgar scores at 1 minute and     5 minutes were 7 and 9, respectively. The patient was transferred to the newborn nursery.\nIn the nursery, the patient was noted to be jittery. Oxygen therapy was admin- istered through a low-flow nasal cannula. The blood glucose level was reportedly less than 10 mg per deciliter (0.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]) and the bilirubin level 16.0 mg per deci- liter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 2.0 to 15.0 mg per deciliter [34 to 257 \u03bcmol per liter]). A chest radiograph showed a normal cardiac shadow and findings in- dicative of retained fetal lung fluid. The newborn was fed, and a bolus of dextrose was administered; however, a repeat blood glucose level was 2 mg per deciliter (0.1 mmol per liter). A continuous infusion of dextrose was started. Phototherapy and empirical treatment with ampicillin and gentamicin were administered.\nDuring the next 3 days, the patient\u2019s blood glucose level remained low, with a maximum level of 61 mg per deciliter (3.4 mmol per liter), even though the glucose infusion rate was in- creased and enteral feeding with formula was initiated. On the fourth day of life, she was transferred to the neonatal ICU of this hospital for further treatment.\nOn admission to the neonatal ICU, additional history was obtained. Before the ultrasono- graphic survey at 34 weeks of gestation, the pregnancy had been normal. The patient\u2019s mother had taken prenatal vitamins. Prenatal maternal screening had been negative for gonorrhea, chla- mydia, and syphilis, as well as human immuno- deficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and group B streptococcal infections; there was evidence of immunity to rubella virus. The maternal ABO blood type was AB, Rh positive. The newborn\u2019s parents had immigrated to the United States from the Caribbean and now lived in a suburb in New England. The patient\u2019s mother, father, and half brother were healthy.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and appeared comfortable. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 148 beats per minute, the blood pressure 79/45 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 49 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 98% while she was breathing ambient air. The anterior and posterior fontanelles were flat and soft. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft without distention, ten- derness, or palpable masses. Two sacral dimples with visible bases were noted. The female geni- talia appeared normal, but the anus was dis- placed anteriorly.\nThe blood glucose level was 60 mg per deci- liter (3.3 mmol per liter) while the patient was receiving dextrose at a glucose infusion rate of\n10.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per min- ute. The total bilirubin level was 20.4 mg per deciliter (349 \u03bcmol per liter). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sjirk J. Westra: A chest radiograph showed\nclear lungs. Abdominal and pelvic ultrasonogra- phy (Fig. 1) revealed a large solid\u2013cystic mass anterior to the sacrum that measured 2.7 cm by\n3.0 cm by 5.7 cm, with the rectum passing ante- riorly to the mass. Results of spinal ultrasonog- raphy were normal, as were results of cranial ultrasonography performed through the anterior fontanelle. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen, pelvis, and spine (Fig. 2) showed a presacral solid\u2013cystic  mass that measured 2.7 cm by 2.8 cm by 5.9 cm, with a small extension into the ischiorectal fossa on the right side. There was no evidence of ab- dominal lymphadenopathy or involvement of the sacral spine.\nDr. Perez: During the next few days, the patient continued to receive dextrose at a high glucose infusion rate to maintain normoglycemia. At 5 days of life, a small bowel movement occurred. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level was 1173 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210) and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin level 10.7 mIU per milliliter (reference range, <1.1).\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sarbattama Sen: Blood glucose levels are physi- ologically low immediately after birth and ap- proach levels observed in older children or adults after 72 hours of life.1 This newborn girl had persistent hypoglycemia postnatally, for which she received a continuous infusion of dextrose to maintain normoglycemia. To deter- mine the cause of her prolonged hypoglycemia, it is helpful to review the physiology of postnatal glycemic adaptation.\nPhysiology of Postnatal Glycemic Adaptation The primary source of energy for the fetus is glucose, which the mother provides to the fetus through a concentration gradient.2-4 The fetal glucose level is approximately 80% of the mater- nal level. The glucose level at which insulin is secreted is lower in a fetus than in a newborn, given that the function of insulin in utero is primarily related to fetal growth rather than glucose regulation.5 Before birth, the maternal and fetal glucose levels increase until clamping of the umbilical cord, when the maternal glu- cose supply to the infant is interrupted. Thereaf- ter, the neonatal glucose level decreases, reach- ing a nadir between 1 and 3 hours after birth.6 In response to the falling glucose level, the se- cretion of insulin typically decreases while the secretion of glucagon and catecholamines in- creases, stimulating glucose production through gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. The cate- cholamine surge associated with hypoglycemia increases the production of lactate, which serves as an alternative fuel for gluconeogenesis.6 Ulti- mately, the glucose level at which insulin is se- creted by pancreatic beta cells typically adjusts to the higher, adult threshold,1 allowing the in- fant to maintain normoglycemia.7,8\nTypical Risk Factors for Neonatal Hypoglycemia\nThere are maternal, fetal, and neonatal condi- tions that can confer a predisposition for de- layed or exaggerated glycemic transition in an infant and potentially lead to neonatal hypo- glycemia. These conditions are associated with three mechanisms: decreased insulin sensitivity, decreased stores of glycogen, and increased insulin secretion. Infants who are born pre- term or are small for gestational age may be affected by any or all of these mechanisms.9-11 Infants who are large for gestational age are thought to be affected by increased insulin secretion in utero that resulted in fetal over- growth, regardless of whether the mother had received a diagnosis of diabetes.12 When a mother has diabetes, fetal hyperinsulinism develops in response to maternal hyperglyce- mia.13 In this infant, none of these typical prenatal or perinatal risk factors for hypogly- cemia were identified.\nIn the absence of these typical risk factors,\nother causes of severe, prolonged hypoglycemia should be considered. These include foci of ectop- ic or dysregulated insulin production (congenital hyperinsulinism or another focus of ectopic insulin production), metabolic diseases (fatty- acid oxidation defects, organic acidemias, urea- cycle defects, or glycogen-storage disease), ge- netic syndromes (the Prader\u2013Willi syndrome, the Beckwith\u2013Wiedemann syndrome, the Kabuki syndrome, the Sotos syndrome, or the Turner syndrome), and endocrinopathies (hypopituita- rism, growth-hormone deficiency, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia).\nDiagnostic Fasting Study\nA diagnostic fasting study could determine whether the hypoglycemia is due to hyperinsu- linism.14 During the study, all exogenous (enteral and parenteral) sources of glucose are held. Once the blood glucose level is less than 50 mg per deciliter (2.8 mmol per liter), the following levels are obtained: insulin, free fatty acids, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, lactate, cortisol, growth hormone, acylcarnitines, and urine or- ganic acids. In the context of hyperinsulinism, the insulin level is inappropriately high, whereas the insulin level is typically suppressed under conditions of hypoglycemia. Inappropriately high insulin secretion leads to suppression of the li- pase level, which results in low levels of free fatty acids and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and also in- hibits amino acid  breakdown, thus resulting in  a low ammonia level. The lactate level may be high, given the ongoing catecholamine response. A diagnostic fasting study also provides infor- mation about central endocrinopathies, such as hypopituitarism (identified by detection of a low cortisol level), growth-hormone deficiency, fatty- acid oxidation defects (identified by assessment of the acylcarnitine profile), and urea-cycle de- fects (identified by assessment of the urine or- ganic acid profile).\n\nHyperinsulinism and Sacrococcygeal Teratoma\nIf a diagnostic fasting study confirms the presence of hyperinsulinism, the next question is whether the hyperinsulinism is related to the other prominent  clinical finding in  this case:  a cystic mass in the sacral region. By far, the most common pathologic masses that occur in this anatomical location and with this radiographic appearance are sacrococcygeal teratomas, which consist of heterogeneous, pleiotropic cells.15,16 In a patient with a sacrococcygeal tera- toma, hyperinsulinism can be caused by a syn- drome that has led to the sacrococcygeal tera- toma and hyperinsulism or by a focus of inappropriate insulin secretion within the tera- toma (or both).\nThe Sotos syndrome is a rare disorder that is associated with hyperinsulinism and sacrococ- cygeal teratomas. Newborns with the Sotos syn- drome can present with few physical manifesta- tions.17 The Sotos syndrome is identified by the detection of pathogenic variants in the gene NSD1; more than 380 variants in this gene have been linked to this disease.18\nTrisomy 13 has been associated with sacrococ- cygeal teratomas and hypoglycemia in rare cases,but in this context, hypoglycemia is less likely to be related to hyperinsulinism than to growth restriction and poor glycogen stores. Newborns with trisomy 13 typically present with a constel- lation of physical manifestations, which were not described in this patient.19\nA focus of ectopic insulin production within the sacrococcygeal teratoma can be identified by means of abdominal and pelvic positron-emis- sion tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodihy- droxyphenylalanine.20 Alternatively, if surgical resection of the mass is planned, pathological examination of the resection specimen can in- clude an evaluation for islet cells.\nOn the basis of the patient\u2019s presentation with persistent hypoglycemia in the context of a probable sacrococcygeal teratoma, I suspect that the Sotos syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. To establish this diagnosis, targeted sequencing should be performed to identify variants in NSD1. Alternatively, whole-exome sequencing could be performed in the infant, as well as in the parents if possible (trio approach), to iden- tify pathogenic variants associated with genetic disorders that could be consistent with the pa- tient\u2019s clinical presentation, including the Sotos syndrome.\nThe Sotos syndrome is a genetic condition with cardinal features of overgrowth, develop- mental delays, and a characteristic facial appear- ance.32 Overgrowth may occur prenatally or postnatally and can manifest as macrocephaly and tall stature. Among patients with the Sotos syndrome, neurodevelopmental findings vary but can include developmental delays, intellec- tual disability, learning disability, or autism spectrum disorder. The facial features seen in this patient are typical of those observed in in- fants with the Sotos syndrome; the facial fea- tures in some patients change over the course of the life span.\nSacrococcygeal teratoma has been reported as a rare presenting feature of the Sotos syn- drome.33 Other tumors can also occur with this syndrome, but the overall risk of cancer is low.\nInfants with the Sotos syndrome are recognized to be at risk for neonatal hypoglycemia due to transient hyperinsulinism. However, in one case series involving seven patients with hyperinsu- linism associated with pathogenic NSD1 vari- ants, three of the patients had persistent hyper- insulinism for which they received treatment beyond infancy.17\nBoth the biologically active teratoma and the underlying Sotos syndrome are likely causes of hyperinsulinism in this patient. Although the teratoma may have been a contributing factor initially, the persistence of hyperinsulinism after resection of the teratoma is most likely attribut- able to the diagnosis of the Sotos syndrome.\nThe patient\u2019s parents were counseled about the Sotos syndrome and told that this diagnosis explained their daughter\u2019s sacrococcygeal tera- toma, hyperinsulinism, and increased head cir- cumference. They were told to anticipate some developmental delay, the severity of which was difficult to predict. The importance of ongoing developmental supports was emphasized. They were also counseled that the risk for future pregnancies was likely to be low, given that the parents showed no clinical signs of the Sotos syndrome and that most cases of the Sotos syndrome are due to de novo genetic variants. To confirm the risk, however, the parents were offered and are pursuing genetic testing for the NSD1 variant.",

A chromosome microarray analysis and MNX1 sequencing to rule out the Currarino syn- drome were nondiagnostic. The Currarino syn- drome is associated with multiple congenital anomalies, often including sacrococcygeal tera- toma. Although this syndrome is characterized by a classic triad that includes other sacral and anorectal anomalies, and these features were absent in this patient, molecular genetic testing was still performed because the clinical spectrum of Currarino syndrome is known to be broad.\nWhen the patient was 4 months of age, she was seen in the outpatient genetics clinic. She was still receiving diazoxide treatment for hy- perinsulinism. Additional features were noted, including progressive macrocephaly, dolicho- cephaly, hypertonia, and developmental delays. Macrocephaly was associated with a head cir- cumference of 47.2 cm (>99th percentile; z score,\n+4.99). Facial features were notable for a broad forehead, posteriorly rotated ears, a flat nasal bridge, anteverted nares, and a pointed chin. MRI of the head revealed ventriculomegaly with a slight increase in the size of the lateral and third ventricles, as compared with measure- ments observed on imaging that had been per- formed in the neonatal period. Further genetic tests revealed a frameshift variant in NSD1 (c.1768_1769del, p.Leu590Ilefs*), a finding that led to the diagnosis of the Sotos syndrome.\nThe Sotos syndrome is a genetic condition with cardinal features of overgrowth, develop- mental delays, and a characteristic facial appear- ance.32 Overgrowth may occur prenatally or postnatally and can manifest as macrocephaly and tall stature.
