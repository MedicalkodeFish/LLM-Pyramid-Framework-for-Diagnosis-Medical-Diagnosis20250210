    "Primary Symptom": "A 27-Year-Old Man with Leg Weakness",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jamie Aron (Emergency Medicine): A 27-year-old man was evaluated at this hos- pital because of leg weakness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 days before the current presentation, when myalgias developed in the upper legs. He initially attributed the pain to increased physical activity while at work in construction. When he awoke on the morning of the current presentation, he could not lift his legs to move in bed or to stand up. He also had weakness in the arms, although it was less pronounced than the weakness in the legs. He asked his family to bring him to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing weakness. He had no history of trauma, back pain, or saddle anesthesia. There were no changes in sensation. He had no other relevant medical history, and he took no prescribed medications. He had moved to Boston from El Salvador 5 months before the current presentation.\nAfter arriving in Boston, the patient had begun to have increasing difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep, which he had attributed to stress. He had had loose stools but a normal appetite and was eating normally with no abdomi- nal pain, nausea, or vomiting; he estimated a weight loss of approximately 5 kg since moving to Boston. In addition, he reported that he had had trembling in his hands for several months before the current presentation, which he had also at- tributed to stress. Four days before the current presentation, he began taking an herbal supplement (sold under the brand name Nervitran) that was intended to reduce stress. He had no known allergies. He drank alcohol occasionally, had never smoked tobacco, and did not use illicit drugs. There was no family history of hypertension or liver disease; a maternal aunt had had an episode of weakness, but the patient was not aware of a diagnosis.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure\n144/79 mm Hg, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was\n21.6. Conjunctival injection was present in both eyes. Muscle strength was 4/5 on abduction of both shoulders and on flexion and extension of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Muscle strength was  5/5  on  knee  flexion  and  extension  and  3/5 on hip flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion. Sensation to light touch and tempera- ture was normal. Patellar reflexes were 3+. There was a low-amplitude, high-frequency fine tremor in the hands, which was more prominent in the left hand than in the right hand. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe complete blood count was normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. A blood toxicology screen was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen, ethanol, and tricyclic antide- pressant medications. The blood level of aspartate aminotransferase was 56 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), the alanine aminotransferase level 65 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), the alkaline phosphatase level 137 U per liter (refer- ence range, 45 to 115), the total bilirubin level 1.3 mg per deciliter (22 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.0 to 1.0 mg per deciliter [0 to 17 \u03bcmol per liter]), the potassium level 1.8 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0), the creatine kinase level 382 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400), and the aldolase level 9.9 U per liter (reference value, <7.7); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urinalysis was not performed. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, in- complete right bundle-branch block, and nonspe- cific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Po- tassium chloride was administered orally at a dose of 60 meq. Three hours later, the blood level of potassium was 4.2 mmol per liter, and the weakness in the patient\u2019s arms and legs had abated.\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis;Familial Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Andrew S. Allegretti: This 27-year-old previously healthy man presented with a 3-day history of myalgias and proximal muscle weakness that had lasted for several hours, and he was found to have severe hypokalemia. The differential di- agnosis for proximal muscle weakness is broad. The presence of severe hypokalemia in combina- tion with an abatement of symptoms after potas- sium repletion suggests that hypokalemia is the most likely cause of the muscle weakness in this patient. Therefore, I will focus my differential diagnosis on the possible causes of hypokalemia, while being mindful that the most likely diagno- sis will also need to account for the patient\u2019s more subacute symptoms of weight loss, diar- rhea, tremor, and insomnia.\nPotassium Homeostasis\nPotassium is the most abundant cation in the body, with a total body content of nearly 3500 mmol. Ninety-eight percent of the total body content of potassium is found in the intracellular f luid owing to the sodium\u2013potassium pump (Na+/K+\u2013ATPase), which actively transports it across cell membranes and leaves only about 60 mmol of potassium available in the extracellular space. A typical Western diet includes approximately 100 mmol of potassium per day. To handle this load without dangerous postprandial increases in the blood potassium level, the body must regulate the level of extracellular potassium quickly and efficiently. This occurs by means of an intracel- lular shift through the Na+/K+\u2013ATPase, which is stimulated by catecholamines and insulin. In the long term, approximately 90% of ingested potas- sium is excreted in the urine through the distal nephron, with the remainder excreted in the stool and through the skin. This patient report- ed eating normally, although we were not told whether he consumed a typical Western diet. Regardless, it is unusual for hypokalemia to develop in patients as a result of inadequate dietary intake alone because the urinary excre- tion of potassium can be reduced to as low as 20 mmol per day. Therefore, the next step in this case should focus on determining whether the cause of this patient\u2019s hypokalemia is related to renal losses, nonrenal losses, or intracellular shifts.1\nThe quantification of urinary potassium excretion is generally the first step in diagnostic testing for hypokalemia (Fig. 1). The use of either a 24-hour urine collection or a spot urine sample is preferred over the use of the transtubular po- tassium gradient.2-4 A urinary potassium excre- tion of at least 20 mmol per day (or \u226515 mmol per liter in a spot urine sample) is suggestive of renal potassium wasting. Conversely, an excre- tion of less than 20 mmol per day (or <15 mmol per liter in a spot urine sample) suggests that the hypokalemia is due to nonrenal losses or trans- cellular shifts. It is important to note the limita- tions of tests to quantify urinary potassium. First, the use of diuretic agents confounds the assessment of urinary potassium. Second, renal potassium excretion is dependent on the delivery of sodium to the distal nephron so that sodium can be reabsorbed in exchange for potassium. In patients with impaired delivery of sodium to the distal nephron (e.g., severe intravascular volume depletion), a low urinary sodium level makes the interpretation of the urinary potassium level less useful. Finally, a high volume of urine can result in a low potassium level in a spot urine sample despite renal potassium wasting.5,6 Normalizing the potassium level in a spot urine sample with urine creatinine can help offset the effects of high urine volume. Information that would have quantified urinary potassium excretion was not provided in this case, so I will next consider re- nal potassium loss, nonrenal potassium loss, and intracellular shifts.\nRenal Potassium Loss\nCauses of renal potassium wasting can be fur- ther characterized on the basis of the patient\u2019s blood pressure. The most common cause of re- nal potassium wasting associated with normo- tension or hypotension is the use of diuretics. Vomiting or nasogastric tube output can also cause hypokalemia due to secondary hyperaldo- steronism resulting from volume contraction in addition to the loss of gastric acid in the stom- ach. This process leads to metabolic alkalosis and increased delivery of bicarbonate to the distal nephron, with subsequent renal excretion of bicarbonate and potassium together.\nGenetic conditions such as Gitelman\u2019s syn-\ndrome or Bartter\u2019s syndrome mimic a diuretic effect, and patients generally present with hypo- kalemia in childhood or early adulthood. In the context of normal or low blood pressure, hypo- kalemia can be induced by other forms of either genetic or acquired renal tubular acidosis (i.e., acetazolamide or amphotericin exposure) and hypomagnesemia, which leads to ROMK chan- nel activation and potassium efflux.7 Because this patient was hypertensive, these diagnoses are unlikely.\nRenal potassium wasting in the context of hypertension is generally mediated by the min- eralocorticoid receptor. Both primary aldoste- ronism (characterized by a low-renin, high-aldo- sterone state) and secondary hyperaldosteronism (characterized by a high-renin, high-aldosterone state) can lead to hypertension and renal potas- sium wasting through activation of mineralocor- ticoid receptors by aldosterone. Primary aldoste- ronism can be caused by adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal adenoma, or adrenal carcinoma. Sec- ondary hyperaldosteronism can be caused by renin-secreting tumors or renal artery stenosis. However, neither primary aldosteronism nor sec- ondary hyperaldosteronism would explain this patient\u2019s diarrhea, tremor, and insomnia.\nMineralocorticoid receptors can also be acti-\nvated by cortisol, which has a strong affinity for these receptors but is normally inactivated to cortisone by the hormone 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2). In aldosterone- responsive epithelial cells, inhibition of 11\u03b2-HSD2 leads to high levels of intracellular cortisol (since the enzyme resides in the cell) and activation of mineralocorticoid receptors. Other inhibitors of 11\u03b2-HSD2 include medications (e.g., the tri- azole antifungal medications itraconazole and posaconazole) and certain substances in food (e.g., glycyrrhetinic acid, a component of lico- rice).8 However, this patient was not known to take these medications or to eat such foods. The action of 11\u03b2-HSD2 can be overwhelmed in pa- tients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome or cosyntropin- secreting tumors.8,9 Given this patient\u2019s hyperten- sion and proximal muscle weakness, Cushing\u2019s syndrome would be a more likely explanation if he had an inappropriately elevated urinary po- tassium level; however, the hallmark findings of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, such as facial plethora, supraclavicular fat pads, and abdominal striae, were not present on physical examination.\nIn addition, several genetic disorders are\nassociated with apparent mineralocorticoid excess, including 11\u03b2-HSD2 deficiency, Liddle\u2019s syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism. Al- though this patient was hypertensive, there was no known family history of hypertension, and none of these conditions would explain weight loss, diarrhea, tremor, and insomnia.\n\nNonrenal Potassium Loss\nExcessive heat exposure and exertion can also lead to hypokalemia owing to potassium loss through the skin, although this patient reported neither of these. He reported that he had had diarrhea, which can cause gastrointestinal po- tassium losses as well as non\u2013anion-gap meta- bolic acidosis resulting from the loss of bicar- bonate in the stool. However, the occurrence of diarrhea would not explain tremor or insomnia, so I will consider other causes of hypokalemia.\n\nIntracellular Shift\nPersons with renal and nonrenal losses of potas- sium have a total body deficit of potassium. A fall in the blood level of potassium by approxi- mately 1 mmol per liter can result in a reduction of more than 100 mmol per liter in total body potassium stores. Conversely, patients with hypo- kalemia that is associated with intracellular shift have normal total body potassium levels, and treatment with small amounts of potassium will normalize the blood potassium level. In this\n \npatient, treatment with only 60 meq of potassi- um chloride normalized the blood potassium level, which suggests that his hypokalemia is caused by an intracellular shift of potassium. However, in such cases, the blood potassium level should be monitored in the hours and days after initial normalization in response to potas- sium repletion. If this patient had had low total body potassium stores, the initial rise in the blood potassium level may have been followed by a decrease as the administered potassium redis- tributed into the intracellular pool over time. In addition, transient hyperkalemia will develop during the repletion of potassium in one in six patients with hypokalemia.10\nWhat could drive an intracellular shift of po-\ntassium in this patient? He was not hypother- mic, and he did not use any medications that are associated with intracellular shifts of potassium, such as insulin, theophylline, or \u03b2-adrenergic agents (including decongestants containing pseu- doephedrine or ephedrine). There was nothing in the patient\u2019s history that would suggest refeed- ing syndrome or leukemic crisis, both of which cause intracellular shifts of potassium owing to increased hematopoiesis.11,12 In addition, these causes of intracellular shift of potassium are all associated with mild hypokalemia. Intracellular shifts resulting in a more profound and symp- tomatic hypokalemia, as was seen in this patient, are more likely to be caused by familial hypoka- lemic periodic paralysis or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) (Table 2).13,14\nFamilial hypokalemic periodic paralysis is an\nautosomal dominant, inherited disorder caused by mutations in calcium, sodium, or potassium channels of skeletal muscles. It is most often diagnosed in patients younger than 20 years of age who are of Asian descent and have a family history of the disease. TPP is an acquired disor- der resulting in increased Na+/K+\u2013ATPase sensi- tivity. It occurs mostly in men of Asian descent between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although TPP has also been described in patients of Latin American descent.13,14 In addition, TPP can clas- sically cause associated hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia, but these were not detected in this patient. A recent genomewide association study identified multiple susceptibility loci for TPP in a population of more than 2000 Chinese patients with Graves\u2019 disease (537 of whom had TPP), a finding that suggests that TPP is a molecular subtype of Graves\u2019 disease.15 A loss of func- tion or dominant-negative mutations in the skeletal muscle\u2013specific potassium channel Kir2.6 may contribute to TPP, and a gain-of-function promoter variant in the encoding gene has been described in a patient with normokalemic periodic paraly- sis.16-19 Genomewide association studies have also consistently implicated a variant in KCNJ2, the gene15,20 that encodes a related skeletal muscle potassium channel, Kir2.1, which is as- sociated with a predisposition to TPP. It is im- portant to note that an outward-directed, inward- rectifying potassium current, mediated by Kir channels (primarily Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 tetra- mers), is reduced in the skeletal muscles of pa- tients with TPP.21\nClinical episodes in patients with TPP and\nfamilial hypokalemic periodic paralysis consist of intermittent and often progressive proximal muscle weakness and even paralysis in the con- text of profound hypokalemia. Episodes com- monly occur after high carbohydrate intake (which results in endogenous insulin release, further driving potassium into cells by means of the Na+/K+\u2013ATPase); strenuous exercise (from a re- bound influx of potassium back into cells follow- ing skeletal muscle release during physical activity); or as in this case, on awakening in the morning. Although this patient had a maternal aunt who had had a nonspecific episode of weakness, I would expect a history of more repeated episodes\n \nif there were a true family history of periodic paralysis. In addition, this patient\u2019s age is more consistent with TPP than with familial hypoka- lemic periodic paralysis. It is important to note that his weight loss, tachycardia, hypertension, conjunctival injection, and tremor suggest hyper- thyroidism, which favors a diagnosis of TPP. Moreover, electrocardiographic abnormalities are more commonly found in patients with TPP than in those with familial hypokalemic periodic pa- ralysis, possibly owing to the cardiac effects of thyrotoxicosis. In this case, an electrocardiogram showed no U waves (small deflections that follow the T waves), but there was evidence of right bundle-branch block. Although clinical episodes are similar in patients with familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis and those with TPP, distin- guishing between the two diagnoses is important for treatment and prognosis. TPP can be func- tionally cured with the correction of hyperthy- roidism, whereas familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis often results in progressive muscle weakness despite the avoidance of triggers.\nOther Diagnostic Possibilities\nThe patient had mixed respiratory and non\u2013anion- gap metabolic acidosis, which is not explained by a diagnosis of TPP. His non\u2013anion-gap meta- bolic acidosis is likely related to the diarrhea, which leads to an increased loss of bicarbonate in the gastrointestinal tract. The respiratory acidosis could have been caused by respiratory muscle weakness in the context of hypokalemia. Alter- natively, the sedating effects of substances could have led to respiratory acidosis. This patient was taking an herbal supplement (Nervitran) that contains valerian, passionflower, and hops and is marketed in Latin America as a treatment for stress, anxiety, and insomnia. I could not find any published case reports associating this prod- uct with hypokalemia, but each of these compo- nents are postulated to have sedative effects, possibly through interaction with \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptors.\nSeveral other laboratory abnormalities are left unexplained by TPP, including a mildly elevated aldolase level and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Perhaps these findings are due to a low degree of muscle-cell death or the hepatotoxic effect of either alcohol or supplement intake.\nOverall, this 27-year-old man\u2019s presentation with subacute symptoms that were suggestive of hyperthyroidism and symptomatic hypokalemia, which occurred after physical exertion and re- sponded to modest potassium repletion, is most consistent with a diagnosis of TPP. I would con- firm the diagnosis with tests of thyroid function. Given the association between TPP and Graves\u2019 disease, I would also test for the presence of activating thyrotropin-receptor autoantibodies.\n",
