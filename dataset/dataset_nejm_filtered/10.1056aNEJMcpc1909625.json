    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Pierre O. Ankomah (Medicine): A 34-year-old man with asthma was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of dyspnea.\nThree months before admission, odynophagia developed, and the patient noted white plaques in his mouth. He presented to an urgent care clinic, where a clinical diagnosis of thrush was made, and an oral suspension of nystatin was prescribed. One month before admission, exertional dyspnea and a cough developed. The cough was intermittently productive of thick, grayish sputum that occasionally contained a small amount of blood. The patient used an albuterol metered-dose inhaler, but the dyspnea progressively worsened. Two weeks before admission, fatigue, myalgias, night sweats, shaking chills, and midsternal chest pain devel- oped. During the 3 days before admission, the patient also noted fevers. On the morning of admission, because of the progressive dyspnea and odynophagia, the patient presented to the emergency department at another hospital for evaluation. On examination at the other hospital, the patient was cachectic and appeared ill.\nThe temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the blood pressure\n96/65 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The height was 170 cm, the weight\n49.9 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 17.3. The mucous membranes were dry, and white plaques were noted throughout the mouth and posterior oropharynx. The lungs were clear, with no crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The red-cell indexes and blood levels of glucose, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and lactic acid were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Culture of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza type A and B antigens was negative, and a rapid screening test for hu- man immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies was positive. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Intravenous fluids, acetaminophen, and ketorolac were administered, and imaging studies of the chest were performed.\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: A posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 1A) showed diffuse, hazy air- space opacities that were more prominent on the right side than on the left side, with slight peri- hilar predominance. Subsequent computed to- mography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material (Fig. 1B), revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities bilaterally; there was no evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion.\nDr. Ankomah: Two hours after the patient ar- rived at the emergency department of the other hospital, the oxygen saturation decreased to 91% and the blood pressure decreased to 81/42 mm Hg. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, a central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and a continuous infusion of norepinephrine at a rate of 4 \u03bcg per minute was initiated. The blood pressure increased to 106/64 mm Hg. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient\u2019s blood pressure was normal, and the norepinephrine infusion was stopped; additional history was ob- tained. The patient reported a diffuse headache. During the preceding 2 months, he had lost approximately 13.6 kg of weight and had had nausea, intermittent vomiting, and mild, diffuse abdominal pain. He had a history of depression, anxiety, and asthma. Thirteen years earlier, he had been treated for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Medications included inhaled albuterol, inhaled budesonide\u2013formoterol, and oral alprazolam as needed. He had no known allergies.\nThe patient was of Mediterranean descent, had been born in the southwestern United States, and had traveled to northern Africa in the re- mote past. He had unstable housing and slept in shelters or at the homes of friends and family in coastal New England, where he worked on a seasonal basis. He had smoked approximately 10 cigarettes per day since he was 18 years of age, drank two glasses of wine every evening, and smoked marijuana occasionally; he did not inject illicit drugs. He had had 20 previous sexual partners, both men and women, and had used condoms inconsistently.\nOn   examination,   the   patient appeared chronically ill. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/56  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  20  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Auscultation of the lungs revealed scattered bi- basilar crackles. Examination of the skin revealed diffuse xerosis, scattered hypopigmented macules on the arms, and a violaceous plaque with irregu- lar borders on the plantar aspect of the medial right foot. The remainder of the examination was unchanged. Tests for pneumococcal and legio- nella antigens in the urine were negative, and the blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was greater than 500 pg per milliliter (normal value, <60). A clini- cal diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia was made. Treatment with trimethoprim\u2013sulfa- methoxazole was continued, treatment with cef- triaxone and levofloxacin was discontinued, and treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, f lucona- zole, and prednisone was initiated. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nOn the second hospital day, additional labora-\ntory test results were received. A screening assay for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen was positive, and an antibody differentiation assay confirmed the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. The plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 363,000 copies per milliliter, and the blood CD4+ T-cell count was 77 per cubic millimeter (reference range, 348 to 1456); 11% of the lymphocytes were CD4+ T cells (reference range, 21 to 64). A blood test for Treponema pallidum antibodies was positive, a rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and a T. pallidum particle agglutination assay was positive. A lumbar puncture revealed clear cerebrospinal fluid with no red or white cells and normal levels of protein and glucose; a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test was negative. Three induced spu- tum smears that were examined for acid-fast bacilli were negative, as were a sputum poly- merase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for Mycobacte- rium tuberculosis, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for cell-mediated immune response to M. tuberculosis, and a blood test for cryptococcal antigen. A test for cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies was positive, and the result of a PCR test for cytomegalovirus DNA performed on a blood specimen was unde- tectable.\nThe patient\u2019s dyspnea and cough gradually abated, and treatment with supplemental oxygen, vancomycin, and cefepime was discontinued. On the fourth hospital day, a 2-week course of intra- venous penicillin was initiated.\nOn the fifth hospital day, the patient reported that his abdominal pain had increased. The pain was diffuse, moderate in intensity, and sharp, and it worsened when he was in the supine posi- tion. On examination, the abdomen was soft, with diffuse tenderness on palpation that was most severe in the right and left upper quadrants. Dr. Mendoza: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a moderate fecal load but was otherwise normal.\nDr. Ankomah: Polyethylene glycol and senna were administered. On the sixth hospital day, a fixed-dose formulation of bictegravir, emtricita- bine, and tenofovir alafenamide was started, and the dosage of prednisone was decreased.\nDuring the next 4 days, the abdominal pain worsened and was associated with abdominal distention, nausea, several episodes of blood- tinged emesis, and loose stools. On examination, the abdomen was diffusely tender on palpation; normal bowel sounds were present. Laboratory studies revealed stable liver-function test results and a blood lactic acid level of 4.1 mmol per liter (reference range, 0.5 to 2.0).\nDr. Mendoza: Repeat CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis was normal.\nDr. Ankomah: Intravenous fluids were adminis- tered, and the blood lactic acid level normalized.\n\nTable 1.

These findings are highly suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael Saag: This is a complicated case of a 34-year-old man who presented with signs and symptoms of advanced HIV infection. In other disease conditions, the concept of Occam\u2019s razor applies, whereby one unifying diagnosis explains most, if not all, of the presenting symptoms. However, in patients with advanced HIV infec- tion, Occam\u2019s razor does not apply; rather, ad- vanced HIV infection is more consistent with Hickam\u2019s dictum, which states that a patient may have several diseases that are causing the presenting symptoms. We know that this patient had at least one acquired immunodeficiency syn- drome (AIDS)\u2013defining condition, P. jirovecii pneumonia, and probably had candidal esophagitis on initial presentation, at the urgent care clinic. Both entities were treated appropriately and had presumably resolved. We are left, then, with some epidemiologic hints and a symptom complex of pneumonia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, and skin lesions with which to construct the differ- ential diagnosis.\n\nEpidemiologic Considerations\nTravel to Northern Africa\nSeveral clues regarding potential causes of this patient\u2019s residual symptoms can be gleaned from his travel history. The patient had traveled to northern Africa, where leishmaniasis is a com- mon infectious complication of HIV infection. The organism that causes this infection (Leish- mania donovani) is transmitted by the sand flea; in HIV-infected patients, this infection often manifests as kala-azar, a severe infection that is characterized by fever, anemia, abdominal pain, and weight loss. A common condition associated with leishmaniasis is splenomegaly, which this patient did not have. Therefore, leishmaniasis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\n\nBirthplace in the Southwestern United States\nThis patient was born in the southwestern United States, which raises the possibility of coccidioi- domycosis. Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, the causative organisms of coccidioidomycosis, are dimorphic fungi that reside in the soil. In the desert, these organisms undergo robust growth during the rainy season and then become dor- mant during the long, dry spells, when frag- ments of the mold break off into arthroconidia (asexual spores) that are inhaled by the host. The initial infection typically manifests as pneumo- nia, which is clinically indistinguishable from\nP. jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infec-\ntion. The chest radiographs of patients with\nP. jirovecii pneumonia are similar in appearance to those of patients with coccidioidomycosis, in- cluding the presence of thin-walled cavities, and both types of pneumonia are associated with high blood levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, which this patient had. The infection can spread to other sites in the body, most notably the skin, bones, and central nervous system. The disease may reactivate at a time when the immune system is weakened (e.g., in patients with HIV infection),\n \n\nwhich can result in the manifestation of symp- toms years after the initial infection.1 However, most cases of coccidioidomycosis in patients with HIV infection are the result of primary in- fection that becomes chronic. Reactivation of the disease is quite rare, and the absence of bone disease, meningitis, and skin lesions typically associated with coccidioidomycosis makes this diagnosis unlikely in this patient.\n\nUnstable Housing\nAnother epidemiologic factor to consider is that the patient had unstable housing. Both murine typhus (also known as endemic typhus) and epi- demic typhus have been reported among home- less persons with HIV infection. Epidemic typhus, which is caused by Rickettsia prowazekii (transmit- ted by body lice), is characterized by fever, head- ache, pneumonitis, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and rash. Murine typhus, which is caused by\nR. typhi or R. felis (transmitted by fleas), manifests with fever, chills, headache, and rash. However, in both conditions, the rash is typically a nodular or papular diffuse skin eruption, which is quite different from the localized violaceous plaque seen on this patient\u2019s right foot.\n\nPneumonia, Abdominal Pain, and Hematemesis\nTuberculosis\nIn addition to P. jirovecii pneumonia, many patho- gens can cause pneumonitis in patients with advanced HIV infection and can disseminate to other anatomical sites. M. tuberculosis is the most common such pathogen worldwide, and tubercu- losis is the most common opportunistic infection in sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple tests for tuber- culosis, including an interferon-\u03b3 release assay, were negative in this case, making tuberculosis an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nHistoplasmosis\nThe manifestation of histoplasmosis is similar to that of tuberculosis. Any time a diagnosis of tuberculosis is considered in a patient with HIV infection, histoplasmosis should be strongly con- sidered. Histoplasmosis is caused by the dimor- phic fungus Histoplasma capsulatum and is character- ized by fever and pneumonitis that is clinically indistinguishable from P. jirovecii pneumonia and tuberculosis. In HIV-infected patients, the organ- ism often disseminates to the liver, spleen, adrenal gland, gut, oropharynx, central nervous system, and skin. The skin lesions are papulopustular, and the organism can often be identified on exami- nation of a skin-biopsy specimen. Fluconazole, one of the antifungal agents that this patient received for the treatment of thrush, has subop- timal activity against H. capsulatum. In this case, although histoplasmosis is certainly a possible diagnosis, the skin lesions observed in this pa- tient were not consistent with those associated with histoplasmosis, and persons with dissemi- nated histoplasmosis typically have unrelenting, high fever (often with a temperature >40\u00b0C), which was not the case in this patient.\n\nM. avium Complex and Cytomegalovirus Disseminated M. avium complex infection and dis- seminated cytomegalovirus infection are com- mon in patients with advanced HIV infection (defined by a CD4 T-cell count of <50 per cubic millimeter) and typically result in end-organ dis- ease. Each disease can cause fever and dissemi- nated gastrointestinal involvement and can invade the adrenal glands, leading to adrenal insuffi- ciency, which could explain this patient\u2019s epi- sodic hypotension. M. avium complex infection often involves the intestinal mucosa and results in severe diarrhea. On rare occasions, it can cause intussusception around a nodular M. avium com- plex lesion, which results in severe abdominal pain and a potential ruptured viscus. Cytomega- lovirus infection in the gut often involves the esophagus, leading to ulcerations that result in dysphagia. Less commonly, cytomegalovirus can invade the cecum, resulting in clinically signifi- cant abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, usually without diarrhea. The absence of abnor- malities on this patient\u2019s imaging studies, partic- ularly the absence of visceral lymphadenopathy and colonic thickening, along with a relatively high CD4 T-cell count (>50 per cubic millimeter), make these two diagnoses unlikely.\n\nCryptosporidiosis\nCryptosporidium parvum is an opportunistic patho- gen that typically causes profuse watery diarrhea and is present in up to 20% of patients with advanced, untreated HIV infection in the United States. C. parvum can invade the biliary tract, causing obstruction of the bile duct, colicky ab- dominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, with or with-\n \nout diarrhea; some of these symptoms were seen in this patient. On rare occasions, cryptosporidial pneumonitis is observed.2 However, cryptosporidial biliary disease invariably is manifested by elevat- ed alkaline phosphatase levels and biliary ductal dilatation; neither of these findings was observed in this patient.\n\nAspergillosis\nDisseminated aspergillosis is a relatively uncom- mon, but often fatal, opportunistic fungal infec- tion in patients with advanced, untreated HIV infection. It occurs most commonly in patients who have had bouts of recurrent neutropenia. The hallmark of aspergillus disease is the inva- sion of blood vessels by the mold, which results in arterial obstruction and subsequent infarction and necrosis of organ tissues; the brain, lung, gut, skin, liver, and spleen are common sites of in- fection. Because the organism often invades gut tissue, bowel infarction with resultant abdomi- nal pain and bleeding are common presenting symptoms. The elevated lactic acid level noted in this patient is consistent with bowel ischemia. However, CT angiography of the abdomen was normal, and when considered in combination with the absence of neutropenia, this condition is essentially ruled out in this case.\n\nViolaceous Plaque with Irregular Borders The presence of a purple skin lesion with irregu- lar borders on the plantar aspect of the medial right foot suggests two probable diagnoses: bacil- lary angiomatosis and Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Bacillary angiomatosis is a condition characterized by skin lesions resulting from disseminated bartonella infection from either Bartonella henselae or B. quin-\ntana. The skin lesions, which appear as numerous pinpoint purplish-to-bright red raised spots or nodules, are often indistinguishable from those associated with Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. The organism causes blood vessels to proliferate uncontrolla- bly, which leads to the formation of tumorlike masses in the bone, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, and gastrointestinal tract.3 Gut lesions can bleed spontaneously, resulting in hematemesis or hema- tochezia. However, the most common organ system (other than skin) that is affected by bar- tonella species is the liver. Peliosis hepatis is characterized by multiple, randomly distributed, blood-filled lesions throughout the liver that range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. A biopsy of suspected peliosis hepatis lesions should be performed with caution, owing to the risk of massive, occasion- ally fatal, bleeding.\nKaposi\u2019s sarcoma was originally described by Moritz Kaposi in Vienna in 1872 in five elderly men of Mediterranean descent who had \u201cidio- pathic multiple pigmented sarcoma.\u201d In 1981, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma was one of the original AIDS- defining conditions among gay men in New York City.4 Among patients with HIV infection, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is characterized by painless violaceous macules or nodules on the feet, legs, trunk, or face. The disease, which is caused by human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma\u2013associated herpesvirus), is known to be transmitted sexually but also is believed to be transmitted from mother to child and potentially among siblings through excretion in saliva. As the disease advances, it can spread to regional lymph nodes, sometimes resulting in profound lymphedema of dependent areas, or it can progress to disseminated involvement of the oropharynx, lungs, gut, genitals, or visceral organs. Pul- monary involvement may result in hemoptysis, and gastrointestinal involvement may result in gastrointestinal bleeding or hematemesis.\nHow can we distinguish between these two entities? First, disseminated bartonella infection is usually accompanied by high fever, which is absent in this patient. Second, the absence of liver lesions on CT reduces the likelihood of bar- tonella infection, since liver lesions are more common than gut lesions in disseminated infec- tion. Finally, bartonella skin lesions are rarely present on the palms, on the soles, or in the mouth. This patient\u2019s skin lesion was on the plan- tar aspect of the right foot.\nIn contrast, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is commonly manifested by lesions, often solitary, on the soles of the feet. There is typically no fever, the skin lesions usually have irregular borders, and silent lesions can be present in the gut or lungs, even when no skin lesions are present. Visceral in- volvement is often accompanied by Kaposi\u2019s sar- coma lesions in the mouth, usually on the hard or soft palate, gums, or buccal mucosa. These lesions are often subtle and may not be easily identified on physical examination. For reasons that remain unclear, the use of glucocorticoids tends to accelerate the progression of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions, even when used as treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma\u2013immune reconstitution in- f lammatory syndrome after initiation of anti- retroviral therapy.5 This patient received appro- priate treatment with glucocorticoids for the prevention of respiratory progression and deoxy- genation during the first several days of anti- pneumocystis therapy,6 which could have inad- vertently worsened any Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions that may have been present in his gastrointesti- nal tract. I suspect that the diagnostic procedure was an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that showed Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma lesions in the gut, some of which may have been bleeding.\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Marc S. Sherman: Upper endoscopy revealed a normal-appearing esophagus. However, in the stomach (Fig. 2A), approximately 15 firm, hyper- emic nodules were observed that were evenly distributed from below the gastroesophageal junction to the antrum. On gross examination, the gastric mucosa appeared otherwise normal. The first and second part of the duodenum showed normal villi and mucosa. In the early third part of the duodenum (Fig. 2B), there were additional lesions that had the same hyperemic appearance but were more architecturally f lat than protruding. Biopsies of the gastric and duo- denal lesions were performed. The endoscopic appearance of these lesions was strongly sugges- tive of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma.\nDr. Angela Shih: On histologic examination, the biopsy specimen obtained from a stomach nod- ule was remarkable for a bland spindle-cell pro- liferation in the lamina propria, with extravasated erythrocytes and occasional hyaline globules (Fig. 2C). The biopsy specimen obtained from a duodenal lesion showed a similarly expansile spindle-cell proliferation in the lamina propria, with numerous extravasated erythrocytes (Fig. 2D). No mitotic figures or areas of necrosis were identified. Immunohistochemical staining for ERG (a highly specific marker of endothelial cells) showed strong nuclear staining in the spindle cells, consistent with endothelial differentiation (Fig. 2E). A stain for HHV-8 was also strongly positive in these cells (Fig. 2F). These findings supported a diagnosis of multifocal Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma with involvement of the stomach and duodenum. At the time of admission, the patient also had a painful lesion on the instep of his right foot (Fig. 3A), which, on further examination, was found to be a violaceous plaque with irregular borders. A biopsy specimen of the lesion at low magnification showed largely intact acral skin with scattered dilated vascular spaces in the su- perficial and deep dermis (Fig. 3B); at higher magnification, the vascular spaces were found to be closely associated with normal adnexal structures and were lined by hyperchromatic hobnailed endothelial cells (Fig. 3C). Immuno- histochemical staining for HHV-8 revealed that the atypical endothelial cells were strongly posi- tive (Fig. 3D), which was diagnostic for cutane- ous Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma.\n \nFigure 2. Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and Biopsy Specimens of the Stomach and Duodenum.\nAn image of the stomach obtained during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows hyperemic nodules throughout the stomach (Panel A, arrows; the inset and the yellow triangle within the inset show the field of view of the image). Similar lesions, although flatter, are also present in the third part of the duodenum (Panel B, arrows; the inset and the yellow triangle within the inset show the field of view of the image). On hematoxylin and eosin staining, a biopsy specimen of a stomach nodule (Panel C) shows a bland spindle\u2011cell proliferation in the lamina propria, with numerous extravasated red cells and occasional hyaline globules (arrow). A biopsy specimen of a duodenal lesion (Panel D) shows a similar spindle\u2011cell proliferation, expanding the lamina propria with extravasated erythrocytes. Immunohis\u2011 tochemical staining reveals that the spindle cells are positive for ERG (a highly specific marker of endothelial cells) (Panel E) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV\u20118) (Panel F).\n\nFigure 3.
