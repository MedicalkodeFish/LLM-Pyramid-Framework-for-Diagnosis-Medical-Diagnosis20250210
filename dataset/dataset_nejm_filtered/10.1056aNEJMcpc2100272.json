    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David P. Bullis (Behavioral Medicine, Newton\u2013Wellesley Hospital, Newton, MA): A 54-year-old man was evaluated by the neuropsychology service of this hospital because of irritability, confusion, and odd behaviors.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before the current evaluation, when he received a diagnosis of squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue that had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. He underwent sur- gical dissection of the neck and resection of the tongue base on the right side, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, which resulted in cancer remission. After treatment, neck pain and shoulder weakness developed and was attributed to postoperative neuropathy involving the right spinal accessory nerve.\nIn the context of this illness and persistent pain, the patient sought care at the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic of this hospital and received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety. During the next 8 months, the patient was seen for psychotherapy approximately every 2 weeks. Treatment for the pain included physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, acupunc- ture, trigger-point injections, and the use of a scapular elevation brace. Therapy with oxycodone, methadone, gabapentin, tizanidine, and duloxetine was started. Four months before the current evaluation, a sural nerve graft was placed in the right spinal accessory nerve from the proximal, functioning portion to the distal portion, but the pain and weakness did not abate.\nSix weeks before the current evaluation, the patient did not respond to tele- phone calls for 24 hours. The police were called and found the patient unrespon- sive with prescription medication bottles nearby. Emergency medical services personnel arrived, and the initial evaluation, in the patient\u2019s home, was notable for a severely decreased respiratory rate. Naloxone was administered, the trachea was intubated, and the patient was taken to a local hospital. In the emergency department, the patient was pulseless with ongoing electrocardiographic activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and epinephrine was administered; after 4 minutes, spontaneous circulation was restored. The dose of methadone was decreased, and therapy with oxycodone, gaba- pentin, and tizanidine was stopped. During the subsequent 6 days, septic shock, aspiration pneu- monia, acute kidney injury, and delirium oc- curred. When these problems resolved, the pa- tient was discharged home.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the patient participated in a video follow-up evalua- tion at the behavioral medicine clinic. He ex- pressed embarrassment and frustration related to his apparent accidental overdose. He described persistent depression, increased anxiety, and no other new symptoms.\nTwo weeks before the current evaluation, the patient missed a routine video follow-up evalua- tion at the behavioral medicine clinic, and his family was called. For the preceding 2 weeks, they had noticed that the patient was uncharac- teristically agitated, irritable, talking loudly, and verbally abusive. Odd behaviors were reported. The patient had gotten lost while driving to a friend\u2019s house that he visited frequently, had been pulled over by police for driving erratically (with normal results on a breathalyzer test), and on another occasion, had been found walking along the highway under an overpass. He called family members repeatedly in the middle of the night, and he would not answer when the calls were returned. When the family requested a police wellness check of the patient, the patient retali- ated by requesting a police wellness check of the family members. After this incident, the family was advised to take the patient to a local hospi- tal for admission.\nAt the local hospital, the patient reported no symptoms and noted that he had stopped taking methadone because he was concerned about a medication overdose. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 19, indicating cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive func- tion.1 Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, revealed a nonspecific hypodensity in the centrum semiovale on the left side. The patient was told he had mild dementia. Visiting nurse services were arranged, and the patient was discharged home.\nOne week before the current evaluation, the\npatient\u2019s family reported that he had increased confusion and odd behaviors. He was unable to recall details of conversations that had happened minutes before. He could not operate the tele- phone or remote control and had emptied the trash can into the toilet. He had asked for his clothes to be cut off because he felt uncomfortable. Family members had been staying with the patient every night since his recent discharge because they were concerned about his safety. A neuropsychological evaluation was requested.\nDr. Michael W. Parsons: The evaluation was con- ducted by the cancer center neuropsychology service of this hospital with the use of videocon- ferencing technology to reduce the risk of expo- sure to coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient acknowledged only minimal cognitive changes and was dismissive of the family\u2019s con- cerns. A review of systems was notable for fa- tigue, moderate depression, mild anxiety, and difficulty sleeping and keeping track of time.\nAdditional history obtained from the patient\u2019s family included insomnia, lumbar disk hernia- tion, olecranon bursitis, and an inguinal hernia that had led to surgical repair in early adulthood. He had had multiple concussions as a teenager, as well as a brief loss of consciousness during a motor vehicle collision 3 years earlier. After the collision, fatigue, headaches, difficulty concen- trating, and impaired memory occurred; during the subsequent 2 years, occupational therapy was provided, and the symptoms gradually resolved. Medications at the time of evaluation includ-  ed ibuprofen, acetaminophen, duloxetine, trazo- done, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and multi- vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England with family members nearby. He had completed a master\u2019s degree and had had a successful career; he had taken a leave of ab- sence from work 9 months earlier in anticipation of cancer treatment. After cancer treatment, he had been unable to return to work because of pain. He was athletic, walked 3 miles daily, and enjoyed golfing. He rarely drank alcohol and had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs. His family history included breast cancer and de- mentia in his mother, hearing loss and hypertension in his father, metastatic cancer with an unknown primary source in his paternal grand- father, glaucoma and alcohol use disorder in his maternal grandmother, and a brain tumor in a more distant relative.\nOn video neuropsychological examination, the patient was in no distress and was adequately groomed, with normal-appearing hygiene. His affect was irritable, and the fact that he reported no symptoms suggested limited insight. His spontaneous speech was fluent and well articu- lated. His thoughts were tangential, and he was frequently forgetful and easily distracted; his information processing speed was slow. A for- mal neuropsychological assessment revealed im- paired executive functioning, marked by disin- hibition and poor working memory, as well as deficits in recent memory, verbal f luency, and information processing speed.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Nicholas Kontos: Nine months before the cur- rent presentation, this 54-year-old man had re- ceived a diagnosis of metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the tongue, for which he had un- dergone neck dissection and tongue-base resec- tion on the right side, as well as local radiation therapy. He was followed in the cancer center behavioral medicine clinic for an adjustment dis- order with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. Approximately 1 month after he had an overdose and associated cardiac arrest, worsening psychi- atric symptoms developed. To determine the cause of a complex neuropsychiatric illness, it is important to review the psychiatric symptoms with the use of a longitudinal approach.2 In this case, we will consider the current presentation; the baseline events, which occurred from 9 months before the current presentation up to the over dose; the events that occurred from the time of the overdose up to the current presentation; and then any relevant events in the distant medical history. \nCurrent Presentation\nThis patient\u2019s current problems fall into behav- ioral and cognitive domains. His behavioral im- pairments include irritability and disinhibited ex- pressions of anger, as well as behaviors described as generally odd. His cognitive impairments in- clude amnesia, agnosia, apraxia, dysphasia, inat- tention, and executive dysfunction. It is possible that all these cognitive deficits developed in a matter of weeks, but an emphasis on looking beyond what the errors are to how they are made can reveal an impostor deficit (e.g., with the cog- nitive deficits reflecting a sequencing problem rather than a memory or visuospatial one) or an overarching deficit that affects other cognitive functions.4\nCognition and behavior have been conceptual-\nized as reflecting state-dependent and channel- dependent functions.5 State-dependent functions include arousal, attention, and motivation. Im- pairment in any of these areas can distort the expression of the more discrete channel-depen- dent functions, such as language, object identi- fication, praxis, and memory. Although executive functions \u2014 including problem-solving, response selection, sequencing, and planning \u2014 are clas- sified as channel-dependent, there are many ways in which their intactness, or lack thereof, can be expressed.\nAt the time of the current presentation, the\npatient\u2019s condition seems to involve disinhibited emotional expression, impaired attention, and per- haps executive dysfunction. Neuropsychological testing is performed to confirm this impression.\n\nBaseline\nThe available details regarding this patient\u2019s baseline state, before cognitive and behavioral distortion, start with his cancer diagnosis and treatment, 9 months before the current presen- tation. Thereafter, chronic pain developed and he received a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. This disorder would not explain or presage his cur- rent presentation. However, the duration and seemingly worsening nature of his psychological state could suggest major depressive disorder.\nMajor depressive disorder is a tempting unify- ing diagnosis in this case because it can include so-called depressive pseudodementia, which could explain the patient\u2019s cognitive deficits, as well as the phenomenon of anger attacks and irrita- bility.6 The patient\u2019s full array of symptoms is not evident at this stage, so I will return to this diagnostic possibility later. Furthermore, depres- sive pseudodementia remains a poorly defined and contested entity.7\nAnother consideration at this stage is radia- tion-induced encephalopathy. The neuropsychiat- ric manifestations of this condition vary, depend- ing on the target, dose, duration, and timing of radiation therapy. Radiation-induced encephalop- athy can be acute, occurring within 2 weeks after treatment; early delayed, occurring 1 to 6 months after treatment; and late delayed, occurring more than 6 months after treatment.8 Early-delayed radiation-induced encephalopathy could be a possibility in this patient. However, his radiation therapy was localized to the neck and did not in- volve the brain, so the diagnosis of early-delayed radiation-induced encephalopathy is unlikely.\nDelirium and intoxication should be consid-\nered in this patient because he had pain for which he received therapy with oxycodone, methadone, tizanidine, and gabapentin. However, delirium is classically associated with fluctuating distur- bances of arousal and attention, which were absent in this case.\n\nOverdose to Current Presentation\nSix weeks before the current presentation, the patient had cardiac arrest after an overdose. Was the overdose accidental or intentional? Could his dysphoria have progressed to major depressive disorder with associated suicidality? The patient\u2019s embarrassment about the overdose and his safety at home afterward suggest that the overdose was not a suicide attempt. Other features of major depressive disorder that could also contribute to an overdose include poor concentration (which could lead to inadvertent repeated dosing), nega- tivistic thinking (with a belief that the pre- scribed regimen will not work, so more of the drug should be taken), and somatic preoccupa- tion (with an amplified pain sensation and re- sponse). Evidence to confirm these possibilities is lacking.\nFurthermore, there is no evidence of major\ncognitive impairment after the overdose that would suggest delirium. In fact, the patient re- covered from a complicated postoverdose course rather quickly, on the basis of the length of the hospital stay, so delirium is an unlikely explana- tion for his ultimate presentation.\nThis patient had several minutes of pulseless electrical activity. Could he have had an acute hypoperfusion injury to the brain? Such an in- jury can result in watershed, hippocampal, or subcortical infarction. The immediate and early postoverdose course and the results of CT of the head (obtained later) are not consistent with this diagnosis.\nCognitive and behavioral impairments be- came evident approximately 4 weeks after the overdose (2 weeks before the current presenta- tion). The patient received a diagnosis of mild dementia at a local hospital. Frontotemporal de- mentia or the frontal variant of Alzheimer\u2019s disease could develop at this age, as could vas- cular dementia in a patient with severe vascu- lopathy. The nature of his symptoms is charac- teristic of these entities, but the acute onset is not. There is no evidence of a more rapid-onset dementia, such as Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease.\nThe patient has a family history of a brain\ntumor. Although CT of the head would not be the imaging study of choice in the evaluation for a brain tumor, the results of this study were unremarkable. Metastasis to the brain can occur with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck in very rare cases, but concomitant distant metastases in other anatomical locations would be expected.9,10 Paraneoplastic encephalitis should be considered when there are mysterious neuro- psychiatric manifestations, but it would be un- characteristic of squamous-cell carcinoma.11 If further workup proves unhelpful or if neuro- logic signs such as seizures develop, paraneo- plastic encephalitis should be reconsidered.\nDistant Medical History and Summary Although this patient has a history of multiple head injuries, these injuries occurred in the re- mote past, and no persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms or signs have been reported. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy would not explain the current presentation.\nNeuropsychological testing indicated that at- tention and executive function were markedly impaired. As noted, these deficits can produce the cognitive phenotype seen in this patient. Together with disinhibition, these signs can arise from lesions involving the prefrontal circuits of the brain, particularly the subcortical com- ponents: the white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus.\nThis patient presented with a syndrome of inattention, executive dysfunction, and disinhibi- tion that arose over a period of 4 weeks, starting 2 to 4 weeks after a brain hypoperfusion event. This scenario is most consistent with a diagno- sis of delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy. This condition most commonly manifests as be- havior change, inattention, and executive dysfunc- tion, often with parkinsonism and catatonia- spectrum signs. Symmetric bilateral diffuse subcortical demyelination occurs 1 to 4 weeks after oxygen deprivation in the brain, possibly re- sulting from hypoxia-induced interruption of my- elin turnover.12 To establish the diagnosis of de- layed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy, I would recommend performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with attention to the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.\n",
