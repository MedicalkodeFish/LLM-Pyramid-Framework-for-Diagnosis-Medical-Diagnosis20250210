    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Esra D. Gumuser (Medicine): A 48-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of multiple lung and liver  lesions  identified  during  an  evaluation  for  abdomi- nal pain.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 10 days before this ad- mission, when burning epigastric pain developed after she ate a meal. Nausea and vomiting occurred 1 hour later; there was no diarrhea. After the pain persisted for 8 hours, she presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 136/94 mm Hg, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was\n25.8. The abdomen was soft but distended; there was diffuse mild tenderness on palpation, without rebound or guarding. The white-cell count was 12,800 per micro- liter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000) and the blood lipase level 147 U per liter (refer- ence range, 13 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The pain did not resolve after treatment with intravenous famotidine and oral simethicone. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Melissa C. Price: A chest radiograph showed faint nodular opacities in the\nlungs, predominantly in the upper lobes. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdo- men, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple fluid-filled small-bowel loops with associated mild mesenteric edema and trace ascites. There was no biliary dilatation. In addition, there were numerous hypoattenuating hepatic lesions with peripheral enhancement.\nDr. Gumuser: The patient was admitted to the other hospital with a diagnosis of\npossible small-bowel obstruction and pneumonia. Treatment with intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone, oral doxycycline, and bowel rest was initiated. On the second hos- pital day, additional imaging studies of the liver were obtained.\nDr. Price: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Fig. 1), performed\nwith and without the administration of intravenous contrast material,  revealed bilobar hepatic lesions with peripheral enhance- ment, high T2 signal, and diffusion restriction. Dr. Gumuser: Blood was obtained for microbio- logic culture, and treatment with intravenous metronidazole was initiated. On the third hospi- tal day, the abdominal pain had resolved, and the patient began drinking clear fluids. On the fourth hospital day, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was performed. While the results of the liver biopsy were pending, the patient resumed a normal diet, with no recurrence of abdominal pain. Treatment with oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriax-\none and metronidazole was continued.\nDr. Price: On the sixth hospital day, CT of the chest (Fig. 1), performed without the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material, revealed numerous irregular cysts and cavitary nodules in the lungs, which were most pronounced in the upper lobes, as well as solid and subsolid paren- chymal nodules that measured less than 1.0 cm in diameter. There were multiple nodules in the\n \nthyroid gland, measuring up to 2.8 cm in diam- eter in the inferior left thyroid lobe. There was a 1.7-cm nodule with soft-tissue attenuation in the right breast.\nDr. Gumuser: On the eighth hospital day, bron-\nchoscopy was performed. The airways were in- spected to the segmental level, and no abnor- malities were visualized. Transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in the right upper lobe. Examination of the BAL fluid revealed 321 white cells per microliter (ref- erence range, 94 to 175). Gram\u2019s staining and examination of an acid-fast bacilli smear of the BAL fluid were negative.\nOn the ninth hospital day, results of the liver biopsy became available, showing extensive eo- sinophilic infiltration of the liver parenchyma with associated moderate steatosis. Staining of the biopsy specimen for microorganisms, includ- ing mycobacteria, was negative. Cultures of blood obtained on the second hospital day showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hos- pital for further care.\nOn arrival, the patient reported a mild sore throat that had developed after bronchoscopy, but there was no abdominal pain. She had lost 2 kg of weight before the hospitalization, in the con- text of dietary changes. She had no history of fever but reported a several-year history of mild shortness of breath with walking that she at- tributed to smoking. Her surgical history includ- ed cholecystectomy and cesarean section. Results of a Papanicolaou test performed 3 months be- fore this presentation had been normal; the pa- tient had not undergone mammography or colo- noscopy. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in an urban area of New England. She was born in Portugal and had im- migrated to the United States 40 years earlier. She had not traveled recently; her last trip had been to Portugal 25 years before this admission. The patient was divorced, lived alone, and worked in a medical laboratory. She had no known exposure to chemicals or dust; a coworker at a previous office job had had an atypical infection attrib- uted to mold in the workplace. She had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years. She drank alcohol three times a week and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had died from colon cancer at 43 years of age.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/64 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The physi- cal examination was normal.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Krishna P. Reddy: This 48-year-old woman, who smoked tobacco but was otherwise healthy, pre- sented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomit- ing, which resolved during the hospitalization. Imaging studies showed liver lesions, lung pa- renchymal disease, and breast and thyroid nod- ules. Biopsy of a liver lesion revealed an eosino- phil-predominant inflammatory infiltrate. Breast and thyroid nodules are often found incidentally, and it is unclear in this patient whether they are related to the liver and lung lesions. Multiple liver lesions and cystic lung lesions are less common than breast and thyroid nodules and are likely to reflect a single underlying process. Therefore, al- though her only respiratory symptom was chronic mild dyspnea with exertion and she did not have hypoxemia at rest, I will begin by considering the differential diagnosis for diffuse cystic lung disease.\n\nDiffuse Cystic Lung Disease\nLung cysts are walled spherical parenchymal le- sions that have a well-defined interface with nor- mal lung.1 The pathogenesis of lung cyst formation is not well understood but may involve ischemia, airway obstruction with distal hyperinflation, or remodeling induced by matrix-degrading en- zymes.2 High-resolution CT imaging illuminates the distribution and characteristics of the cysts and any other thoracic abnormalities, which can point toward a diagnosis. Collaborative review of the clinical history and images by the treating clinician and the radiologist can be very helpful. In this case, the cysts were innumerable, irregu- larly shaped, heterogeneous in size, of variable wall thickness, and located predominantly in the upper lobes. There were nodules, some of which were cavitary. There was no substantial emphy- sema, bronchiectasis, honeycombing, ground- glass opacification, pleural disease, or lymphade- nopathy. Assessing the chronicity of the disease process can be helpful, but no previous imaging studies were available in this case. The differen- tial diagnosis of cystic lung disease includes typical manifestations of very rare diseases and atypical manifestations of more common dis- eases. To further narrow the differential diagno- sis, I will also consider this patient\u2019s concurrent liver lesions, tobacco smoking, possible environ- mental exposures, and family history.\n\nInfections\nInfections occasionally produce lung cysts. Pneu- mocystis jirovecii pneumonia can cause cysts, often with upper-lobe predominance. This patient was not known to be at high risk for human immu- nodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or to have an- other immunocompromising condition that would confer a predisposition to P. jirovecii pneumonia. Moreover, the absence of substantial respiratory symptoms makes this diagnosis unlikely.\nInfection with coccidioides, a dimorphic fun- gus that is endemic in the southwestern United States, may result in cystic lung disease. However, this patient had no known history of travel to this region.\nIn a patient with concomitant pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, tuberculosis should be considered. This patient was born in Portugal in the 1970s but had not traveled outside the United States recently. The incidence of tuberculosis in Portugal in the early 1970s was approximately 100 cases per 100,000 population.3 If she had been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in her childhood, reactivation of latent infection could have occurred later. In addition, tobacco smoking increases the risk of tuberculosis.4 However, tu- berculosis is rarely associated with cystic lung disease,5 and none of the typical symptoms of tuberculosis were present in this patient, nor were necrotizing granulomas, a finding associ- ated with mycobacterial infection, present in the liver-biopsy specimen.\n \nSome parasitic infections produce lung and liver cysts.6 Hydatid cysts, which are caused by echinococcus, are often filled with fluid. The lung cysts that are caused by paragonimiasis typically develop within areas of consolidation. This pa- tient had not traveled to regions where these para- sites are endemic.\nA disseminated bacterial, fungal, or nontuber- culous mycobacterial infection could cause lung and liver lesions. However, cystic lung disease would be unusual for any of these infections, ex- cept for infection with coccidioides. Furthermore, this patient\u2019s modest symptoms and the absence of known immunocompromise make these di- agnoses unlikely.\n\nNoninfectious Inflammatory  Diseases Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory dis- ease that can affect almost any organ. Pulmonary involvement, which is present in 90% of cases, is typically characterized by hilar lymphadenopathy or interstitial opacities, often with upper-lobe predominance.7 Lung cysts have been reported in patients with sarcoidosis, but they are uncom- mon and typically found in the context of severe\narchitectural distortion of the lung.8 In this pa- tient, the absence of lymphadenopathy, intersti- tial opacities, and lung architectural distortion makes the diagnosis of sarcoidosis unlikely.\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immuno- logic reaction to an inhaled organic antigen, often predominantly affecting the upper lobes. Hypersensitivity conditions should be considered in this patient, given that a coworker reportedly had had an atypical infection attributed to mold in the workplace. However, the coworker\u2019s expo- sure was not at the patient\u2019s current workplace. In patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cystic lesions are identified occasionally, but they usually are not numerous and are associated with nodules and ground-glass opacities.9 In this pa- tient, the large number of cysts, the absence of ground-glass opacities and fibrosis, and the presence of liver lesions are not  consistent with a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n\nGenetic Disorders\nThe Birt\u2013Hogg\u2013Dub\u00e9 syndrome is a rare autoso- mal dominant condition that is characterized by lung cysts, skin hamartomas, and kidney neo- plasms. The lung cysts typically have thin walls and are located at the lung bases and in the subpleural and paramediastinal regions, unlike the cysts observed on this patient\u2019s imaging studies.10 Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects the lungs and liver. Tobacco smoking can accelerate the lung disease. However, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency is characterized by lung emphysema rather than cysts, and it causes chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis rather than\ndiscrete lesions.\n\nCancer and Hyperproliferative  Diseases Cancer is a possible diagnosis in this patient, given her tobacco use, the history of early colon cancer in her mother, and the presence of lesions in multiple organs. Lung cysts can result from primary lung cancer, lymphoma, or metastases from another site, including adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and sarcomas.11-14 However, several features of this\npatient\u2019s presentation are not consistent with a diagnosis of cancer. She did not have substantial constitutional symptoms. The lung disease was diffuse but had upper-lobe predominance with sparing of the lung bases and costophrenic sulci, and there was no lymphadenopathy; these lung features and the absence of lymphadenopathy would be unusual for metastases. Furthermore, no cancer cells were identified in the liver-biopsy specimen.\nAmyloidosis, a process that is sometimes as- sociated with cancer, can involve multiple organs and can cause cystic lung disease in rare cases.15 The lung cysts are typically subpleural or peri- bronchovascular, unlike the cysts described in this patient. The patient is younger than a typical patient with amyloidosis; the diagnosis is most often made in persons older than 60 years of age. In addition, her liver-biopsy specimen did not show evidence of amyloid.\nHypereosinophilic syndromes are marked by eosinophilic infiltration of one or more organs. The detection of an eosinophil-predominant in- filtrate on liver biopsy suggests the possibility of these syndromes. Chronic eosinophilic pneumo- nia may predominantly affect the upper lung zones, but cystic lung disease is not typical. More common pulmonary manifestations of hypereo- sinophilic syndromes include parenchymal opac- ities, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy; none of these findings were observed on this patient\u2019s CT studies. Moreover, this patient did not have peripheral-blood eosinophilia or typical symp- toms associated with hypereosinophilic syndromes, such as atopy, wheeze, or worsening dyspnea.\nThe remaining diagnoses to consider are dis- orders that, like the Birt\u2013Hogg\u2013Dub\u00e9 syndrome, are rare but classically cause cystic lung disease. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is caused by abnormal growth of smooth-muscle cells, which infiltrate the lung interstitium and lead to cyst formation.16 Infiltration can also occur in the lym- phatics, kidneys, and liver. The sporadic form of LAM occurs almost exclusively in women. The round cysts that are characteristic of LAM are relatively homogeneous and usually distributed evenly throughout the lungs, unlike the pattern observed in this patient.\nLymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is char- acterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the lung interstitium and airspaces. It is sometimes as- sociated with rheumatic disease or conditions that cause immunodeficiency, such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome or HIV infection. Lung cysts are com- mon in patients with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, but they typically are not numerous, have thin walls, and are associated with ground- glass opacities, unlike the cysts observed in this patient.17\nLangerhans-cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare condition involving tissue infiltration by histio- cytes and other inflammatory leukocytes, includ- ing eosinophils. LCH can affect a single system or multiple systems, including the bones, skin, lungs, liver, spleen, pituitary gland, or thyroid gland.18,19 When a single system is affected, it is most com- monly the lungs. Single-system pulmonary LCH is nearly always associated with tobacco smok- ing. Most patients with multisystemic LCH with lung involvement also have a history of tobacco smoking.18\nRegardless of whether LCH is localized to the lungs or affects multiple systems, the pulmonary manifestations include diffuse cysts, which typi- cally are irregularly shaped and heterogeneous, have relatively thick walls, and are located in the upper and middle lobes. Nodules with cavitation are often found; transformation of nodules to cysts has been described.20 Some patients have dyspnea or cough, but many patients are asymp- tomatic or minimally symptomatic, and the condition is identified incidentally on chest im- aging.18,21,22 When LCH occurs in adults, the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis are most likely to occur when the patient is younger than 50 years of age. \nIn this patient, the lung imaging findings are consistent with LCH, and her ongoing tobacco smoking is a key risk factor. The eosinophil- predominant inflammatory infiltrate in the liver is also consistent with LCH; in fact, eosinophilic granuloma is a form of LCH. Taken together, these features make LCH the most likely diagnosis in this patient. The breast and thyroid lesions may be due to LCH or may be unrelated. The presenting abdominal symptoms are probably due to another process, such as infectious gastroenteritis.\nIn 30 to 50% of patients with pulmonary LCH, the diagnosis can be confirmed by means of bron- choscopy with transbronchial biopsy and BAL, which I suspect was the diagnostic test performed in this patient.2 If specimens obtained during bronchoscopy are nondiagnostic, then lung bi- opsy by means of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery should be performed.",

Biopsy Specimens.\nOn hematoxylin and eosin staining of the transbronchial biopsy specimen (Panel A), patchy foci of fibrosis and in\u2011 flammation (arrows) are scattered throughout the lung parenchyma, without a clear spatial relationship to the air\u2011\nway (arrowhead). At higher magnification (Panel B), the areas of fibrosis contain scattered eosinophils (arrowhead), small round lymphocytes, and histiocytes, as well as a proliferation of medium\u2011to\u2011large cells with amphophilic to slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nuclear grooves (arrow). On immunohistochemical staining (Panel C), these cells are strongly positive for langerin, a finding consistent with Langerhans cells. On hematoxylin and eo\u2011 sin staining of the liver\u2011biopsy specimen (Panel D), a dense focus of mixed, predominantly eosinophilic inflamma\u2011 tion (arrowhead) is present adjacent to residual hepatic parenchyma (arrow), a finding consistent with eosinophilic granuloma. On further review (Panel E), monocyte\u2011like cells with prominent nuclear grooves (arrowhead), which are similar to those observed in the transbronchial biopsy specimen, are present within the eosinophilic granuloma. On immunohistochemical staining (Panel F), these cells are positive for langerin, a finding that confirms their identity as Langerhans cells.\n",
