    "Primary Symptom": "A 14-Year-Old Girl with Swelling of the Jaw and Hypercalcemia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Austin Be (Surgery): A 14-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital because of swelling of the left jaw.\nThe patient had been well until 6 weeks before this admission, when she no- ticed a lump in the left lower jaw; there was no pain, tenderness, or discomfort in the jaw. She was evaluated in a primary care clinic of another hospital and was told that a salivary gland may be obstructed. Treatment with sialagogues, increased oral hydration, warm compresses, and massage of the salivary glands were recom- mended. During the next 3 weeks, the lump in the left jaw increased in size, and swelling of the left side of the face and neck developed. Three weeks before this admission, she returned to the primary care clinic; treatment with cephalexin was started.\nEighteen days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the otolaryngol- ogy clinic of the other hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 132/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 86 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.0. There was swelling in the left mandibular and submandibular areas, with no erythema, fluc- tuance, or palpable salivary stones.\nDr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the face and neck was per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. CT of the face (Fig. 1) revealed a 3.7-cm mass in the left mandibular body, with lytic and expansile features and numerous internal wavy septations. Areas of marked thinning and obliteration were noted in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible, and extension of the mass among the roots of the first molar, second molar, and pre- molar was observed. No fluid\u2013fluid or blood\u2013fluid levels were seen within the lesion. There was no lymphadenopathy. The patient was referred to the otolaryngol- ogy clinic at this hospital.\nDr. Be: Fifteen days before this admission, the patient reported numbness and tingling in the lower lip and chin on the left side. She had had no fatigue, fever, chills, or redness and no pain in her face, jaw, or neck. On examination, she appeared well but had obvious facial asymmetry with swell- ing of the left mandible (Fig. 2). There was a firm, mildly tender mass in the body of the left man dible that extended to the mandibular angle. Orth- odontic braces were in place and dentition and jaw occlusion were normal. The remainder of the ear, nose, and throat examination was normal. The overlying skin was normal, and no anterior or posterior submandibular or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was present. The blood levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride were normal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of coagulation and renal function. The calcium level was 11.8 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deci- liter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), and the albumin level was 4.1 g per deciliter (reference range,\n3.3 to 5.0). Radiography of the chest was normal. Dr. Vania Nos\u00e9: An intraoral biopsy of the left mandibular mass was performed. Pathological examination (Fig. 3C) of the biopsy specimen revealed that the lesion was partially surrounded by reactive bone trabeculae, was hemorrhagic, and contained numerous osteoclast-type giant cells around extravasated red cells, findings that were consistent with a central giant-cell lesion or a central giant-cell granuloma.\nDr. Be: Ten days before this admission, the patient was seen in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, and admission for the excision of the left mandibular mass was planned.\nOn admission to this hospital, additional his- tory was obtained. The patient had normal growth and development and had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had finished the prescribed course of cephalexin and had taken no other medications; penicillin had caused fever and hives early in childhood. She lived in a sub- urban area of New England with her mother, stepfather, and two cats; she frequently stayed in another suburban area of New England with her father. The patient performed well in high school and participated in theater. She did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alcohol. Her mother had hypothyroidism; her father had obstructive sleep apnea. Her maternal grandmother had a history of hypothyroidism, parathyroid ad- enoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer; her pa- ternal grandfather had died from colon cancer.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/85 mm Hg, and the heart rate 111 beats per minute. The physical examination was un- changed. The left mandibular mass was excised. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed abundant giant cells.\nOn the second hospital day, the calcium level was 12.6 mg per deciliter (3.2 mmol per liter) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 396 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60).\n\nFigure 1. CT Images of the Face.\nAxial images obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material and reconstructed in bone algo\u2011 rithm (Panel A) and in soft\u2011tissue algorithm (Panel B) show an expansile, multiloculated mass centered in the left mandibular body (Panel B, arrows) with internal wavy septations. A coronal image reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel C) shows defects in the buccal and lingual cortexes of the mandible with involvement of the alveolar process and the left mandibular first molar.\nFigure 2. Clinical Photographs before Excision of the Lesion.\nFrontal and submental views (Panels A and B, respectively) show the expansion of the left mandibular body laterally and inferiorly. Five days later, at the evaluation in the oral and maxillofacial surgical clinic of this hospital, the lesion had enlarged (Panels C and D).\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Thomas O. Carpenter: This 14-year-old girl presented with progressive swelling of the jaw. The salient features of her clinical presentation include swelling of the jaw over the course of 6 weeks; the absence of pain, which implies a recently ac- quired process; and paresthesias of the lip and chin, which suggest compression of the inferior alveolar nerve. Laboratory test results obtained just before the initial biopsy were notable for an elevation in the blood calcium level, a finding that had not previously been identified. The family history revealed the maternal grandmother\u2019s pre- vious diagnoses of parathyroid adenoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer.\nThis patient\u2019s clinical presentation reveals two problems: a mandibular mass and unexplained hypercalcemia. I will develop a differential diag- nosis for each of these findings and will consider the ways in which these two conditions may be related.\n\nMandibular Mass\nCT of the face and neck reveals a lytic, expansile lesion with thinning and partial obliteration of cortical bone. Extension of the lesion to the adjacent molars and premolars is described. The pres- ence of abundant giant cells on examination of the biopsy specimen suggests a diagnosis of a giant-cell tumor or granuloma, but the possibil- ity of other diagnoses, such as an aneurysmal bone cyst, a brown tumor, ossifying fibroma, or lytic metastases from cancer, should be consid- ered. Indeed, hypercalcemia may accompany cancer; however, the patient had been completely healthy before the development of jaw swelling, with no other signs of a systemic process, which indicates that the presence of lytic metastases is unlikely. Other processes that should be considered in this case, although they are unlikely, in- clude fibrous dysplasia of bone and multiple myeloma, both of which usually have a radiographic appearance that is considerably different from that observed in this patient and are not characteristically associated with giant cells.\nAmong the lesions that one might initially consider in this case is a giant-cell tumor of bone.\nHowever, the characteristics commonly associ- ated with such a tumor are inconsistent with this patient\u2019s reported clinical history, such that it is typically aggressive and painful, and it oc- curs more commonly in the appendicular skele- ton.1 Immunohistochemical analysis or genetic testing of the tumor may identify evidence of muta- tions in H3F3A, which occur in more than 95% of patients with such tumors.2\nAn aneurysmal bone cyst can be manifested by thinning of the bone cortex. However, such a cyst is often characterized by loculated regions and fluid levels, neither of which has been de- scribed in this case, and it is not associated with the presence of giant cells.3 Identification of a somatic genetic rearrangement of USP6, albeit unlikely, would confirm this diagnosis.4\nOssifying fibroma often occurs in the mandi- ble, but its radiographic appearance differs from that described in this patient; it is usually char- acterized by intact cortexes and the ground-glass appearance of fibrous replacement within the lesion. Giant cells are not typical of an ossifying fibroma, although it has been reported that the tumor may arise from mesenchymal cells of peri- odontal ligaments, which could be related to the dental findings in this case.5\nFinally, consideration of a brown tumor in this patient is supported by the lytic appearance and disruption of cortical bone.6 Furthermore, giant cells can be present in brown tumors. A brown tumor is a manifestation of chronic expo- sure to moderately-to-severely elevated levels of PTH, which may be the cause of this patient\u2019s hypercalcemia. Several of these tumors have simi- lar histologic features and may at times be difficult to distinguish from one another.\nHypercalcemia\nThe second feature of this patient\u2019s presentation is hypercalcemia. The first step in the evaluation of an abnormal calcium level is to confirm that the initial level of blood calcium is accurate and to ensure that the ionized or corrected calcium level (i.e., the calcium level corrected in the context of a low blood albumin level) is normal. The next step in evaluating hypercalcemia is to establish its cause. It is useful to consider mecha- nisms that would explain the hypercalcemia. Is it due to excessive bone resorption or lytic metas- tases (relevant in this case with respect to consid- eration of the jaw mass)? Is there excessive intestinal absorption of calcium? Is it a combination of these mechanisms?\n\nHypercalcemia and PTH Level\nIs this patient\u2019s elevated calcium level mediated by PTH? Non\u2013PTH-mediated bone resorption may occur in patients with hypercalcemia that is as- sociated with cancer or one of several inflamma- tory diseases (possibly due to cytokine-induced bone resorption), usually causing low circulating PTH levels. Hypervitaminosis D and defects in vitamin D metabolism (caused by mutations in CYP24A1, the gene encoding the vitamin D 24-hydroxylase)7,8 are typically manifested by hypercalcemia and suppressed PTH levels. Defects in renal phosphate transport can have secondary effects of increasing production of the active vi- tamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, thereby resulting in hypercalcemia from both in- creased intestinal calcium absorption and in- creased bone resorption, with low circulating PTH levels.9,10\nWhen this patient was admitted to the hospi-\ntal, the blood calcium level was further elevated and the circulating PTH level was markedly ele- vated, findings that confirm the diagnosis of pri- mary hyperparathyroidism. Although this condi- tion is probably caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma, multiglandular parathyroid hyperpla- sia or multiple adenomas may be present. A con- comitant elevation in the blood alkaline phospha- tase level is evidence of the sustained effect of PTH on osteoblasts.\n\nFamilial     Hyperparathyroidism     Syndromes Given this patient\u2019s family history of parathyroid adenoma in her grandmother, familial hyperpara- thyroidism syndromes \u2014 particularly multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, type 2, and type 411-13 and hyperparathyroidism\u2013jaw tumor syndrome \u2014 should be considered. In persons older than this patient, multiple endocrine neoplasia is usu- ally manifested by hyperparathyroidism and is typically associated with multiglandular disease. Hyperparathyroidism\u2013jaw tumor syndrome, which is caused by germline mutations in CDC73 (also known as HRPT2), is characterized by solitary or multiple, often asynchronous, parathyroid adeno- mas. These tumors may have aggressive patho- logical features such as fibrous bands or trabecu- lation, while still being classified as adenomas.15 Immunohistochemical staining of a biopsy specimen would indicate the absence of parafibro- min, a protein encoded by CDC73. Accompanying jaw tumors, which are typically described as os- sifying fibromas, may or may not be present; in the absence of jaw tumors, the condition can be described as familial isolated hyperparathyroid- ism. Nevertheless, uterine tumors or endometrial hyperplasia, as well as renal cysts, may also occur. Because there is an increased incidence of para- thyroid carcinoma among persons with CDC73 mutations, it is important for affected patients to undergo active lifelong surveillance.15 Indeed, patients with CDC73-related hyperparathyroidism may also present with brown tumors.16 This new focus of the current case emphasizes the impor- tance of establishing a genetic diagnosis to de- termine how best to manage the accompanying parathyroid disease.\nTo distinguish between a solitary parathyroid adenoma and multiglandular parathyroid hyper- plasia, imaging of the parathyroid glands is war- ranted.17 Such imaging may also inform the surgeon as to the most appropriate approach for parathyroidectomy. Multiple imaging methods are available, including radionuclide scanning (with the use of technetium-99m\u2013labeled sestamibi), dynamic CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. I would opt for ultrasonogra- phy in this young patient in order to avoid expo- sure to the radiation that is inherent with CT and radionuclide scans.\nHow does the finding of hyperparathyroidism influence the diagnosis of the mandibular mass? The possibility of the diagnosis of an atypical ossifying fibroma is increased, given its occur- rence in the context of hyperparathyroidism due to CDC73 mutations. Nevertheless, brown tumors are a complication of hyperparathyroidism, and the reported biopsy and radiographic findings are more consistent with this type of lesion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Jordan S. Sherwood: Additional laboratory testing performed after the excision of the mandibular mass was notable for a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 13 ng per milliliter (32 nmol per liter; reference range, 33 to 96 ng per milli- liter [82 to 240 nmol per liter]) and a 1,25-dihy- droxyvitamin D level of 154 pg per milliliter (370 pmol per liter; reference range, 24 to 86 pg per milliliter [58 to 206 pmol per liter]). The phos- phorus level was 2.6 mg per deciliter (0.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 3.0 to 4.5 mg per deci- liter [1.0 to 1.5 mmol per liter]). A random urine sample revealed hypercalciuria; the ratio of cal- cium to creatinine was elevated at 0.8 (reference value, <0.2). These laboratory findings were con- sistent with PTH-dependent hypercalcemia. Re- view of the previously obtained imaging study, as well as additional imaging, was performed for disease localization of the primary hyperparathy- roidism.\nDr. Kelly: Further review of the CT images of the neck (Fig. 4A and 4B), which had been ob- tained before the biopsy of the mandibular mass, after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a 2-cm nodule in the left tra- cheoesophageal groove, immediately posterior to the mid-to-upper pole of the left lobe of the thy- roid gland, consistent with a parathyroid adeno- ma. This parathyroid adenoma was hypoattenu- ating relative to the adjacent thyroid parenchyma when viewed in a narrow soft-tissue window. An ultrasound image of the neck (Fig. 4C) showed the parathyroid adenoma as a hypoechoic nodule separate from and posterior to the left lobe of the thyroid gland.\n\nFigure 4. CT and Ultrasound Images of the Neck.\nAxial and coronal CT images of the neck (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material (and at the same time as the CT images of the face), show a nodule (arrows) in the left tracheoesophageal groove, immediately poste\u2011 rior to the mid\u2011to\u2011upper pole of the left lobe of the thy\u2011 roid gland. This nodule was hypoattenuating relative to the adjacent thyroid parenchyma. A transverse ultraso\u2011 nographic image of the neck (Panel C) confirms that this hypoechoic lesion (arrow) in the left tracheo\u2011 esophageal groove is separate from the thyroid gland (and does not arise within the thyroid parenchyma), a feature that is consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.\n",
