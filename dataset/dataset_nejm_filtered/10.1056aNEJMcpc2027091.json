    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Matthew B. Roberts (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman with a history of end-stage liver disease due to alcohol use disorder was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal distention, fatigue, and acute kidney injury that occurred 10 months after orthotopic liver transplantation.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, fatigue, weakness, and anorexia de- veloped, along with associated myalgias and night sweats. Three days before the current admission, three to five episodes of nonbloody, watery diarrhea occurred. The next day, symptoms did not abate, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. She reported no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, or swelling of the legs. The temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 76/49 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air. She appeared thin and frail. There was abdominal distention without tenderness. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The blood cre- atinine level was 3.25 mg per deciliter (287 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.55 to 1.30 mg per deciliter [49 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), which was higher than the level obtained 1 month earlier (1.27 mg per deciliter [112 \u03bcmol per liter]). The blood sodium level was 120 mmol per liter (reference range, 136 to 146) and the potassium level 6.3 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.6 to 5.2); additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nThree liters of fluids, hydrocortisone, piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, and vancomycin were administered intravenously, and the blood pressure increased. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, revealed a large volume of ascitic fluid and scattered areas of high-density material. Paracentesis was performed, and 1300 ml of as- citic fluid was removed. Analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for more than 1000 red cells per microliter, 2099 nucleated cells per microliter (with 400 neutro- phils per microliter), and numerous atypical cells that were not further character- ized. Blood and ascitic fluid specimens were obtained for culture.\nOn the second hospital day, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital because of concern for sepsis. She reported persistent fatigue, weakness, myalgias, and watery diarrhea.\nAdditional history was obtained. Twenty-two months before this admission, the patient had been admitted to the other hospital because of abnormal results on liver-function tests. She had received a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis com- plicated by cirrhosis with ascites. Treatment with a short course of prednisone had been initi- ated, furosemide administered, and large-vol- ume paracentesis performed for the manage- ment of ascites. The patient had been advised to discontinue alcohol consumption. Ten months later, and 12 months before the current admis- sion, the patient had been admitted to this hos- pital because of decompensated liver disease complicated by hepatorenal syndrome. Renal replacement therapy had been initiated, and small-volume paracentesis had been performed to obtain ascitic fluid for cytologic and hemato- logic analysis.\nDr. Robert P. Hasserjian: Analysis of the ascitic\nfluid performed 12 months before the current admission had been notable for 44 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 1% were lympho- cytes, 53% monocytes, 17% macrophages, and 29% atypical-appearing plasma cells (Fig. 1A). These findings had prompted flow cytometric analysis of the ascitic fluid, which had revealed a clonal plasma cell population with lambda light-chain restriction (Fig. 1B) but no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell popu- lation.\nDr. Roberts: Twelve  months before the current\nadmission, the serum IgG level had been 1394 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295), the IgA level 885 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309), and the IgM level 177 mg per decili- ter (reference range, 53 to 334). Serum protein electrophoresis had revealed a diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level in a normal pattern; no monoclonal protein had been detected on immunofixation. The serum level of free kappa light chains had been 246.2 mg per liter (refer- ence range, 3.3 to 19.4) and the level of free lambda light chains 78.4 mg per liter (reference range, 5.7 to 26.3), with a kappa:lambda ratio of\n3.14 (reference range, 0.26 to 1.65). A bone mar- row biopsy had been performed, and analysis of the bone marrow had revealed 5% plasma cells, which were polytypic for kappa and lambda light chains on in situ hybridization. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow had revealed no clonal plasma cells or abnormal lymphocytes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT of the chest, abdo- men, and pelvis had revealed a cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension, including abdominal varices and ascites, but no focal masses or lymphadenopathy.\nTaken together, these findings had been con- sidered to be due to liver disease, an inflamma-  tory state, and kidney dysfunction, and the pa- tient had been listed for  liver  transplantation.  Ten months before the current admission, or- thotopic liver transplantation had been per- formed. Pretransplantation testing for Epstein\u2013 Barr virus (EBV) IgG and cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG had been positive in both the donor and the recipient. The explanted native liver had shown micronodular cirrhosis with mildly  inflamed  septa and evidence of iron overload. The imme- diate post-transplantation course had been no- table for intraperitoneal hemorrhage, as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium bactere- mia and recurrent peritonitis. The patient had  been discharged to a rehabilitation  facility  21  days after transplantation.\nThree months after liver transplantation, and 7 months before the current admission, biliary stent obstruction and multidrug-resistant Kleb\u00ad siella pneumoniae bacteremia had developed. The biliary stent had been removed and intravenous antibiotic agents administered. Four months before the current admission, asymptomatic CMV viremia had developed. Outpatient treat- ment with valganciclovir had been initiated. The patient had remained well until the current ad- mission.\nAt the time of the current admission, medica- tions included aspirin, atovaquone, vitamin B complex,  calcium  citrate,  vitamin  D3, ferrous sulfate,   f ludrocortisone,   gabapentin, magnesium, melatonin, mycophenolate, omeprazole,prednisone,  tacrolimus,  and  ursodiol. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was born in New England and lived with her mother. She had not traveled outside the region, and there had been no animal exposures. The patient had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking ciga- rettes approximately 2 years before the current admission. There was no illicit drug use. Her mother and father both had cardiac and liver disease; her maternal grandfather also had liver disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/53 mm Hg, the heart rate 114 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21. The patient appeared thin and frail. An abdominal examination revealed mod- erate distention, shifting dullness, and softness without tenderness. There was no hepatospleno- megaly or lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with intravenous cefepime and linezolid and oral van- comycin was initiated, and intravenous fluids were continued. Blood, urine, and stool speci- mens were obtained for culture.\nDr. Mark A. Anderson: PET-CT of the chest, ab-\ndomen, and pelvis revealed multifocal, predomi- nantly peritoneal FDG-avid masses, as well as diffuse FDG uptake along the surface of large- bowel and small-bowel loops (Fig. 2). These findings had not been present on a CT scan obtained 1 year earlier.\nDr. Roberts: Testing for Clostridioides difficile\ntoxin in stool was positive. Treatment with intra- venous antibiotics was stopped, and oral vanco- mycin was continued. The diarrhea abated, and the hypotension resolved. On the third hospital day, the blood creatinine level decreased to 2.25 mg per deciliter (199 \u03bcmol per liter); other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood, urine, and stool cultures were negative. Diag- nostic paracentesis was performed, and analysis of the ascitic fluid was notable for 2018 nucle- ated cells per microliter, of which 30% were unclassified; additional results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Ascitic Fluid Specimen Obtained before Transplantation.\nOn cytologic analysis of the ascitic fluid (Panel A), Papanicolaou staining shows numerous atypical plasmacytoid cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli, as well as occasional small, mature lymphocytes. On flow cytometric analysis of the ascitic fluid (Panel B), numerous CD38 and CD138\u2013gated plasma cells are positive for cytoplasmic lambda (L+ PC; shown in blue), and very few plasma cells are positive for cytoplasmic kappa (K+ PC; shown in red). The green population, which is negative for kappa and lambda, represents nonplasma cells. FITC\u2011A and PE\u2011A are the fluorochrome labels of the antibodies used to detect kappa and lambda light chains, respectively.\n\nFigure 2.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "multiple myeloma;Hypergammaglobulinemia;Primary Effusion Lymphoma",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sundar Jagannath: This 34-year-old woman had a history of alcoholic hepatitis that was compli- cated by cirrhosis with ascites. Hepatorenal syn- drome developed, and she was treated with renal replacement therapy followed by liver transplan- tation. Her post-transplantation course was complicated by multiple infections, for which she received antibiotics. The current hospitaliza- tion, 10 months after liver transplantation, was precipitated by C. difficile infection that resulted in diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, acute kid- ney injury, and metabolic disarray. After the patient received intravenous fluids and oral van- comycin for the treatment of C. difficile infection, the diarrhea abated and the hypotension re- solved. However, during the current illness, imaging of the abdomen and pelvis revealed large-volume ascites, as well as multifocal, pre- dominantly peritoneal FDG-avid masses and diffuse, moderate FDG uptake along the surface of multiple bowel loops.\n\nInfection\nIn constructing a differential diagnosis for these abnormal imaging findings, I will first consider infectious causes. This patient was immunosup- pressed and had a history of recurrent peritoni- tis. Patients with tuberculous peritonitis can present with ascites. They can also present with loculated intraabdominal abscess, but this pa- tient did not have evidence of matted bowel and omentum preventing the free flow of ascitic fluid on PET-CT. In addition, she did not have other PET-CT findings that are typical of tuber- culous peritonitis, including enlarged, possibly necrotic retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes and thickened omentum. The absence of fever and constitutional symptoms makes tuber- culous peritonitis unlikely, although immuno- suppression could have blunted the development of fever.\n\nCancer\nThis patient\u2019s ascites is most likely related to a solid or hematologic cancer. She could have peri- toneal carcinomatosis due to ovarian, gastric, or breast cancer. We have not been told whether there was an abnormal breast examination in this patient. Imaging did not reveal an ovarian or gastric mass, instead showing predominantly peritoneal masses. Patients with primary perito- neal mesothelioma can present with large peri- toneal masses that may be nodular, with or with- out ascites. Although primary peritoneal mesothelioma is very rare, it remains a possi- bility in this case.\n\nPrimary Effusion Lymphoma\nPatients with primary effusion lymphoma, which is a large B-cell lymphoma, usually present with serous effusions (e.g., pleural effusion or asci- tes), without masses. Primary effusion lympho- ma most often occurs in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection but can also occur in those who have undergone solidorgan transplantation. Primary effusion lym- phoma has been associated with human herpes- virus 8 (HHV-8) infection. We have not been specifically given the patient\u2019s status with re- spect to HHV-8 infection, but she has been fol- lowed in the transplantation clinic while receiv- ing immunosuppression and would have been monitored for reactivation of EBV infection. Al- though I cannot rule out primary effusion lym- phoma, I will consider other, more likely expla- nations for her presentation.\n\nPost-transplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder\nPost-transplantation lymphoproliferative disor- der (PTLD) that is associated with EBV com- monly causes lymphadenopathy, hepatospleno- megaly, subcutaneous nodules, or tonsillar enlargement, and none of these features were present in this patient. Ascites can be a pre- senting sign of PTLD, although it is rare1,2; therefore, PTLD remains a possible  diagnosis in this case. The ascitic f luid analysis per- formed at the time of the current admission revealed 2018 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 11% were neutrophils and 30% unclassi- fied. This finding leads me to consider the clinical significance of the atypical cells noted on the ascitic f luid analysis performed before transplantation. Flow cytometric analysis of the atypical cells that was performed at that time revealed a clonal plasma cell population with lambda light-chain restriction. This finding led to a serum workup, which showed hypergam- maglobulinemia.\n\nHypergammaglobulinemia\nThe differential diagnosis for hypergammaglob- ulinemia in this patient before liver transplanta- tion includes benign conditions and cancers. Chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheuma- toid arthritis, scleroderma, or Hashimoto\u2019s thy- roiditis), chronic skin diseases (e.g., pyoderma gangrenosum or necrobiotic xanthogranuloma- tosis), and chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, HIV infection, or bacterial endocarditis) are be- nign causes of hypergammaglobulinemia. This patient did not have any of these conditions, but she did have chronic liver disease, which is an- other benign cause of hypergammaglobulinemia. Cancers that can cause hypergammaglobulinemia (e.g., plasma cell disorders, lymphoma, or leuke- mia) should also be considered. Plasma cell disorders include monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), asymptom- atic (smoldering) multiple myeloma, multiple myeloma, and AL amyloidosis (also known as primary or light-chain amyloidosis).\nBefore transplantation, this patient was eval- uated for plasma cell disorders. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation revealed that the hypergammaglobulinemia was polyclonal, a finding confirmed by increased levels of IgG and IgA with a normal level of IgM. Levels of both free kappa and free lambda light chains were elevated, with a ratio of 3.14. This ratio is higher than the normal range (0.26 to 1.65) but within the reference range for a patient receiving hemodialysis (0.37 to 3.10), as this patient was at the time. Evaluation of the bone marrow was negative for a clonal plasma cell population. PET-CT showed a cirrhotic liver with evidence of portal hypertension, including upper abdominal varices and ascites, but no lymphadenopathy or masses.\nTherefore, the patient\u2019s polyclonal hypergam-\nmaglobulinemia was attributed to her known liver disease. The liver plays an important role in removing antigens and endotoxins that arise from the gut. In patients with chronic liver dis- ease that is complicated by portal hypertension, antigens and endotoxins from the gut  bypass the liver through collateral circulation and reach the antibody-producing cells, resulting in hyper- gammaglobulinemia.3 In such patients, the gam- ma globulin level returns to normal within a week after liver transplantation.4\nHowever, this patient presented 10 months after liver transplantation with a persistently ele- vated globulin gap, as well as new anemia and persistent kidney injury, features that suggest the possibility of multiple myeloma. To deter- mine whether this patient had multiple myeloma, I would perform a cytologic evaluation of the ascitic fluid or of a biopsy specimen of the peritoneal mass.\n\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Multiple myeloma",
    "Diagnosis": "Plasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma)",
    "Key testing": "a core biopsy of the mesenteric mass;bone marrow biopsy",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Hasserjian: The diagnostic procedure in this case was a core biopsy of the mesenteric mass. The mass contained sheets of large cells (Fig. 3A) that were positive for MUM1, CD138, CD56, and lambda light chains (Fig. 3B, 3C, and 3D) and were negative for CD20, CD19, kappa light chains, HHV-8, and EBV (on Epstein\u2013Barr en- coding region in situ hybridization). The large cells also strongly expressed MYC and had a Ki-67 proliferation index of 80%. Similar cells were seen in the ascitic fluid. Flow cytometric analy- sis of the ascitic fluid revealed that they were clonal plasma cells that expressed monotypic lambda light chains.\nA bone marrow biopsy was also performed. The bone marrow contained clusters of large, neoplastic plasma cells with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3E). On analysis of a smear of bone marrow aspirate, 15% of the cells were highly atypical plasma cells with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 3F). On flow cytometric analysis, these cells ex- pressed monotypic lambda light chains. Fluores- cence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the bone marrow aspirate revealed a MYC rearrangement, an IGH rearrangement, a 1q22 duplication, and a deletion of the TP53 locus at 17p13.1. Next-gen- eration sequencing revealed pathogenic variants in HRAS, STAT3, and ARID1A. Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation showed an IgA lambda M component (2.28 g per deciliter). The overall findings confirmed a diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma with plasmablastic fea- tures. Plasmablastic plasma cell myeloma has morphologic and immunophenotypic features similar to those of plasmablastic lymphoma, but plasmablastic lymphoma is usually positive for EBV and is not typically associated with a high serum paraprotein level. Although a clonal plas- ma cell population had been identified in the ascitic fluid in this patient before liver trans- plantation, the unusual fluid-based presentation in the absence of tissue masses, bone marrow involvement, and paraprotein had precluded a definitive diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma at that time; in rare cases, clonal plasma cells may be identified in fluid specimens in reactive con- ditions.5,6 Nevertheless, because this clonal plas- ma cell population had been present before the patient\u2019s liver transplantation, the plasma cell\nmyeloma was not considered to be a PTLD.\n",
