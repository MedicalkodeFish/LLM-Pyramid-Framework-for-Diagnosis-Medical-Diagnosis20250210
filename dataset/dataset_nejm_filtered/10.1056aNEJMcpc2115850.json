    "Primary Symptom": "A 14-Year-Old Boy with Fever, Joint Pain, and Abdominal Cramping",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Micaela Atkins (Pediatrics): A 14-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital be- cause of fatigue, fever, joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fatigue and fever developed on his final day of summer camp. He was taken to the pri- mary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.\nNine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the pa- tient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemo- lytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had pos- sible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.\nSix days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left knee developed, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test for Lyme disease was performed.\nOn the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. On evaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness, swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills, intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respira- tory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and inter- mittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena.\nThe patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech devel-\nopment that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross and fine motor skills and growth. He had re- portedly received all routine childhood vaccina- tions. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and tree nuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early child- hood. Medications included amoxicillin\u2013clavula- nate, inhaled f luticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.\nAt the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school. Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England, where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of New England, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog. His sister had recently had an acute gastrointes- tinal illness that resolved after several days. The patient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypo- thyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheuma- toid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate 107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth, swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymph-adenopathy.\nThe white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the eryth- rocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (ref- erence range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60). Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nWhile the patient was in the emergency de- partment, the temperature increased to 39.2\u00b0C. Intravenous fluids were administered, and em- pirical treatment with doxycycline was started. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nDuring the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diar- rhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level\n178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive. A plain film of the right shoulder was normal.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Kerstin Zanger: This previously healthy 14-year- old boy presented with fatigue, fever, sore throat, joint pain, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomit- ing, and watery diarrhea. The laboratory test results were notable for elevated levels of in- flammatory markers and mild leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance. Among his mainly nonspecific symptoms, the two that stand out are fever and joint pain. As I develop a differen- tial diagnosis, I will focus on infectious and noninfectious causes of these symptoms.\n\nInfectious Causes\nJoint Infection\nPatients with septic arthritis have an acute pre- sentation with high-grade fevers and, usually, a single warm and swollen joint, most commonly in the lower leg. Approximately 80% of cases involve the knee, hip, or ankle.1 Up to 10% of cases involve more than one joint. When multi- ple joints are involved, infection with neisseria species or Staphylococcus aureus must be considered. Patients with septic arthritis usually have de- creased range of motion and loss of function in the affected joint, as well as extreme pain with both active and passive movement of the joint, features that were not present in this patient.\n\nLyme Disease\nLyme disease is a tickborne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Symptoms of early localized Lyme disease, which develop within a few days after the tick bite, include fatigue, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, and fevers.2 Erythema mi- grans occurs in approximately 80% of patients, so the absence of a rash does not rule out the infection. Arthralgias occur in 33% of patients during early disease and may be the only mani- festation of the infection. Joint pain is often transient and migratory; it usually lingers at one site for hours or days. Gastrointestinal symptoms are uncommon during early localized Lyme dis- ease, but they can be part of the initial influenza- like illness associated with the infection.\n \nThis patient lived in an area where Lyme dis- ease is endemic and had been camping in the woods, so this infection must be considered. However, he had been treated with amoxicillin\u2013 clavulanate for 12 days and with doxycycline for 3 days; both of these agents are highly effective against Lyme disease. Antibiotic resistance in B. burgdorferi has not been observed.3\n\nReactive and Viral Arthritis\nReactive arthritis occurs in response to an infec- tion that developed days or weeks earlier. In chil- dren, the most common cause is an enteric bacterial infection due to salmonella, shigella, yersinia, or campylobacter species or Escherichia coli. Such an infection would cause bloody diar- rhea and abdominal pain and would be associ- ated with positive fecal occult blood testing. After an enteric infection, enthesitis is more common than arthritis.\nArthritis due to parvovirus B19 occurs in less than 10% of infected children, as compared with 60% of infected adults. Children with arthritis due to parvovirus B19 initially have mild upper respiratory symptoms, followed by fever, rash, and polyarthritis. Levels of inflammatory mark- ers may be mildly elevated but are normal in more than 50% of cases. Fevers are usually low grade.\nThis patient\u2019s arthralgias occurred concur- rently with gastrointestinal symptoms. In addi- tion, he had high-grade fevers and elevated levels of inflammatory markers. Therefore, a diagno- sis of reactive or viral arthritis is unlikely.\n\nWhipple\u2019s Disease\nWhipple\u2019s disease is an enteric infection due to Tropheryma whipplei. The disease is not associated with a clear inflammatory and immunologic response. However, it results in clinical symp- toms that are consistent with this patient\u2019s pre- sentation, including arthritis, intermittent diar- rhea, and colicky abdominal pain. It has been described as a mimicker of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).4 Whipple\u2019s disease usually affects White middle-aged men of European ancestry and is extremely uncommon in children. Yet cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by infection with T. whipplei have been described in very young children in Europe and Africa.5 Because Whip- ple\u2019s disease is not associated with fever and is a rare condition, it can be ruled out in this patient.\n\nNoninfectious Causes\nSystemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\nSystemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is charac- terized by fever with a daily spike in temperature (>38.5\u00b0C) and with normal or subnormal tem- peratures during the rest of the 24-hour period. Affected patients often appear ill when they are febrile and otherwise appear well. This condi- tion is also characterized by arthritis, which can involve any joint and any number of joints but most often occurs in the lower leg.6 In 81% of patients, an evanescent salmon-pink rash devel- ops, although it is sometimes difficult to see. The rash usually is triggered by heat or fever and fades when the body temperature is normal. It often involves the axillae and the area around the waist but can occur anywhere on the body. Patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthri- tis typically have leukocytosis with a white-cell count of 20,000 to 30,000 per microliter and neutrophilic predominance.\nThis patient\u2019s fever did not occur on a daily\nbasis, and he did not have a rash. In addition, to establish the diagnosis of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, fever must be present for at least 2 weeks and arthritis for at least 6 weeks. Therefore, the diagnosis can be ruled out in this patient.\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\nMost children with a new diagnosis of IBD pres- ent with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, tenesmus, and growth failure. Arthritis and arthral gias are frequent extraintestinal manifestations; they occur more commonly in patients who have Crohn\u2019s disease with colonic involvement than in patients who have ulcerative colitis, and they are often associated with other extraintestinal features, such as aphthous stomatitis.7 Approxi- mately 6% of pediatric patients have extraintes- tinal symptoms at the time of initial presenta- tion. Arthritis due to IBD is self-limiting and nonerosive, and it is not associated with specific autoantibodies or HLA types. Peripheral arthri- tis tends to be acute, occurs early in the disease course, and involves few joints. There is often evidence of joint swelling and effusion, most commonly involving the knee. The shoulder is affected in only 4 to 9% of patients.8\nElevations in the white-cell count and levels\nof inflammatory markers reflect the activity of intestinal disease and not the severity of arthritis. Approximately one third of pediatric patients with IBD have a normal white-cell count and normal levels of inflammatory markers at the time of diagnosis.9 Children with IBD often \u201cfall off\u201d the growth curve long before the diagnosis is made. An early sign of growth failure is a decrease in height velocity.\nThe most likely diagnosis in this patient is IBD. His initial vague gastrointestinal symptoms are atypical of this condition; however, arthral- gias and oral aphthous ulcers are both common extraintestinal manifestations. He did not have frankly bloody stools, which could explain why the hemoglobin level was only mildly decreased. The decreased albumin level and mildly elevated lipase level are consistent with a diagnosis of IBD, and the elevated levels of inflammatory markers support the diagnosis.\nSeveral features of this patient\u2019s presentation give me pause. Presentation with arthralgias as the dominant symptom and with only mild gas- trointestinal symptoms is highly unusual, as is the fact that the most affected joint was his shoulder. Also, he did not have a history of weight loss or growth failure; the absence of these fea- tures suggests a recent and rapid onset of ill- ness. Despite his somewhat unusual presentation, I think IBD is the most likely diagnosis in this case. To establish this diagnosis, I would per- form colonoscopy and upper endoscopy.\n\n",

    "Diagnosis": "Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\u2019s disease)",
    "Key testing": "",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Katherine Nimkin: The first diagnostic test was computed tomographic enterography (CTE), per- formed after the administration of oral and in- travenous contrast material. Coronal images (Fig. 1) showed mural thickening and enhance- ment involving at least 20 cm of distal ileum, a finding consistent with ileitis. The comb sign \u2014 dilated, widely spaced, enhancing vasa recta\n\u2014 was present, a finding that reflects bowel inflammation.\nIleitis can be associated with a variety of con- ditions. Crohn\u2019s disease is usually the leading diagnosis. Patients with ulcerative colitis may have distal ileitis, referred to as backwash ileitis. Reactive ileitis can occur when there is an adjacent inflammatory process, such as appendicitis. Infectious ileitis can be caused by a variety of bacterial and viral pathogens; tuberculous ileitis may be seen in areas where the pathogen is en- demic. Rarer causes include lymphoma, ischemia, vasculitis, and the use of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs.10\nWhen Crohn\u2019s disease is suspected, cross- sectional imaging is indicated. Ultrasonography is performed at some centers, but the examina- tion is operator dependent and time consuming. CTE and magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) can be used in the evaluation for Crohn\u2019s disease. Both techniques involve the ingestion of a large volume of oral contrast material, as well as the use of intravenous contrast material. It is appropriate to perform CTE as the first cross- sectional examination or when an abscess or perforation is suspected. CTE is fast and easily accessible, and young patients are less likely to\n \nbe sedated during CTE than during MRE. In comparison, MRE is performed without the use of ionizing radiation and provides a more de- tailed evaluation of disease activity and bowel motility. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis is the study of choice in the evaluation for suspected perianal disease.\nFeatures of active Crohn\u2019s disease on CTE and MRE include mural thickening and enhance- ment, with a striated pattern of mural enhance- ment, as well as engorged vasa recta. Both techniques can be used to assess for stricture formation, fistulae, and abscesses and to detect extraintestinal disease, such as sacroiliitis or sclerosing cholangitis.11\nDr. Esther J. Israel: After the patient underwent CTE, endoscopy was performed. On endoscopic examination, the colon appeared normal, apart from the presence of a few scattered white le- sions with red bases, which were suggestive of aphthous ulcers (Fig. 2A). The terminal ileum showed mild diffuse inflammation that was characterized by erosions, erythema, loss of vas- cularity, mucus, and aphthous ulceration (Fig. 2B). Biopsy specimens were obtained. On perianal ex- amination, hemorrhoids were present (Fig. 2C).\n\nFigure 1. Images from CT Enterography.\nIn Panels A and B, coronal images show mural enhancement and mild thickening (arrows) involving approximately 20 cm of distal ileum, extending to the terminal ileum. Panel B also shows engorged vasa recta (arrowhead), known as the comb sign, a finding that reflects hypervascularity of the mesentery.\n",
