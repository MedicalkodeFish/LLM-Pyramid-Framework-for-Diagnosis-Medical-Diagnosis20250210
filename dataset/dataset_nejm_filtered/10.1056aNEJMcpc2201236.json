    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Dilara Hatipoglu (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroenter- ology clinic of this hospital because of relapsing chronic diarrhea and a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy.\nDiarrhea had initially developed in the patient during infancy. When the patient was 2 months of age, he had poor growth and frequent bowel movements with loose stools. When he began to eat solid foods, diarrhea continued, and a hydro- lyzed-protein diet was started. His parents were instructed to remove dairy, soy, and gluten from his diet, but diarrhea did not  abate. Allergy skin-prick testing  with cow\u2019s milk and soy antigens was negative.\nWhen the patient was 10 months of age, failure to thrive and diarrhea per- sisted, and generalized edema and nephrotic syndrome developed. Esophagogas- troduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and histopathological examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyper- plasia, and diffuse inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy reportedly showed mild degenerative changes of the surface epithelium and mild focal micro- villous atrophy; there were no immune deposits, and the basement membrane was normal.\nRenal biopsy was also performed, and histopathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen revealed glomeruli with diffuse thickening of the basement mem- brane; there was no proliferation of cells or mesangial matrix. Transmission elec- tron microscopy showed total effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes and an irregularly thickened glomerular basement membrane with numerous subepi- thelial and intramembranous electron-dense deposits. The patient received a work- ing diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome due to membranous glomerulonephritis, and treatment with prednisone was started.\nDiarrhea abated, proteinuria and generalized edema resolved, and growth re- sumed. However, during the next 2 years, intermittent relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome occurred when the dose of prednisone was decreased. When the patient was 3 years of age, treatment with chlorambucil was started for recur- rent membranous glomerulonephritis, and there were no relapses for 1 year.\nWhen the patient was 4 years of age, there was a recurrence of diarrhea associated with fever and hemolytic anemia. Stool culture, stool testing for Clostridioides difficile toxin, and exami- nation of the stool for ova and parasites were all negative. EGD was performed, and histopatho- logical examination of a small-intestinal biopsy specimen reportedly revealed villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and active enteritis. The blood IgE level was 501 IU per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 100). The blood level of endomysial antibodies was not elevated, but anti\u2013epithelial cell antibodies were detected. The patient re- ceived a diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, and treatment with intravenous glucocorticoids and cyclosporine was begun.\nAfter several months, treatment with gluco- corticoids and cyclosporine was stopped, and tacrolimus was begun. Tacrolimus was stopped after several years, when the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved. From 5 to 13 years of age, he had no enteropathy, anemia, or nephropathy.\nBeginning at 13 years of age, the patient was hospitalized for recurrences of diarrhea and ne- phropathy every 2 to 4 years during the 20 years before this evaluation. Six years before this evaluation, EGD and colonoscopy were per- formed, and the duodenal and colonic mucosa appeared diffusely edematous. Biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a duodenal biopsy specimen (Fig. 1) revealed marked villous blunting, an increase in lymphoplasmacytic in- flammatory cells in the lamina propria (known as lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria), and a patchy increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. Examination of a colonic biopsy specimen revealed mild focal active colitis that spared the rectum.\nDr. Hatipoglu: Treatment with intravenous abated. For the next 2 years, relapses of diarrhea and nephrotic syndrome were treated with intra- venous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone in combination with cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.\nFour years before this evaluation, antibodies against the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor were not detected. Renal biopsy was  performed,\nand histopathological examination of a renal bi- opsy specimen again revealed evidence of mem- branous glomerulonephritis. Treatment was changed to prednisone, budesonide, and abatacept, and symptoms abated. After 2 years, the patient stopped taking abatacept. After another 2 years, diarrhea recurred, and the patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital.\nIn the gastroenterology clinic, additional his- tory was obtained. There was a history of hyper- tension, gallstones, and rosacea. Eczema had developed when the patient was 10 months of age and had occurred intermittently into adult- hood; it had abated with the administration of immunosuppressive agents. Anaphylactic shock had occurred when the patient was 2 years of age after he had been exposed to uncooked egg. At that time, allergy testing was performed, and the patient\u2019s parents were instructed to remove eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish from his diet, in addition to removing dairy, soy, and gluten.\nCurrent medications included prednisone, budesonide, and losartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a Mid-Atlantic state and worked as a salesperson. He did not smoke tobacco and drank beer rarely. His family history included ovarian cancer in his mother and skin cancer in his father; his brother was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/94 mm Hg, the heart rate 106 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.1. The patient had short stature and diffuse erythema of the face and neck. There was mild tenderness in the left lower ab- domen. The results of a lactulose breath test were normal, as was the fecal calprotectin level. Testing for antibodies to tissue transglutamin ase was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, and the findings were consis- tent with duodenitis, gastritis, and atrophy of the colon. Biopsy specimens were obtained.\nDr. Shroff: Histopathological examination of\nileal and duodenal biopsy specimens (Fig. 1) re- vealed villous blunting, lymphoplasmacytic ex- pansion of the lamina propria, and intraepithe- lial lymphocytosis.\nFigure 1. Small-Intestinal Biopsy Specimens.\nOn hematoxylin and eosin staining, a specimen of duodenal mucosa obtained 6 years before this presentation (Panel A) shows marked villous blunting (arrows) and lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria. A specimen of duodenal mucosa obtained at presentation (Panels B and C) shows marked villous blunting (Panel B, arrows), lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (Panels B and C, asterisks). A specimen of ileal mucosa obtained at presentation (Panel D) shows findings similar to those observed in the duodenum, with mild villous blunting (arrows), lymphoplasmacytic expansion of the lamina propria, and an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (asterisks).\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Francis P. Colizzo: I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the final diagnosis. This 33-year-old man had a long-standing diag- nosis of autoimmune enteropathy, which had been complicated by hemolytic anemia, membra- nous nephropathy with proteinuria, and eczema. Symptoms were intermittently controlled with the administration of glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents, but full and durable remission was never established. Could the pa- tient\u2019s current presentation with relapsing diar- rhea be caused by persistence or exacerbation of his primary condition, autoimmune enteropathy? Or could it be caused by another condition that he acquired because of chronic immunosuppres- sion? Alternatively, could his diagnosis of auto- immune enteropathy, which he had carried for most of his life, be incorrect? The first step in caring for this patient is to reconsider the dif- ferential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea and mal- absorption that can occur in association with villous atrophy and enteropathy.\n\nAutoimmune Enteropathy\nAutoimmune enteropathy is a rare condition that is more common among infants and children than among adults. It can occur as a primary process or be due to another immune-mediated process. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. Extraintestinal manifestations can include hemolytic anemia, nephritis, and dermatitis, all of which had oc- curred in this patient. Thyroiditis and hepatitis have also been reported as extraintestinal mani- festations of autoimmune enteropathy.\nThe proposed diagnostic criteria for autoim- mune enteropathy include the detection of vil- lous atrophy on biopsy of the small intestine,along with a decrease in goblet cells in the tis- sue; the presence of antienterocyte antibodies; and chronic diarrhea with malabsorption.1 Anti\u2013 epithelial cell antibodies had been detected in this patient when he was 4 years of age. At that time, antienterocyte antibody testing was not yet available, and the patient met criteria for the diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy. When I initially evaluated this patient, serum testing for antienterocyte antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:10. However, potential causes other than autoimmune enteropathy were considered, given the refractory nature of the diarrhea and the other substantial clinical symptoms.\n\nCeliac Disease\nPatients with celiac disease also have diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. Extraintestinal manifestations can include IgA nephropathy and dermatitis herpetiformis, neither of which had occurred in this patient. In addition, celiac dis- ease is not typically associated with hemolytic anemia,2 which had been a prominent feature of this patient\u2019s disease course.\nIn patients with celiac disease, serologic evaluation confirms the presence of tissue trans- glutaminase IgA; if the patient has selective IgA deficiency, tissue transglutaminase IgG can be measured. In this patient, serologic testing for tissue transglutaminase IgA was negative in the absence of IgA deficiency. Furthermore, celiac disease is treated with elimination of gluten from the diet, and this patient\u2019s symptoms did not abate with dietary gluten elimination. Col- lagenous sprue is a rare subtype of celiac disease that is often refractory to conventional treat- ment, but it is characterized by the presence of a subepithelial collagen band on histopathologi- cal examination of a biopsy specimen from the small intestine, a finding that was not seen in this patient.\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\nInflammatory bowel disease can cause diarrhea and malabsorption, but it rarely develops in in- fancy. However, an entity described as very-early- onset inflammatory bowel disease has been re- ported; it has been associated with certain genetic variants.3 Although inflammatory bowel disease is not typically associated with renal manifestations, granulomatous interstitial ne- phritis and IgA nephropathy have been reported in some patients with inflammatory bowel dis- ease.4,5 This patient had no evidence of inflam- matory bowel disease on endoscopy, and his fe- cal calprotectin level was normal.\n\nSmall-Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth\nSmall-intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a con- dition characterized by bloating, diarrhea, and cramping. It is caused by excessive small-bowel colonization with colonic microbes and is treat- ed with oral antibiotic agents. This patient had no confirmed underlying conditions that are known to confer a predisposition to small-intes- tinal bacterial overgrowth, such as inflamma- tory bowel disease, diverticula in the small in- testine, intestinal resections, motility disorders, diabetes, scleroderma, or IgA deficiency. In ad- dition, his extraintestinal manifestations would not be explained by small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth. A lactulose breath test was negative, which argues against this diagnosis, but because carbohydrate breath tests have variable sensitiv- ity and specificity, this finding does not rule out small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth.\n\nIntolerance of Cow\u2019s Milk\nCow\u2019s milk intolerance is common among in- fants and young children. It causes diarrhea and can be associated with eczema. Cow\u2019s milk in- tolerance usually resolves with age, whereas this patient\u2019s symptoms persisted into adulthood. In addition, skin-prick testing with cow\u2019s milk anti- gen was negative, and symptoms persisted de- spite elimination of cow\u2019s milk from the diet.\n\nEosinophilic Gastroenteritis\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis is most prevalent among children younger than 5 years of age and is often associated with a coexisting atopic con- dition. Because there is usually an underlying allergic component, eosinophilia and an elevated blood IgE level can be present. The blood IgE level was sometimes elevated in this patient, and the absence of eosinophilia could be explained by ongoing treatment with glucocorticoids. How- ever, there was no evidence of tissue involvement with eosinophilic infiltration in the mucosa or muscularis layers on multiple biopsies of the small intestine.\n\nEnteropathy Associated with Angiotensin- Receptor Blockers\nSprue-like enteropathy has been reported in pa- tients taking the angiotensin II\u2013receptor blocker olmesartan. There have been very few case re- ports of this condition occurring with the use of losartan,6 which was the angiotensin II\u2013recep- tor blocker that this patient was taking. This patient\u2019s symptoms predated his use of losartan, so this medication is unlikely to be the cause of his symptoms; however, a brief trial involving discontinuation of this medication would be appropriate.\n\nInborn Errors of Immunity\nInborn errors of immunity, also known as pri- mary immunodeficiencies, are disorders that stem from defects in immune regulation or tol- erance and can mimic inflammatory bowel dis- ease. Many of these conditions can be fatal  early in life. The most common primary immu- nodeficiency \u2014 common variable immune defi- ciency \u2014 can be ruled out in this patient, given the absence of immunoglobulin deficiencies. Two additional primary immunodeficiencies mer- it consideration in this patient: autoimmune poly- endocrinopathy, candidiasis, and ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) and immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome.\n\nAPECED\nAPECED, also known as autoimmune polyendo- crine syndrome type 1 (APS-1), results from a defect in the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE) that leads to a loss of central immune tolerance.7 Patients with APECED present with mucocutane- ous candidiasis, ectodermal dystrophy, and mul- tiple endocrine diseases. Hypoparathyroidism and adrenal insufficiency are the most common endocrine diseases; diabetes mellitus or hypo- thyroidism (or both) can also occur. APECED is often associated with underlying autoimmune enteropathy, and gastrointestinal manifestations can vary widely. However, this patient did not have any of the typical endocrine diseases asso- ciated with APECED or have mucocutaneous candidiasis.\n\nIPEX Syndrome\nIPEX syndrome is an immune dysregulatory dis- order that typically develops in infancy. It is due to a defect in the gene encoding forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) that leads to dysfunctional regulatory T cells.8 Patients with IPEX syndrome present with a classic triad of manifestations: autoimmune endocrinopathies (typically neonatal type 1 diabetes mellitus and thyroiditis), auto- immune enteropathy (associated with failure to thrive and severe chronic diarrhea), and eczema- tous dermatitis. Hemolytic anemia and nephritis, which were seen in this patient, have been described in patients with IPEX syndrome. Intes- tinal biopsy typically reveals features consistent with autoimmune enteropathy: villous atrophy, intraepithelial lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment. However, immunosuppression typi- cally controls symptoms only transiently, with- out long-term remission, which is consistent with this patient\u2019s disease course.\nGiven this patient\u2019s history, clinical presenta- tion, and constellation of symptoms, I suspected that IPEX syndrome was the most likely diagno- sis. To establish this diagnosis, I referred the patient to the allergy and clinical immunology unit for further evaluation and consideration for genetic testing.\nDisease-causing variants have been described in the coding regions and in the noncoding re- gions of FOXP3; no clear genotype\u2013phenotype correlations have been identified.16,19-22 Of note, FOXP3 variants have variable penetrance, with the same variant causing different clinical pre- sentations across carriers, including family members.20\nThis patient\u2019s clinical presentation was con- sistent with IPEX syndrome, and genetic testing showed a variant of uncertain significance in FOXP3: FOXP3, exon 8, c.754A\u2192G (p.Lys252Glu).\nThis sequence change replaced lysine with glu- tamic acid at codon 252 of the protein FOXP3. The lysine residue is moderately conserved, and there is a small physicochemical difference be- tween lysine and glutamic acid. This mutation is in the leucine-zipper domain (Fig. 3), which mediates homodimerization and heterodimer- ization.24 This variant is not present in popula- tion databases (no frequency in the Genome Aggregation Database [gnomAD]). The Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) prediction25 for this variant was \u201cdeleterious,\u201d  and the Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen-2) prediction26 was \u201cprobably damaging.\u201d\nThe next step was to perform functional studies on regulatory T cells from the patient. Results of phenotyping of regulatory T cells, performed at the Medical College of Wisconsin by means of surface-marker flow cytometric analysis, were abnormal. There was an elevated total percentage of FOXP3+ CD4+ T cells in cir- culation, and these cells had atypical expression of CD25 and CTLA4. In healthy persons, regula- tory T cells constitutively express high levels of CD25 and CTLA4, because FOXP3 drives their expression. In this patient, many FOXP3+ regu- latory T cells had reduced expression of CTLA4 and CD25. Within the clinical spectrum of IPEX syndrome, a decrease in circulating FOXP3+ regulatory T cells is seen in persons with FOXP3 variants that result in loss of protein expres- sion.17 In contrast, persons with FOXP3 missense mutations may have regulatory T cells in which FOXP3 is present but partially functioning or nonfunctioning.16,18 This patient had a missense variant in which FOXP3 was present, but he appears to have had a hypomorphic variant that affected the function of FOXP3. Overall, the re- sults of flow cytometry in this patient were consistent with regulatory T-cell dysfunction and T-cell hyperactivation, findings that suggest a hypomorphic FOXP3 variant.\nIn this patient, the clinical history, the detec- tion of a FOXP3 variant that was also present in his mother (a finding consistent with X-linked inheritance), the abnormal results on phenotyp- ing of regulatory T cells by means of surface- marker flow cytometric analysis, and the demon- stration of an increase in effector and activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in circulation led to a diagnosis of IPEX syndrome.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Variant and Classification\nDr. Frances A. High: The patient underwent panel- based genetic testing, including sequencing as well as deletion and duplication analysis of 207 genes associated with primary immunodeficien- cies and monogenic inflammatory bowel dis- ease. This testing revealed three rare variants in three different genes: a hemizygous missense variant in FOXP3, a heterozygous promoter vari- ant in the gene encoding the RNA component of mitochondrial RNA\u2013processing endoribonuclease (RMRP), and a heterozygous splice-donor variant in the gene encoding SH3 domain\u2013binding pro- tein 2 (SH3BP2) (Table 2). The RMRP and SH3BP2 variants were not thought to be relevant because of the mismatch between the clinical phenotype of the patient and the reported disease associa- tions and inheritance patterns of the genes. However, FOXP3 is associated with the X-linked recessive disease IPEX syndrome, so the FOXP3 variant found in this patient warranted addi- tional investigation.\n \ncan College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology.9 On the basis of an evidence-based framework, each variant is given one of five classifications\n\u2014 pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain sig- nificance, likely benign, or benign \u2014 to help determine the likelihood that the variant will cause disease. Variants of uncertain significance are common findings on genetic testing that can be challenging to interpret. They cannot be used alone to establish a clinical diagnosis or to direct clinical management. Familial segrega- tion studies and functional studies on the gene product can aid in determining the clinical rel- evance of a variant of uncertain significance.\nFamilial  segregation  studies  for  the   FOXP3\nvariant were performed and showed that the variant was inherited from the patient\u2019s mother, who was a heterozygous carrier. The variant was absent in his father and unaffected brother. These findings are consistent with the X-linked recessive inheritance pattern of IPEX syndrome.\n\nIPEX Syndrome Manifestations and Effects on Regulatory T Cells\nDr. Barmettler: IPEX syndrome is caused by loss- of-function variants in FOXP3,10-12 which is a master transcriptional regulator that is funda- mental to the function of CD4+ CD25+ regula- tory T cells.13 Regulatory T cells suppress the activation and effector functions of self-reactive and potentially pathogenic lymphocytes.14 Loss- of-function variants in FOXP3 cause quantitative or functional deficiencies in regulatory T cells,which lead to immune dysregulation. This dys- regulation can manifest as autoimmune disease and allergic inflammation.10,12,15,16\nIn addition to the classic triad of manifesta- tions associated with IPEX syndrome (autoim- mune endocrinopathies, autoimmune enteropa- thy, and eczematous dermatitis), numerous other manifestations have been described, including neurologic abnormalities, hematologic disorders (e.g., immune-mediated cytopenias), pulmonary disease, hepatitis, renal disease, and infections (Fig. 2).17-20 Allergic inflammation can include eczema, food allergies, eosinophilia, and an ele- vated total IgE level.",
