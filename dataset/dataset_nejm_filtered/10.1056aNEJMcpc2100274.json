    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Arielle J. Medford: A 76-year-old woman with heart failure and type 2 diabetes mel- litus was admitted to this hospital with nausea, diarrhea, and acute kidney failure. The patient normally lived independently, but she had been staying in a skilled nursing facility for the past several weeks to recover from a recent humeral frac- ture. During her stay, nausea, abdominal cramps, and nonbloody diarrhea devel- oped. The next day, the symptoms persisted, and she was transferred to the\nemergency department of this hospital.\nApproximately 3 months before the current admission, the patient was admit- ted to this hospital with respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of heart failure and pneumonia. She was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline for 5 days, and diuretic agents were adjusted during a 3-week hospitalization. Nine weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s condition returned to baseline, and she was discharged home with instructions to continue a diuretic regimen of torsemide and spironolactone. The patient\u2019s dry weight was 127 kg. Laboratory test results at the time of discharge are shown in Table 1.\nFour weeks before the current admission, the patient lost her balance while walking and fell onto her right side. She had no loss of consciousness, chest pain, or other symptoms. She was evaluated in the emergency department of this hos- pital and reported pain in her right arm. On examination, there were abrasions and bruising over the right elbow, with tenderness on palpation; the weight was 123 kg. The right radial pulse was normal, and sensation was intact in the arm and hand. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the right arm showed a mild transcondylar fracture of the right distal humerus. A splint was placed, and the patient was advised not to bear weight with the right arm. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility for increased support with daily ac- tivities while she was recovering.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, while the patient was staying in the skilled nursing facility, edema developed in both legs, and her weight increased by 5 kg. She attributed the weight gain to increased salt intake. Nine days before the current admission, oral metolazone was added to her diuretic regimen, and the leg edema resolved.\nAt the time of the current admission, the patient reported nausea and abdominal cramps. She reported no fever, chills, cough, dyspnea, dysuria, flank pain, or vomiting. She had no known sick contacts. Her medical history in- cluded hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obstructive sleep apnea, for which nightly treatment with continuous positive airway pressure had been prescribed. Medications included allopurinol, amiodarone, aspirin, atorvastatin, cyclobenzap- rine, enoxaparin, fluticasone, glipizide, loratadine, lorazepam, metformin, metolazone, metoprolol, sertraline, spironolactone, torsemide, warfarin, and zolpidem. The last doses of metolazone, spironolactone, and torsemide were taken more than 24 hours before admission. There were no known drug allergies. Before the recent humeral fracture, the patient had been living alone in an urban area of New England; she required assis- tance from home health services for bathing and chores and used a walker for ambulation. She did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. She had no recent history of travel, and her family history was unremarkable.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well,\nwithout respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 137/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 126 kg. The oral mucous mem- branes were dry. The heart sounds were normal, as were the breath sounds throughout both lung fields. There was no edema in the lower legs. The right arm was in a splint.\nThe blood level of creatinine was 7.66 mg per deciliter (677 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range,\n0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the level of lactic acid was 7.4 mmol per liter (67 mg per deciliter; reference range,\n0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deci- liter]). Urinalysis by dipstick showed a pH of 5.0 (reference range, 5.0 to 9.0) and a specific grav- ity of 1.012 (reference range, 1.001 to 1.035), and no protein, blood, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, glucose, or ketones were present. Additional labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nChest radiography revealed mild pulmonary interstitial edema. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and urinary tract revealed simple cysts in the left kidney, with no evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Oladapo O. Yeku: This 76-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, coronary artery disease, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction presents for eval- uation of nausea, abdominal cramps, and non- bloody diarrhea. The first step in developing a differential diagnosis in this case is to recon- struct the series of events that may have led to the patient\u2019s presentation with these symptoms.\n\nRecent Medical Events\nThis patient was admitted to the hospital approx- imately 3 months before the current admission for management of congestive heart failure. She was discharged home with a diuretic regimen of torsemide and spironolactone; her dry weight at that time was 127 kg. Four weeks before the current admission, she was admitted again, after a fall, at which time her weight was noted to be approximately 4 kg less than her dry weight; the blood urea nitrogen level and the results of liver- function tests were elevated as compared with those obtained during her previous admission. After discharge, therapy with an additional di- uretic, metolazone, was started for the treatment of leg edema.\nWith this background in mind, we can now consider the patient\u2019s current presentation of nausea and diarrhea in the context of acute renal failure. On admission to the hospital, it is im- mediately notable that the blood levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine are profoundly elevated.\n\nAcute Renal Failure\nWhat is causing this patient\u2019s acute renal failure? The various causes of renal failure are typically grouped into three diagnostic categories: prerenal causes, intrinsic renal disease, and postrenal causes (Table 2). Postrenal causes of kidney in- jury are generally less common in women than in men for anatomical reasons, and the findings from this patient\u2019s renal ultrasonography ruled out bilateral hydronephrosis and nephrolithiasis. On the basis of this framework, we are left to consider whether this patient\u2019s acute renal fail- ure is due to a prerenal cause or to the develop- ment of intrinsic renal disease.\n\nPrerenal Causes of Renal Failure\nFor my initial summary statement, I would de- scribe this patient as a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and congestive heart failure who presents for evaluation of nausea, abdominal cramps, and nonbloody diarrhea and is being admitted to this hospital with prerenal acute kidney injury in the context of increased diuretic use. This framing makes sense on the basis of her presentation and the finding of an elevated creatinine level, but nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are not consistent with a diuretic- induced prerenal kidney injury. In addition, the ratio of urea nitrogen to creatinine is less than 20, the urine sodium level is greater than 20 mmol per liter, and the fractional excretion of sodium is greater than 1%. The fractional excretion of sodium is calculated rather than the fractional excretion of urea, since the patient discontinued diuretic use more than 24 hours before her pre- sentation. Overall, these findings are inconsis- tent with a prerenal cause of acute kidney injury and are more suggestive of intrinsic renal injury (Table 2).\nIntrinsic Renal Disease\nThe causes of intrinsic renal disease can be grouped into the following categories: glomeru- lar diseases, acute tubular necrosis, and acute interstitial nephritis. However, this patient\u2019s age, the time course of renal injury, the normal physi- cal examination, and the absence of red cells in the urine and of eosinophilia are not consistent with glomerular disease or with allergic, autoim- mune, infectious, or infiltrative acute interstitial nephritis. Therefore, I would refine my summa- ry statement to indicate that this is a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and conges- tive heart failure who presents for evaluation of nausea, abdominal cramps, and nonbloody diar- rhea and has been found to have acute tubular necrosis in the context of aggressive diuresis.\nReconciliation of Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Acute Tubular Necrosis\nAlthough I believe we are getting closer to the ultimate diagnosis, I am still left to explain this patient\u2019s gastrointestinal symptoms, which do not fit with the diagnosis of acute tubular necro- sis. In this case, I would assess the gastrointes- tinal symptoms and acute tubular necrosis sepa- rately and see whether there are other diagnoses that could fit both.\nStarting with acute tubular necrosis, my work- ing hypothesis is that the acute renal failure is a result of excessive diuretic use. The physical find- ings of dry mucous membranes and the lower weight measurement that fell below her estab- lished dry weight support overdiuresis. This pa- tient may have a suppressed tachycardic response owing to the use of metoprolol, or her current heart rate might be tachycardic as compared with baseline. Renal infarction could be consid- ered, but to have the degree of renal dysfunction that this patient has, the infarction would prob- ably need to be bilateral, and she does not have any flank pain. Nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, and pyelonephritis are also similarly unlikely on the basis of the physical examination, radio- graphic findings, and laboratory test results.\nOne aspect of the patient\u2019s presentation that\nhas not been reconciled is her acid\u2013base status. She has metabolic acidosis, and the anion gap is 29 mmol per liter \u2014 findings that are consistent with anion-gap metabolic acidosis. The lactic acid level is markedly elevated, which makes lactic acidosis the likely cause of the anion-gap meta- bolic acidosis. Winters\u2019 formula is a calculation used to predict the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (Paco2) resulting from respiratory compensation in the context of metabolic acidosis. On the basis of Winters\u2019 formula (Paco2 = 1.5 \u00d7[HCO3\u2212]+ 8), this patient\u2019s compen- sated Paco2 should be 41 mm Hg. This is much lower than the measured Paco2   of 57 mm Hg,\nwhich is consistent with concurrent respiratory acidosis. Could the concurrent respiratory acido- sis be due to her chronic carbon dioxide reten- tion from obstructive sleep apnea, or could it be a warning of impending hypercapnic respiratory failure?\nTo determine whether the patient has a mixed acid\u2013base disorder, we need to determine the delta\u2013delta, which is the ratio of the change in anion gap to the change in bicarbonate level. This delta\u2013delta ([anion gap \u2013 12]\u00f7[24 \u2013 HCO3\u2212]) can reveal the presence of concurrent metabolic acidosis or alkalosis. This patient\u2019s delta\u2013delta is greater than 2 (actual value, 9.3), which suggests concurrent metabolic alkalosis. The presence of metabolic alkalosis is probably due to decreased renal clearance or to contraction alkalosis result- ing from diuretic therapy. A review of the labora- tory test results shows that the bicarbonate level has been gradually increasing, lending weight to the presence of gradual contraction alkalosis. I would further refine my summary statement to indicate that this is a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and congestive heart failure who presents for evaluation of nausea, abdomi- nal cramps, and nonbloody diarrhea and has been found to have lactic acidosis and acute tubular necrosis in the context of overdiuresis.\nIf my clinical hypothesis of acute tubular necrosis and lactic acidosis is correct, then I should be able to explain what happened to this patient. For this, I return to her medical history. The timeline of escalating diuretic therapy leading to prolonged renal hypoperfusion and acute tubu- lar necrosis makes sense. She was treated with a cephalosporin \u2014 ceftriaxone \u2014 which has been reported to cause renal injury.1,2 However, ceftri- axone was administered at least 9 weeks before this admission, which makes it an unlikely ex- planation for the acute kidney injury. If a new medication was not a contributor, what about her previous medications? It is not clear whether repeat laboratory tests were performed or wheth- er any adjustments were made to the medications that this patient was taking at home while the diuretics were escalated. Do any of her medica- tions require adjustment for changes in renal function or are any associated with a known risk of toxic effects that could cause acute tubular necrosis or lactic acidosis? Aspirin, allopurinol, enoxaparin, glipizide, loratadine, and metformin all meet at least one of these criteria. Of these medications, metformin stands out immediately as the likely reason for her lactic acidosis (Fig. 1). Lactic acidosis due to toxic effects from metformin use is a more likely explanation for the cause of the patient\u2019s nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea than the concurrent devel- opment of viral gastroenteritis. Unlike type A lactic acidosis, which is characterized by hypo- perfusion, type B lactic acidosis due to metformin use results from increased production of lactic acid and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis.3 The timeline of the patient\u2019s renal dysfunction preceding the gastrointestinal symptoms is con- sistent with the occurrence of toxic effects from metformin use.\nI would propose my final summary statement to describe this patient as a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and congestive heart failure who presents for evaluation of nausea, abdominal cramps, and nonbloody diarrhea and has been found to have acute tubular necrosis in the context of overdiuresis, as well as mixed anion-gap metabolic acidosis driven by lactic acidosis, which is consistent with toxic effects from metformin use. Measurement of the metfor- min level in the blood could verify this hypoth- esis, but this is rarely necessary, and I would not wait for confirmation of the metformin level to initiate treatment.\nMetformin is generally thought to be safe and effective for the management of type 2 diabetes. Although the use of metformin is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 30 ml per minute per\n1.73 m2 of body-surface area, it is also generally not recommended in patients with an eGFR be- tween 30 and 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. In patients currently receiving therapy, the risks and benefits of continuing therapy need to be evalu- ated if the eGFR drops below 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m2. The cautious continued use of met- formin in patients who have been receiving ther- apy and have an eGFR between 30 and 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 or have other risks has been advocated in part because the incidence of lactic acidosis in this population is not substantially greater than the incidence among patients with type 2 diabetes who have sufficient renal function.4 Furthermore, some reports suggest that the mor- tality associated with lactic acidosis due to metformin use has generally been decreasing over\ntime.5 However, it is important to reconcile these guidelines with the individual patient, and I would be reluctant to use metformin in a patient simi- lar to this patient, given the risk of sudden chang- es in creatinine clearance. Ultimately, the difference between a drug and a poison is the dose.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sacha N. Uljon: Therapeutic drug monitoring allows clinicians to adjust a dose so that the plasma drug level remains within a specific thera- peutic window. Such monitoring maximizes the effectiveness of the drug while reducing the risk of toxic effects.\nThe plasma metformin level was measured at a reference laboratory by means of high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spec- trometry. The level of detection for the assay is\n0.1\tmg per liter. The patient\u2019s plasma metformin level on hospital day 2 was 16 mg per liter. This markedly high metformin level, together with the patient\u2019s lactic acidosis, is consistent with a diag- nosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.\nAlthough metformin has been in use for more than half a century, dose\u2013response trials evalu- ating plasma levels of metformin are lacking, and therefore, a therapeutic range has not been determined. A literature review in 2016 identi- fied 65 different levels or ranges for \u201ctherapeu- tic\u201d plasma metformin; the lowest and highest levels cited were 0 and 1800 mg per liter, respec- tively, with the majority falling between 0.1 and 4 mg per liter.6 Metformin-associated lactic aci- dosis has been reported in patients who had \u201ctherapeutic\u201d metformin levels, although the co- existing conditions that these patients had make it difficult to establish metformin alone as the cause of their lactic acidosis.7 The reference labo- ratory reports the therapeutic range as being approximately 1 to 2 mg per liter, with lactic acido- sis generally occurring at levels exceeding 5 mg per liter (unpublished data).\n",
