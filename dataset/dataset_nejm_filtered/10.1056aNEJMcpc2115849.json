    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jessica L. Logeman (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of a mediastinal mass that was identified as part of an evaluation for waxing and waning fevers, night sweats, and fatigue.\nThe patient had been well until 3 months before admission to this hospital, when fatigue and a transient pruritic maculopapular rash on the forearm devel- oped. During the next 6 weeks, the forearm rash resolved but fatigue persisted. The patient began to take naps during the daytime and was unable to put in full days at his job in construction work. He also began to have night sweats and fevers with temperatures of up to 37.8\u00b0C.\nTwenty-seven days before admission to this hospital, the patient found that he was unable to work because of fatigue, and he sought evaluation in the emergency department of another hospital. Blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative, but screening and confirmatory tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive. A diagnosis of Lyme disease was made, and treatment with doxycycline was initiated. Because gastrointestinal upset developed, doxycycline was discontinued and amoxicillin was prescribed for the remainder of the 14-day course. Sixteen days before admission to this hospital, the patient began to have chest discomfort, which he described as a sensation of a \u201csoftball\u201d in his left lower chest. The chest discomfort limited his ability to breathe, and his primary care physician referred him to the emergency department of the other hospital. On evaluation, he reported increasing fatigue and malaise, night sweats, and fevers, along with diffuse arthralgias and myalgias, headache, photophobia with some visual flashes, dyspnea on exertion, edema, a pruritic erythematous rash on his chest, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and distention, and\nwatery diarrhea that occurred three times per day.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/84 mm Hg, the heart rate 61 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the pa- tient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 83.9 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. There was a faint diffuse erythematous macular rash on the anterior portion of the chest.\nThe abdomen was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Blood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and lipase were normal; other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for microbiologic culture. An electro- cardiogram was normal. Intravenous normal saline and oral acetaminophen were administered, as was empirical treatment with intravenous piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, hydromorphone, and ondansetron. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: Fifteen days before admis- sion to this hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a bi- lobed heterogeneous soft-tissue mass, measuring\n6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, in the anterior mediastinum. There were multiple enlarged subcarinal and mediastinal lymph nodes (measuring up to 15 mm in short-axis diameter), multiple enlarged mes- enteric lymph nodes (measuring up to 11 mm in short-axis diameter), mesenteric fat stranding, and trace ascites.\nDr. Logeman: Abdominal discomfort persisted; piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was discontinued and ceftriaxone was prescribed. Two days later, CT of the abdomen, performed without the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new pulmonary edema, new small bilateral pleu- ral effusions, and an increased volume of ascites. The patient was transferred to a second hospital for further evaluation.\nPhysical examination was notable for mild abdominal tenderness and distention, as well as leg edema. Blood levels of alanine aminotrans- ferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and bilirubin and a urinalysis were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. 18F-fluorodeoxy- glucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emission tomography (PET) (Fig. 1D) revealed indeterminate low-level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal soft tis- sue, as well as in pleural effusions and medias- tinal lymph nodes.\nDuring the next week, dyspnea and abdomi- nal pain persisted. Edema increased, specifically in the abdomen, legs, and face; the weight in- creased to 93.0 kg. Intravenous ceftriaxone and metoclopramide and oral hydromorphone, ondan- setron, and lactulose were administered. Addi- tional laboratory tests were performed (Table 2). On the eighth day at the second hospital, video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. The mediastinum reportedly appeared inflamed. The patient underwent an evacuation of pleural fluid and a biopsy of mediastinal soft tissue and lymph nodes primarily in the subcarinal window (level VII). On pathological examination of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue showed fibroconnective and adipose tissue with fibrosis, mild inflammation and fat necrosis, prominent capillary proliferation, and congestion; the lymph nodes were reportedly \u201cmildly abnor- mal.\u201d Microbiologic evaluation of the biopsy specimens revealed occasional leukocytes but no acid-fast bacilli or fungal elements. On flow cytom- etry of the biopsy specimens, the mediastinal soft tissue did not show any abnormal cell popu- lations; the lymph nodes contained polyclonal B-cell and heterogeneous T-cell populations, without immunophenotypic evidence of lym- phoma. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the biopsy specimens were negative. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid re- vealed reactive mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes but no malignant cells.\nAfter the procedure, the creatinine level increased to 2.93 mg per deciliter (reference range,\n0.50\tto 1.30). Examination of urinary sediment revealed hyaline and granular casts. Intravenous furosemide was administered. On the 15th day at the second hospital, the patient was trans- ferred to this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient reported persistent fa- tigue, mild dyspnea, abdominal distention, edema, and anorexia. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and the chest rash had resolved. Fevers and night sweats had occurred in a waxing and waning pattern during the previous weeks. He reported intermittent photophobia and headache, without neck stiffness or phonophobia, and had no other neurologic symptoms.\nThe patient had no history of illness and had not received routine medical care as an adult. He took ibuprofen and acetaminophen as needed and had no known allergies to medications. He had been exposed to dust through his job in construction work. He lived with his wife, child, and pet dog and cat in a coastal wooded com- munity in New England. He frequently spent time outdoors, either working or playing golf, and had received multiple tick bites. He had trav- eled to the Mediterranean and Oceania regions in previous years and, more recently, to the southwestern United States. The patient had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and drank beer rarely. His father had had prostate cancer and colon cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 148/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.7 kg. Neurologic examination was normal, and there was no nuchal rigidity. There were inspiratory crackles in the left lung. The abdomen  was mildly distended and diffusely tender. Mild fluctuance was noted on the right side of the chest, at the site of the surgical inci- sion. There was no palpable cervical, supracla- vicular, submandibular, submental, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs.\nBlood levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspar- tate aminotransferase, bilirubin, ceruloplasmin, fibrinogen, folate, globulin, haptoglobin, and vitamin B12 were normal; other laboratory test\nresults are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed cloudy yellow urine with 2+ protein and 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). An electrocardiogram was normal.\nDr. Goiffon: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1E), performed after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm, which was slightly smaller than it had been on the previous chest CT. There were en- larged perivascular, paratracheal, subcarinal, and aortopulmonary mediastinal lymph nodes (mea- suring up to 12 mm in short-axis diameter) with heterogeneous enhancement. Increased pulmo- nary edema, moderate bilateral pleural effusions, moderate-volume ascites, mild splenomegaly, and multiple subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes were detected.\nDr. Logeman: On the third hospital day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head re- vealed no abnormalities. On the fourth day, a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. Intra- venous furosemide and oral acetaminophen were administered. Lumbar puncture was performed, and 26 ml of colorless fluid was removed; open- ing pressure was not measured. Results of cere- brospinal fluid analysis are shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. On the fifth day, renal ultrasonography revealed kidneys of normal size with normal parenchyma and no hydronephrosis. Diagnostic paracentesis was per- formed; results of ascitic f luid analysis are shown in Table S1.\nDr. Goiffon: On the 13th day, MRI of the chest was started but could not be completed because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. Sequences that were ob- tained before termination of the study (Fig. 1F) showed an anterior mediastinal soft-tissue mass with hypointensity on steady-state gradient echo imaging; the mass was smaller than it had been on chest CT performed before transfer to this hospital. In addition, there were enlarged medi- astinal lymph nodes, large bilateral pleural effu- sions, ascites, and a hematoma at the site of the surgical incision.\n\nTable 1.

Imaging Studies.\nFifteen days before admission to this hospital, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed at the first hospital. A coronal image (Panel A) shows splenomeg\u2011 aly (spleen length, 14 cm; normal value, \u226412) and non\u2011 focal fat stranding and trace ascites (asterisks) along the right sigmoid mesentery and left anterior renal fas\u2011 cia. Transaxial and coronal images (Panels B and C, re\u2011 spectively) show a bilobed anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 2.8 cm, with soft\u2011tissue attenua\u2011 tion (arrows) and enlarged lymph nodes (arrowheads). Nine days before admission to this hospital, 18F\u2011fluoro\u2011 deoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron\u2011emission tomography (PET) was performed at the second hospital. A thick\u2011 slab, sagittal maximum intensity projection of attenua\u2011 tion\u2011corrected PET images (Panel D) shows low\u2011level FDG uptake in the anterior mediastinal mass (arrow) and an enlarged left cervical lymph node (arrowhead). On the first day at this hospital, dual\u2011energy contrast\u2011 enhanced CT was performed. A transaxial iodine map (Panel E) shows minimal enhancement of the anterior mediastinal mass, measuring 6.1 cm by 1.9 cm (arrow), as compared with the enhancement of prominent me\u2011 diastinal lymph nodes (arrowheads). On the 13th day at this hospital, MRI was started but could not be com\u2011 pleted because the patient had respiratory distress when placed in the prone position. A transaxial fast imaging employing steady\u2011state acquisition (FIESTA) image (Panel F) shows interdigitated fat and hypointense soft tissue, as compared with muscle, in the anterior medi\u2011 astinum (arrows). The respiratory distress was caused by large bilateral pleural effusions (asterisks).\n\nTable 2.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. David C. Fajgenbaum: This previously healthy 55-year-old man presented with an anterior mediastinal mass, mediastinal lymphadenopa- thy with low FDG uptake, prominent mesenteric lymph nodes, and splenomegaly in the presence of constitutional symptoms, anasarca, elevated levels of inflammatory markers, renal dysfunc- tion, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and thrombo- cytopenia. His inflammatory syndrome could be consistent with a cytokine storm, which is char- acterized by elevated levels of circulating cyto- kines, acute systemic inflammatory symptoms, and organ dysfunction due to an excessive im- mune response.1 With a cytokine storm, rapid identification of the underlying cause and initia- tion of the appropriate treatment are critical. The elevated levels of inflammatory markers \u2014 including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, and interleu- kin-6 \u2014 are nonspecific findings. However, the development of this inflammatory syndrome, along with a mediastinal mass and lymphade- nopathy, in an immunocompetent patient helps to narrow the differential diagnosis to cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and other immune-related causes.\nCancer\nThe constellation of a mediastinal mass, lymph- adenopathy, splenomegaly, and constitutional symptoms is most concerning for lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, as well as thymoma and other solid tumors with a predi- lection for the mediastinum. We were told that the excised lymph nodes had been characterized as \u201cmildly abnormal\u201d on pathological examina- tion, but we did not receive a detailed descrip- tion of the findings. However, there was no mention of morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of Reed\u2013Sternberg cells or other clonal populations. In addition, pathological examina- tion of the mediastinal mass did not reveal morphologic evidence of thymoma or other solid tumors. The low FDG uptake also suggests that cancer is unlikely in this case. However, biopsy sampling errors can cause false negative results, particularly in patients with Hodgkin\u2019s lympho- ma, in whom clonal Reed\u2013Sternberg cells are very rare and nearby reactive lymph nodes may be inadvertently sampled.2 Given that histologic examination of an adequate tissue specimen is the cornerstone of cancer diagnosis, we would need to reexamine this patient\u2019s biopsy speci- mens to determine whether they are sufficient or a repeat excisional biopsy is necessary. \nInfectious Diseases\nSeveral infectious diseases can cause a systemic inflammatory syndrome, but the presence of lymphadenopathy and a mediastinal mass nar- rows the list of possibilities. Many infectious diseases \u2014 including bacterial infections (e.g., infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other mycobacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi or other patho- gens transmitted by ticks, Bartonella henselae, Treponema pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, or leptospira), viral infections (e.g., infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficien- cy virus [HIV], or hepatitis B virus), and other infections (e.g., toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, coccidioidomycosis, or malaria)\n\u2014 are unlikely, given the negative microbiologic tests, the clinical presentation, and the lack of a response to empirical antibiotic treatment. Although tests for Lyme disease IgM and IgG were positive, Lyme disease is very unlikely to be the underlying cause of this patient\u2019s syndrome, given the fact that he did not have characteristic features of the disease, as well as the lack of a response to weeks of antibiotic treatment. It is important to note that tests for Lyme disease IgM may remain positive for years after infection.3,4\n\nAutoimmune Diseases\nAutoimmune diseases \u2014 such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, vasculitis, myasthenia gravis, Good- pasture\u2019s disease, and rheumatic fever \u2014 can be ruled out by the presenting symptoms and the negative tests for antinuclear antibodies and other markers. The patient\u2019s myalgias and arthralgias probably reflect nonspecific inflamma- tion. Although lupus is associated with a range of symptoms and signs that overlap with features of this case, the negative test for antinuclear antibodies and the absence of hypocomplement- emia provide a high negative predictive value, allowing us to rule out lupus in this case.\n\nOther Immune-Related Causes\nOther immune-related illnesses \u2014 such as sar- coidosis, IgG4-related disease, amyloidosis, and IgG2-subclass deficiency \u2014 are unlikely diagno- ses in this case, given the imaging, biopsy, and laboratory findings. Inherited immunodeficien- cies and autoinflammatory conditions would not typically manifest at 55 years of age. Sarcoidosis is a serious consideration in this patient, but the absence of granulomas in excised tissue makes this diagnosis unlikely. However, it is important to ensure that the biopsy specimens are suffi- cient to rule out this diagnosis, as well as can- cer. Although this patient\u2019s low levels of IgG and the IgG2 subclass might signal an IgG2-subclass deficiency, he did not have a history of infection, and the absence of such a history suggests that these laboratory findings are not clinically sig- nificant.7 Two other immune-related diseases remain in the differential diagnosis.\n\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\nThe constellation of fevers, splenomegaly, cyto- penias, and elevated levels of inflammatory mark- ers is characteristic of hemophagocytic lympho- histiocytosis (HLH), which comprises a group of rare disorders of immune hyperactivation trig- gered by infection, cancer, or autoimmune dis- eases. However, this patient had a normal fi- brinogen level and a ferritin level of less than 1000 \u03bcg per liter, which would be uncommon in a patient with HLH.8 Lymphadenopathy and a mediastinal mass would also be unusual in a pa- tient with HLH, unless the HLH is being triggered by lymphoma or infection, which is unlikely in this case. Nevertheless, it would be helpful to assess the morphologic features in bone marrow, natural-killer-cell activity, and levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor.9 Evidence of hemophago- cytosis in bone marrow and decreased natural- killer-cell activity would support a diagnosis of HLH; a mildly elevated level of soluble interleu- kin-2 receptor, which reflects T-cell activation, is highly sensitive but less specific for HLH.\nCastleman\u2019s Disease\nCastleman\u2019s disease describes a group of rare and heterogeneous polyclonal lymphoproliferative dis- orders that are associated with a spectrum of characteristic histopathological features. These features are often classified as hypervascular or hyaline vascular, plasmacytic, or mixed. This pa- tient\u2019s syndrome is highly consistent with multi- centric Castleman\u2019s disease (MCD), which involves multicentric lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, cytopenias, anasarca, and organ dys- function due to a cytokine storm, often driven by interleukin-6. MCD can result from uncontrolled\n \nhuman herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection in persons with HIV infection or an immunocompromised state (HHV-8\u2013associated MCD), can be due to cy- tokine production by monoclonal plasma cells (POEMS [polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endo- crinopathy, M protein, and skin changes]\u2013asso- ciated MCD), or can have an unknown or uncer- tain cause (idiopathic MCD [iMCD]).11 Given that this patient is presumed to be immunocompetent and there is no evidence of monoclonal plasma cells, HHV-8\u2013associated MCD and POEMS-asso- ciated MCD are unlikely; however, the excised lymph node tissue should be tested for HHV-8.\nThis patient meets all consensus diagnostic criteria for iMCD except for the histologic fea- tures in lymph node tissue, so a second review of the specimen is warranted.12 He has multicen- tric lymphadenopathy, as well as the following 8 of 11 minor criteria (with diagnosis requiring\n\u22652): an elevated C-reactive protein level, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, renal dys- function, constitutional symptoms, splenomega- ly, and fluid accumulation. In addition, diseases that mimic iMCD have been ruled out. Although nondiagnostic, the elevated interleukin-6 level and the small-volume lymphadenopathy with low FDG uptake are also consistent with iMCD. Furthermore, this patient has features of a severe clinical subtype of iMCD called TAFRO, which is characterized by thrombocytopenia (T), anasarca (A), fever or an elevated C-reactive pro- tein level or both (F), renal insufficiency or reticu- lin fibrosis or both (R), and organomegaly (O).13 Although not required for diagnosis, megakaryo- cytic hyperplasia in bone marrow, myelofibrosis, hyaline-vascular or hypervascular features in lymph node tissue, an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, low or normal levels of gamma globulins, and a mediastinal mass are often present in pa- tients with iMCD\u2013TAFRO. Patients with iMCD who do not meet the criteria for the TAFRO sub- type \u2014 who are often described as having iMCD, not otherwise specified (iMCD\u2013NOS) \u2014 tend to have thrombocytosis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and plasmacytic features in lymph node tissue. Although this patient\u2019s clinical presentation is highly consistent with iMCD\u2013TAFRO, a full review of the lymph node tissue is required to deter- mine whether the histopathological findings support a diagnosis of iMCD and, if so, to deter- mine which histopathological variant is present. With regard to the diagnosis of mediastinal tumors, a Case Record published in the Journal in 1964 noted that \u201c\u2018any diagnosis short of a histologic one in this area is at best an educated guess\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019m not sure what it is at the worst.\u201d14 When lymphadenopathy and progressive sys- temic symptoms are also present, a critical his- topathological review of adequate, representative\ntissue is essential.\n",
