    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. J. Sawalla Guseh: A 38-year-old man was evaluated at the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of exertional chest discomfort.\nThe patient had been a competitive athlete in the past and had remained an avid runner. Approximately 15 years before the current evaluation, while he was run- ning, he had episodes of flushing with diffuse cutaneous swelling involving the face, lips, hands, and trunk, along with hives on the abdomen and legs and as- sociated dyspnea. The first episode occurred in autumn and the second episode the following summer. After the second episode, he lost consciousness while sit- ting on a bench. The next day, he was evaluated at an urgent care center. A Holter monitor was placed, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was reportedly normal. The patient consulted with an allergist, who made a diagnosis of food- related exercise-induced anaphylaxis with reactions to soybeans, chickpeas, and tahini, on the basis of the foods he had eaten before these episodes and the results of radioallergosorbent testing. An epinephrine autoinjector was prescribed for use during future episodes, but the anaphylaxis symptoms did not recur.\nApproximately 4 months before the current evaluation, during a routine 5-mile jog, the patient had a new sensation that he described as \u201cmy heart beating out of my chest.\u201d He rested, and the symptom subsided; he completed his run. One month later, during a bicycle ride, he had \u201ccrampy\u201d discomfort in the anterior chest, which abated when he stopped cycling. Two weeks before the current evalu- ation, during a jog of several miles, he had cramping pain in the anterior chest on the left side that gradually escalated over a 5-minute period. He started walking, and the pain abated; he ran for an additional 20 minutes without a recurrence of pain. He sought an evaluation in the cardiology clinic of this hospital to determine the cause of his symptoms and the safety of continued vigorous exercise.\nOn evaluation in the cardiology clinic, a review of systems was negative for dyspnea, recent syncope, orthopnea, edema, cough, hemoptysis, and recent aller- gic symptoms. The patient ran or cycled four times per week and had previously completed a marathon. His medical history in- cluded attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Five years earlier, an episode of syncope had occurred in the context of multiple episodes of nonbloody diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and chills. His surgical history included two colonic polypectomies, one 6 years before this evalua- tion and the other 1 month before this evalua- tion; pathological examination of the polyps had revealed lymphoid aggregates and hyperplastic polyps. The patient took no medications and reported no adverse reactions to medications.The patient worked in the financial  sector and lived with his wife and children. He did not use tobacco, alcohol, or other substances. Mul- tiple maternal relatives had had colon cancer, and an older brother had had colonic polyps re- moved in his fourth decade of life. There was a family history of hypertension.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 122/84 mm Hg (measured in both arms), the heart rate 54 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There were mild expiratory wheezes; the remainder of the examination was normal.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities, findings that had been observed on tracings ob- tained 5 years earlier during an evaluation for presyncope; a TTE obtained at that time had been normal. Sinus bradycardia and anterior T-wave abnormalities had not been observed on tracings obtained 15 years earlier (Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C). The white-cell count and platelet count were normal, as were blood levels of hemoglo- bin, electrolytes, calcium, and thyrotropin and results of renal-function tests. The high-sensitiv- ity troponin level was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14). Plasma metanephrines were un- detectable, and the normetanephrine level was normal. The next day, a TTE showed no abnor- malities of cardiac chamber size and function and no evidence of valvular dysfunction.\nAn ambulatory patch heart monitor, applied to evaluate cardiac rhythm over a 2-week period, revealed sinus rhythm without arrhythmia. A cardiopulmonary exercise stress test was per- formed; the patient exercised for 19 minutes 17 seconds according to a treadmill protocol that increased incrementally to maximal effort with  a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.12 and a maxi- mum heart rate of 181 beats per minute (99% of the age-predicted maximum). At peak effort, the stress test did not reproduce symptoms, and he stopped because of leg fatigue. An ECG showed 0.5-mm horizontal ST-segment depression in leads III, aVF, V3, and V6, along with isolated premature ventricular contractions. The ventilatory efficiency was normal.\n\nCoronary CT angiography, per- formed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evi- dence of an anomalous coronary-artery origin or atherosclerotic plaque. However, a 5-cm intra- pericardial mass was detected anterior to the heart and within the aortopulmonary groove. The mass showed intense heterogeneous en- hancement and had an attenuation level of 50 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material, 218 HU during the arterial phase, and 111 HU during the delayed phase (Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C). The proximal right coro- nary artery was encased by the mass (Fig. 2D).\nA volume-rendered image showed multiple tiny feeding vessels leading to the mass that were arising from the proximal right coronary artery and from the middle-to-distal left anterior descending coronary artery. There was also nar- rowing of the middle left anterior descending coronary artery, a finding consistent with the steal phenomenon. The steal phenomenon oc- curs because coronary arteries are supplying the mass, and in the presence of coronary-artery stenosis, periods of vasodilation (which can oc- cur during exercise) can lead to diversion (\u201csteal\u201d) of blood flow to the mass, rather than through the coronary vessels. There was prominent ve- nous drainage of the mass (Fig. 2E, and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The structure anterior to the aorta that had been observed on TTE (Fig. 1F) was probably a collateral vessel that was supplying the mass. \nTo narrow the differential diagnosis, 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine single-photon-emission CT was performed (Fig. 2F). The study showed mod- erate tracer uptake that corresponded to the mass observed on coronary CT angiography. The finding was nonspecific and could not defini- tively differentiate between paraganglioma and hemangioma. Next, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a heterogeneous mass that was isointense on T1-weighted images and was hy- perintense with hypointense internal foci, which resulted in a \u201csalt and pepper\u201d appearance, on T2-weighted images. After the administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material, the mass showed intense and early enhancement on first-pass perfusion images, a finding that indicated high vascularity (Fig. 3A, 3B, and 3C).\n\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "paraganglioma;hemangioma.",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Guseh: I participated in the care of this pa- tient, and I am aware of the final diagnosis. This 38-year-old man, who was physically active and fit, presented with episodic exertional chest dis- comfort that had occurred spontaneously through- out several months. The discomfort increased with exertion and decreased with rest; it typically developed soon after he started exercising and resolved when he continued exercising after a period of rest. This patient\u2019s presenting symp- toms were classic for and consistent with a sta- ble anginal syndrome.\nBefore assuming that this fit 38-year-old man had a primary cardiac disease, we considered entities outside the heart that can cause exertional chest discomfort, including costochondritis and rib fracture. However, careful physical examina- tion of each rib revealed no abnormalities. Next, we considered disorders within the heart, including exercise-induced arrhythmia (supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia), myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy (e.g., hypertrophic or arrhythmo- genic cardiomyopathy). However, normal results on ambulatory patch heart monitoring, structurally normal findings on TTE, and supranormal fitness without arrhythmia on maximal effort during cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing made these diagnoses unlikely.\nBecause the patient had an anginal syndrome that was worse with exertion and better with rest, we continued to have a high index of suspicion for a coronary abnormality. The chronic nature of the symptoms made an acute coronary syn- drome unlikely. Moreover, traditional atheroscle- rotic coronary artery disease would be unusual in a relatively young and highly active athletic man with no atherosclerotic risk factors or family history. The patient did not have a family history of hyperlipidemia, and he had previously had a normal lipid profile.\nTherefore, in addition to premature coronary artery disease, key diagnoses to rule out in this patient included a congenital anomalous coro- nary artery, coronary spasm with or without myocardial bridging, and a compressing medias- tinal mass. Angina is also common in patients with pulmonary hypertension, but this possibil- ity was deemphasized because the patient had no evidence of dilatation or dysfunction on the right side of the heart on TTE and had a normal ventilatory efficiency on cardiopulmonary exer- cise stress testing.\nThe pattern of chest discomfort developing with initial exercise and resolving with resumed exercise was consistent with a phenomenon known as warm-up angina. Warm-up angina is defined as angina that is present on initial exer- tion but is absent on, and not reproduced by, a similar second exertion; it is often explained by the recruitment of coronary collateral f low or microvascular recruitment during initial exer- cise.1,2 Given the exertional pain and the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors, a syndrome with coronary involvement, such as a congenital anomalous coronary artery, was a leading con- sideration in this patient.\n\nCongenital Anomalous Coronary Artery\nThe precise prevalence of coronary-artery anom- alies is unknown but is estimated to be approximately 1% or less in the general population.3 The majority of deaths associated with coronary- artery anomalies are thought to occur with exer- cise.4 In athletes, coronary-artery anomalies may manifest as syncope, presyncope, or at times, angina. Acute angulation of an aberrant coro- nary origin, dynamic compression by adjacent structures, and presumed obstructive ischemia are some proposed mechanisms of angina and sudden cardiac death that occur in the context  of exercise.5\nIn a large autopsy study involving military recruits, 1 in 3 cases of sudden death that oc- curred in this athletic population were found  to be caused by coronary-artery anomalies.6 The right coronary artery normally arises from the right sinus of Valsalva of the aortic root,  and the left coronary artery arises from the left sinus of Valsalva. In this study, most cases of sudden death were associated with the left coro- nary artery arising from the right sinus of Val- salva and then coursing between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Other features that confer  a high risk of coronary-artery anomalies have been noted.7\nCoronary-artery anomalies can be detected by means of TTE of the coronary origins. However, coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiogra- phy has become increasingly available and is the test of choice in adult populations.\n\nFlushing Syndromes\nFinally, we considered whether this patient\u2019s quiescent history of exercise-induced anaphy- laxis and flushing might be associated with his clinical presentation. We considered systemic diseases, such as carcinoid syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and pheochromocytoma, which can all cause flushing and angioedema with exer- cise. However, these are uncommon diagnoses. There was no evidence of carcinoid syndrome on TTE, and the plasma free metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were normal.\nWe thoroughly reviewed this patient\u2019s TTE. Although the study showed normal coronary origins, an anterior vascular echolucent space was identified (Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F). We per- formed coronary CT angiography to define the patient\u2019s coronary anatomy and rule out coronary-artery anomalies.\n",

Coronary CT Angiogram and 123I-MIBG SPECT Image.\nAn axial CT image obtained during the arterial phase (Panel A) shows an intrapericardial mass (arrow), anterior to the heart and within the aortopulmonary groove, with heterogeneous enhancement and an attenuation level of 218 Hounsfield units (HU). The attenuation level of the mass is 50 HU on an image obtained before the administration of contrast material (Panel B, arrow) and 111 HU on an im- age obtained during the delayed phase (Panel C, arrow). A sagittal CT image (Panel D) shows that the proximal right coronary artery is encased by the mass (arrow). A volume-rendered image (Panel E) shows the relationship of the mass (in purple) with the chambers on the right side (in blue) and on the left side (in red) and with the coronary arteries; there is evidence of narrowing of the left anterior de- scending coronary artery (black arrow), prominent venous drainage (white arrow), and feeding vessels arising from the right coronary artery (arrowheads). An axial image from 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) single-photon-emission CT (SPECT) (Panel F) shows moderate tracer uptake in the mass (arrow).\n",
