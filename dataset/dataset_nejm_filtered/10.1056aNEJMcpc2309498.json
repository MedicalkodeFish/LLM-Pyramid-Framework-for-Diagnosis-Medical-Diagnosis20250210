    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Ben Ouyang (Medicine): A 21-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the summer because of pancytopenia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of good health until 4 weeks before the current presentation, when nausea and vomiting developed. The nausea and vom- iting resolved after 1 day, but fatigue developed. Two weeks before the current presentation, lightheadedness associated with changing positions developed, as well as night sweats; fatigue persisted. On the morning of the current presenta- tion, the patient had lightheadedness while lying down, and he presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient reported ongoing lightheadedness. The temporal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/68 mm Hg, the pulse 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 91.2 kg, the height 192 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.7. The conjunctivae were pale. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia and an elevated blood bilirubin level. The blood lactate dehydroge- nase level was greater than 2500 U per liter (reference range, 135 to 225). Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, d-dimer, and fibrinogen were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nChest radiography reportedly showed no abnormalities. Intravenous fluids were\nadministered, and the pulse decreased to 100 beats per minute. Oral doxycycline was administered for possible tickborne illness. One unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported that the lightheadedness had abated. He had no history of fever, hematuria, blood in the stool, or bleeding from other sites. He worked as a carpenter and spent minimal time outside. He lived with his parents and brother and had two cats and a dog. He took no medications. There were no known drug allergies. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His maternal grandmother had had lymphoma.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/64 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The results of pulmonary, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations were normal. Areas of hypopigmentation of the skin were detected near the elbows, fingers, and feet. Cranial nerve function was intact, and strength was 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs.\nDr. Maria Y. Chen: Examination of a peripheral- blood smear (Fig. 1) revealed evidence of mac- rocytic anemia with anisopoikilocytosis. Few white cells were present. There were neutrophils with variable segmentation and occasional im- mature forms, as well as platelets that were normal in terms of number and morphologic features.Dr. Ouyang: A direct antiglobulin test was negative for IgG; C3 was detected on micro- scopic examination. Screening tests for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA were negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobi- linogen (reference value, negative), without bili- rubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine M. Sertic: A sagittal ultrasound image of the abdomen (Fig. 2) showed mild splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 15.8 cm on the long axis (reference value with adjust- ment for sex and height, <14.1). There was an incidental rounded echogenic lesion in the left hepatic lobe that measured up to 1.3 cm in diameter, a finding consistent with a hepatic hemangioma.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Jonathan C.T. Carlson: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final di- agnosis in this case. This 21-year-old man pre- sented with fatigue and night sweats, and pancytopenia was detected. These nonspecific symptoms and signs invoke a broad differential diagnosis, which can be narrowed when we con- sider that he had been previously healthy, with no known tick or toxin exposures, and that his illness had developed over the course of weeks, not months or years.\nWe could generate a differential diagnosis around these features alone. However, they can be juxtaposed with a constellation of striking laboratory abnormalities, including pronounced leukopenia, symptomatic macrocytic anemia, and a markedly elevated blood lactate dehydro- genase level. It can be particularly useful to consider the \u201cscaling functions\u201d of these labora- tory test results \u2014 that is, their relative magni- tude, including where exactly they land within or outside the normal range, and more important, how they scale in proportion to each other and to the severity of illness. The interpretation of laboratory test results in pathologic or physio- logical clusters often reveals characteristic pat- terns that can unravel a case (Fig. 3). Analyzing the lactate dehydrogenase level in the context of the bilirubin level and reticulocyte count will help us test hypotheses about the scale and sites of cellular injury. In addition, measuring the reticulocyte count alongside the mean corpuscu- lar volume, red-cell distribution width, and fer- ritin level will provide a nuanced view of nutri- tional status.\nThe interpretation of such multidimensional\nhematologic data is a task in which basic science has thus far outstripped our clinical approach. High-dimensional RNA sequencing and f low cytometry, for example, are routinely analyzed with clustering algorithms that help us both decode and visualize key cellular relationships1,2.\n\u2014 a practice that portends a future in which clinical laboratory tests are used to compute a probabilistic differential diagnosis. Until such methods are developed, we will need to leverage a version of this approach that is grounded in clinical experience. For each of the categories of causes of pancytopenia that are described below, consideration of the scaling functions for key hematologic measures will help us adjudicate the relative likelihood and potential mecha- nisms.\n\nCongenital Diseases\nGiven this patient\u2019s young age, the adult onset of a pediatric syndrome that causes pancytopenia must be considered. An entity such as GATA2 de- ficiency, Fanconi\u2019s anemia, the Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome, or a ribosomopathy or telomeropathy could cause pancytopenia, and an elevation in the mean corpuscular volume would occur with some of these disorders. However, few aspects of the patient\u2019s history would provide further support for such a process; he had no recurrent infections, developmental abnormalities, or other chronic organ dysfunction. The tempo of symp- tom onset, over a period of 4 weeks, would be too fast for these entities, and the blood lactate dehydrogenase level of nearly 3000 U per liter would be uncharacteristically high in the absence of a hematologic cancer.\n \n\n \t    Infections\nIn contrast, the subacute onset of illness, the history of nausea and vomiting early in the presentation, and the good health at baseline are all consistent with an infectious cause of the patient\u2019s pancytopenia. Infection with a viral pathogen such as cytomegalovirus or Epstein\u2013 Barr virus could also account for his spleno- megaly. An atypical presentation of infection with parvovirus or adenovirus should also be considered. The laboratory scaling functions, however, substantially decrease the likelihood of these viral infections. None of these infections are likely to result in a blood lactate dehydroge- nase level of nearly 3000 U per liter. In addition, a hemoglobin level of 5.1 g per deciliter would be very low, and a mean corpuscular volume of\n105.9 fl would be atypically high. A viral infection associated with bone marrow suppression would not typically induce macrocytosis or an elevated red-cell distribution width. Parvovirus- induced pure red-cell aplasia can cause profound anemia, but the reticulocyte count is usually undetectable. This patient\u2019s reticulocyte count of 3.8% will require further interpretation but does not fit that pattern.\nWhat about infection with nonviral patho- gens? The indolent course of illness in an other- wise healthy patient is not consistent with bacte- remia or sepsis. An atypical mycobacterial or fungal infection is unlikely in the absence of other evidence of immunodeficiency and without suspicious imaging findings. Although the pa- tient presented in the summer, tickborne illness is also improbable; screening tests for Lyme disease were negative, and he had no known exposures or environmental risk factors. Babe- siosis with erythrocyte destruction is highly un- likely to be the cause of a blood lactate dehydro- genase level of nearly 3000 U per liter in the absence of marked hyperbilirubinemia, other signs of tissue injury, and critical illness.\nIt would be reasonable to perform nucleic acid testing for Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomega- lovirus, and parvovirus. However, my overall suspicion for an infectious process is low in this case.\n\nCancer\nThe subacute onset of illness in this patient is compatible with a diagnosis of a hematologic cancer, and night sweats are often associated with cancer, particularly lymphomas. The strik- ingly abnormal lactate dehydrogenase level, hemo- globin level, and white-cell count are concordant with cancer as a potential cause of his pancyto- penia. However, other laboratory test results are more reassuring. The reticulocyte and platelet counts were relatively preserved; these findings suggest that the bone marrow has not been completely infiltrated by tumor and that marrow production has not been interrupted at a systemic level. Likewise, no clear population of circulat- ing immature cells was seen on a peripheral- blood smear, and the mean corpuscular volume of 105.9 fl would be atypical for any of the hema- tologic cancers. In addition, no lymphadenopathy was detected on examination. Nevertheless, leu- kemia or lymphoma remains a possibility, and given the risk of missing such a diagnosis, it would be reasonable to perform a bone marrow biopsy.\nInflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases\nThis patient\u2019s constellation of night sweats, fa- tigue, and pancytopenia could be explained by an autoimmune disease, and examination find- ings consistent with vitiligo further suggest an autoimmune process. Systemic lupus erythema- tosus could account for several of this patient\u2019s laboratory abnormalities but is unlikely in the absence of other evidence of a connective-tissue disorder. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\n \ncan cause extreme elevation in the blood lactate dehydrogenase level, severe cytopenias, and var- ied clinical symptoms. However, normothermia and a normal (or not elevated) blood ferritin level would be highly unusual in a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and mac- rocytosis would be atypical.\nCould the patient have immune-mediated hemolysis? Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin- uria can be ruled out on the basis of the labora- tory scaling functions. In order for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria to account for the degree of elevation in the blood lactate dehydro- genase level seen in this patient, exceptionally brisk intravascular hemolysis would need to be present. In turn, the brisk intravascular hemoly- sis would be expected to cause clinically signifi- cant kidney injury, which would be inconsistent with the normal creatinine level and urinalysis results.\nCould the patient have antibody-mediated\nhemolysis? He had the classic quartet of find- ings: a positive direct antiglobulin test, an ele- vated lactate dehydrogenase level, an elevated indirect bilirubin level, and a low haptoglobin level. The quantitative pattern, however, does not fit with this mechanism. The blood lactate dehydrogenase level is atypically high; a level of less than 1000 U per liter would be typical. In addition, the reticulocyte count is discordantly low, given that f lorid red-cell destruction (i.e., red-cell destruction occurring at a rate compat- ible with the degree of anemia and elevation in the lactate dehydrogenase level in this patient) characteristically provokes a vigorous marrow response. The same argument applies to the bilirubin level, which is proportionate to the amount of hemoglobin being recycled and would have to be higher for the pathophysiological ki- netics \u2014 the rates at which pathophysiological events, such as red-cell destruction, and compen- satory physiological processes, such as clearance of metabolites, are proceeding \u2014 to align. Because the direct antiglobulin test was only positive mi- croscopically, a clinically significant autoimmune hemolytic process is unlikely.\nNutritional Deficiencies\nIn a patient with a normal diet and no alcohol consumption, there might at first be little concern regarding nutritional deficiencies. Yet, a closer look is warranted in this case because several aspects of the patient\u2019s presentation could be associated with vitamin deficiency. In the con- text of severe vitamin B12  or folate deficiency, ineffective hematopoiesis can lead to the death of precursor cells in bone marrow and to marked elevation in the lactate dehydrogenase level. Because some of the precursor cells in bone mar- row that die are developing erythrocytes, a low haptoglobin level may occur. Incorporating the degree of anemia in this patient, we can calcu- late a corrected reticulocyte count of 1.3%, which is much lower than the count that would be expected with the peak response by healthy and nutritionally replete bone marrow to such a severely depressed hemoglobin level.3 In addi- tion, an association is well established between vitiligo and pernicious anemia.4 Pernicious ane- mia wields a unique mechanism as a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency that is capable of exhausting nutrient stores even in the context of robust vitamin B12 intake; macrocytic anemia and an elevated red-cell distribution width are classic findings.\nAlthough this patient\u2019s neurologic status ap- peared to be normal, the hematologic and neuropsychiatric manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency are substantially independent, each mediated by mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated. The onset of clinical symptoms over a period of weeks to months would not fit the un- derlying biochemical progression of vitamin B12\ndeficiency, in which the depletion of physiologi-\ncal stores occurs over a period of 2 to 5 years.5 However, a clinical deficiency can be a thresh- old phenomenon, in which symptoms occur abruptly when compensatory mechanisms are exhausted. Given this possibility, the constella- tion of laboratory test results obtained thus far would support a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.\nThe critical next steps in this patient\u2019s evalua- tion included obtaining blood levels of vitamin B12 and folate, as well as performing a detailed review of the peripheral-blood smear, with a focus on the segmentation of neutrophils and the morphologic features of erythrocytes. Although vitamin B12  deficiency was a compelling potential explanation for his presentation, cancer remained a possibility, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Chen: The vitamin B12 level was less than 150 pg per milliliter (111 pmol per liter; reference value,\n>231 pg per milliliter [170 pmol per liter]). The folate level was 4.9 ng per milliliter (11.1 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.7 ng per milliliter [10.7 nmol per liter]). The methylmalonic acid level was elevated (1.00 nmol per milliliter; refer- ence value, <0.40), as was the homocysteine level (21.5 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0 to 14.2).\nThe peripheral-blood smear showed features consistent with megaloblastic anemia, including clinically significant anisopoikilocytosis and morphologically abnormal neutrophils. Neutro- phils have an average of three nuclear lobes, with a typical range of two to five. The presence of six or more lobes in more than 1% of neutro- phils, or the presence of five or more lobes in more than 5% of neutrophils, is consistent with hypersegmentation. In this patient, a large por- tion of neutrophils had five or more nuclear lobes.\nThe bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Fig. 4A)\nshowed normocellularity for the patient\u2019s age. Left-shifted erythroid hyperplasia and maturing trilineage hematopoiesis were detected. On E- cadherin staining (Fig. 4B), there was striking hyperplasia of early erythroid precursor cells. On CD34 staining (Fig. 4C), the level of CD34+ blasts was not increased, accounting for less than 5% of the overall cellularity in the bone marrow. Aspirate smears (Fig. 4D and 4E) showed erythroid cells with megaloblastic changes, in- cluding nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic asynchrony, nuclear budding, binucleation, and other nuclear irregu- larities. There were scattered giant band forms. Nuclear hypersegmentation was seen in a few megakaryocytes. Flow cytometry performed on the bone marrow showed no evidence of acute leukemia or other hematopoietic neoplasms. Cytogenetic testing showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY) in 20 metaphases, and no al- terations in genes that are commonly implicated in hematopoietic cancers were detected on a DNA-based next-generation sequencing panel (Rapid Heme Panel, version 3).6 The findings of ery- throid hyperplasia with prominent dyserythro- poiesis and mild morphologic abnormalities in the myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.\nAdditional serologic testing revealed the presence of both anti\u2013parietal cell antibodies and anti\u2013intrinsic factor antibodies, a combination of findings that has a high sensitivity and spec- ificity for the diagnosis of pernicious anemia.7,8 The serum gastrin level was elevated (594 pg per milliliter; reference value, <100), and the serum pepsinogen level was below the limit of quanti- fication; these findings are suggestive of atro- phic gastritis.9 Taken together, the laboratory and histopathological findings are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency due to pernicious anemia.\nDr. Ouyang: After the results of vitamin B12 testing were received, a more detailed neuro- logic examination was performed. Tone and cerebellar function were normal. Proprioception and vibration sense were intact, as were sensa- tion to light touch and pinprick. Temperature sensation was impaired in the feet and legs. Deep-tendon reflexes were 3+ at the patellae but were 2+ elsewhere.\n\nFigure 4. Bone Marrow\u2013Biopsy Specimen and Bone Marrow Aspirate.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Panel A) shows approximately 80% cellularity, which reflects nor\u2011 mocellularity for the patient\u2019s age. The myeloid\u2011to\u2011erythroid ratio is reversed, with an increase in erythroid forms. Mature segmented granulocytes are decreased but present. Megakaryocytes with overall normal morphologic features are also present. There is an abun\u2011 dance of left\u2011shifted forms, many of which are erythroid precursor cells. Immunohistochemical staining for E\u2011cadherin (Panel B) is positive in the erythroid precursor cells. Immunohistochemical staining for CD34 (Panel C) is positive in less than 5% of the cells overall, which does not indicate an increased level. Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of bone marrow aspirate smears (Panels D and E) shows an increase in erythroid cells with megaloblastic changes, including nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic asynchrony, binucleation, nuclear budding, and other irregularities (arrowheads). There are also scattered giant band forms (Panel D, arrow).\n\n",
