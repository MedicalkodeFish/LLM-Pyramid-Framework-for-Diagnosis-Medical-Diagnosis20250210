    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Peiyun Ni (Medicine): A 63-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital be- cause of fever, headache, sore throat, and confusion.\nThe patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fever, chills, myalgias, and headache developed. She also had sore throat, odynophagia, and the feeling of a \u201clump\u201d in the neck. The patient was concerned that she had coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and sought evaluation at an urgent care clinic of another hospital. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative, and she was instructed to quarantine at home.\nFive days before this admission, the patient returned to the clinic of the other hospital because of persistent symptoms, including daily fevers. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of another nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, as was testing of an oropharyngeal swab for the rapid detection of streptococcal antigen.\nOn the day of admission, the patient\u2019s sister visited the patient and noticed that she had difficulty with word finding and performing basic tasks at home. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fevers, chills, myalgias, fatigue, generalized weakness, headaches, sore throat, and odynophagia. She acknowledged that she had mild confusion and \u201cmental slowness\u201d of 2 weeks\u2019 duration. A review of sys- tems was notable for a lump in the neck, poor appetite, unintentional weight loss of 3 kg in the past 2 weeks, and anosmia for the past year, with onset before the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. There was no neck stiffness, photophobia, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria.\nThe patient had hypertension for which she took amlodipine and lisinopril; there were no known drug allergies. She was born in South America and had immigrated to the United States two decades ear- lier. She lived in an urban area of New England with her mother and son. Her son had a brain injury and was seen by visiting nurses daily; one nurse had had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test 4 days before this evaluation. There were no other sick contacts. The patient worked in management and enjoyed gardening as a hobby. She had no recent insect bites or travel. Although she had not been sexually active for several years, she had had an episode of unprotected sexual inter- course with a new male partner 3 weeks before this evaluation. She smoked four cigarettes daily and had done so for 40 years. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had Alz- heimer\u2019s disease.\nThe temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pres- sure  160/80  mm  Hg,  the  pulse  96  beats  per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.9. The patient appeared fatigued and was alert and ori- ented. She was unable to perform simple calcu- lations, to list the days of the week in reverse order, or to follow two-step commands. The mucous membranes were dry, and a small non- tender lymph node was palpable in the posterior neck on the left side. The white-cell count was 3700 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); the aspartate aminotransferase level was 280 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32) and the alanine aminotransferase level 235 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis re- vealed the presence of ketones, nitrites, and protein; there were fewer than 10 white cells per high-power field (reference range, <10). Testing of a third nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and blood specimens were obtained for culture.\nDr. William A. Mehan: A radiograph of the chest was normal. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge. Computed tomogra- phy (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the intravenous administration of contrast material, showed prominent gastrohepatic, periportal, peri- aortic, and inguinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.4 cm in diameter.\nCT of the head, performed without the intra- venous administration of contrast material, showed mild scattered hypodensities in the peri- ventricular and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres. Magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the intravenous administration of contrast material, was notable for multifocal patchy hyper- intensities throughout the juxtacortical and deep white matter of the cerebral hemispheres on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with- out corresponding restricted diffusion or abnormal enhancement (Fig. 1). The findings were un- changed from MRI findings obtained 3 months before presentation.\nDr. Ni: Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nA lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was 24 cm of water; the cerebrospi- nal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 201 mg per\t  deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55) and the glu-\ncose level 43 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 73 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 65% were lymphocytes, 29% plasma cells, and 6% monocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. The intra- venous administration of ceftriaxone and acyclo- vir was stopped.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Robert H. Goldstein: This 63-year-old woman presented with a progressive syndrome consist- ing of fever, headache, sore throat, and confu- sion \u2014 symptoms that are common in many diseases. My differential diagnosis and clinical reasoning will be guided by the subjective his- tory and the objective data provided in the case presentation. Subjective history includes infor- mation reported by the patient, her family, and others who directly observed the syndrome and relevant behaviors, as well as environmental and epidemiologic risk factors. On the basis of the subjective history, we can create a compre- hensive differential diagnosis. Objective data include measurable, quantifiable, and observable information, specifically the findings on physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and imaging studies. By combining the subjective history with the objective data, we can form a well-reasoned interpretation of the case in order to arrive at the most likely diagnosis. This reasoned assessment will inform the diagnostic and treatment plan.\nSubjective History\nI will first focus on the subjective information provided in the patient\u2019s history. She had fever,headache, and confusion that resulted in diffi- culty with word finding. Our differential diag- nosis must include manifestations of central ner- vous system (CNS) infection, namely encephalitis and meningitis. Until provided with additional information that rules out CNS infection, we should consider viral causes of encephalitis, such as herpesviruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus and varicella\u2013zoster virus) and enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus).1 We should also consider com- mon bacterial causes of meningitis, such as Strep- tococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes.\nIn addition to symptoms associated with CNS\ninfection, the patient reported sore throat and odynophagia, features suggestive of viral or bac- terial pharyngitis, specifically streptococcal phar- yngitis. She also reported myalgias, anosmia (for 1 year), and weight loss with a poor appetite, findings suggestive of a systemic viral process, including SARS-CoV-2 infection.2 Most of these symptoms began abruptly and progressed over a period of 2 weeks, which is consistent with an acute infection or inoculation.\nWith respect to environmental and epidemio- logic risk factors, several potential clues are pro- vided in the history. The patient was living in New England and enjoyed gardening. Several mosquito-borne and tickborne illnesses endemic in New England are associated with encephalitis or meningitis, including Lyme meningoencepha- litis, eastern equine encephalitis, and encephali- tis due to West Nile virus or Powassan virus.3 The absence of a known insect or tick bite or rash does not reliably rule out these infections; many infected patients cannot recall a bite or rash. Because this patient was born in South America, we should also consider infections en- demic in some South American countries, includ- ing Mycobacterium tuberculosis meningitis and Taenia solium infection with CNS involvement (neuro- cysticercosis).4\nThis patient reported a history of unprotected\nsex with a new male partner 1 week before the onset of symptoms and 3 weeks before hospital admission. We must consider sexually transmit- ted infections, including acute human immuno- deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and infection with Treponema pallidum (syphilis). When acute HIV infection is included on the differential diagno- sis, it is important to consider concurrent oppor-\n \ntunistic infections. Patients with acute HIV in- fection often have a transient but clinically significant decrease in the CD4+ T-cell count, sometimes to a level of less than 200 per micro- liter, which can lead to complication by oppor- tunistic infections such as mucocutaneous candi- diasis, pneumocystis pneumonia, and reactivation of tuberculosis.5\n\nObjective Data\nHaving created a differential diagnosis, we can turn to the available objective data to narrow the list. We are provided with limited findings from the physical examination, including fever, poor concentration on targeted neurologic examina- tion, and cervical lymphadenopathy. It is impor- tant to remember the value of a physical exami- nation, which can help to distinguish between meningitis and encephalitis (according to the presence or absence of nuchal rigidity), to iden- tify opportunistic infections (such as mucocuta- neous disease), and to differentiate between a localized CNS process and a systemic illness.6\nGiven the limited physical examination findings, we must rely on results of laboratory and imaging studies to further narrow down the differential diagnosis. The patient had a negative test of an oropharyngeal swab for streptococcal antigen and three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, which help to rule out those infections. The ele- vated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels and the presence of lymphopenia suggest a systemic viral infection. The presence of diffuse lymphadenopathy on imaging supports a working diagnosis of sys- temic viral infection, and the findings on MRI of the head help to rule out neurocysticercosis. CSF analysis revealed a mildly elevated protein level, a slightly decreased glucose level, and lym- phocytic pleocytosis, with a normal opening pres- sure. These results are helpful in ruling out bacte- rial causes of meningitis, except for tuberculosis.\nThe objective laboratory data and the presence of lymphadenopathy broaden the differential di- agnosis to include additional systemic viral in- fections that can cause a mononucleosis-like syndrome. One consideration is acute infectious mononucleosis due to Epstein\u2013Barr virus, which is often transmitted in oral secretions. Affected adults present with fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis, occasionally with hepatitis and less often with encephalitis; lymphocytosis with atyp- ical lymphocytes, rather than lymphopenia, is often present.7 Other considerations include acute infections with cytomegalovirus, toxoplasma, hepatitis A, B, or C virus, and HIV.\n\nClinical Reasoning\nHaving used the objective data to focus the dif- ferential diagnosis, we must now turn to clinical reasoning, pulling in subjective findings to sup- port the final diagnosis. The differential diagno- sis includes viral encephalitis, tuberculous men- ingitis, and an acute systemic primary viral infection, such as acute HIV infection, with or without complication by an opportunistic infec- tion. The discontinuation of acyclovir and ceftri- axone, which are the first-line treatments for infections with herpesviruses and tick-associated spirochetes, respectively, allows us to rule out these diagnoses.\nAmong the remaining possibilities, acute HIV infection (with or without a concurrent opportu- nistic infection) is highest on my differential diagnosis. Although the majority of new diagno- ses of HIV infection in the United States are re- ported in cisgender men who have sex with men, 19% of new diagnoses of HIV infection in the United States in 2018 were reported in cisgender women, with nearly 85% of those attributed to heterosexual contact.8 New incident cases of HIV infection were seen in adults and seniors; 60% of all incident cases in cisgender women oc- curred in those older than 35 years of age.8\nThe timeline of this case, with an episode of unprotected sex 1 week before symptom onset and with progression of symptoms for 2 weeks, is compatible with acute HIV infection. Patients with acute HIV infection often present with a constellation of viral symptoms, including CNS involvement. Over half of patients present with headaches, and more than 1 in 10 patients have symptoms of encephalitis or meningitis.9 The presence of CNS manifestations does not have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute HIV infection (25%), but it does have specificity (82%), and acute encephalopathy has been rec- ognized as a symptom of HIV seroconversion since the early days of the HIV epidemic.5,10\nAs mentioned previously, acute HIV infection can result in a clinically significant decrease in the CD4+ T-cell count, which can lead to opportunistic infections. With the exception of tuber- culosis, an opportunistic infection with CNS involvement seems unlikely in this case without specific findings on brain imaging (which may suggest toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or lymphoma) and with- out specific findings on CSF analysis (e.g., in- creased intracranial pressure, which would be expected in CNS cryptococcal disease).\nIf the patient had acute HIV infection with a clinically significant decrease in the CD4+ T-cell count, tuberculous meningitis would be a con- sideration. She was born in South America, where exposure to M. tuberculosis may be common. In patients with acute tuberculous meningitis, CSF analysis would show neutrophilic pleocytosis, a substantially elevated protein level, and a low glucose level, with a mildly elevated opening pressure.11 In this patient, the results of CSF analysis \u2014 including lymphocytic pleocytosis, a mildly elevated protein level, and a mildly de- creased glucose level, with a normal opening pressure \u2014 are more consistent with an acute viral infection. Given these data, I will remove acute tuberculous meningitis from the differen- tial diagnosis.\nAcute systemic viral infections other than HIV infection \u2014 such as mononucleosis due to Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus, toxoplas- mosis, and viral hepatitis \u2014 are possible but un- likely diagnoses in this case. Although Epstein\u2013 Barr virus and cytomegalovirus can be transmitted in oral secretions during sexual contact, acute mononucleosis due to one of these viruses is more often associated with lymphocytosis than with lymphopenia.12 Since some patients with acute cytomegalovirus infection present with lymphopenia, this diagnosis is more difficult to rule out in this case; however, the prominent CNS manifestations make cytomegalovirus in- fection unlikely. The patient\u2019s history did not suggest a possible source of acute toxoplasmo- sis, such as consumption of undercooked food or unpasteurized milk or exposure to a cat litter box.13 Acute hepatitis A, B, or C can be transmit- ted during sexual contact, but patients with viral hepatitis typically present with jaundice (an ele- vated bilirubin level). In addition, the average incubation period for acute hepatitis A, B, and C is 28 days, 90 days, and 14 to 84 days, respec- tively.14 In this case, the onset of symptoms occurred 7 days after sexual contact, which more closely aligns with the incubation period for acute HIV infection.\nTo establish the diagnosis of acute HIV infec- tion, it is important to understand the temporal appearance of HIV-specific biomarkers (Fig. 2). The time between exposure to HIV and the de- velopment of viremia, called the eclipse period, usually lasts 7 to 10 days. During the eclipse period, no HIV diagnostic tests will be positive. Around 10 days after exposure, high-level vire- mia can be detected on an HIV nucleic acid assay and symptoms of acute infection typically de- velop, although a small group of patients remain asymptomatic. Approximately 1 week later (17 to 20 days after exposure), HIV p24 antigen can be detected on a standard HIV antigen and anti- body assay of the blood. Around 21 to 25 days after exposure, HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies can be detected. The time between the first detection of viremia on a nucleic acid assay and the first de- tection of HIV-specific antigen or antibodies (seroconversion) is called the window period.\nIn this case, because the potential exposure to HIV occurred 3 weeks before hospital admis- sion, the patient would be likely to have a detect- able HIV RNA viral load and detectable HIV p24 antigen and may have detectable HIV-1 or HIV-2 antibodies; approximately 30% of patients with acute HIV infection have evidence of an evolving antibody response.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Bailey Hutchison: An immunoassay for HIV-1 and HIV-2 was reactive (Table 2). The assay used in this case is designed to detect HIV-1 p24 core antigen and antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2. Re- activity implies possible HIV infection without indicating the amount or type of targets detect- ed in the sample or the HIV virus type (HIV-1 or HIV-2) that may be present.\nIn accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, a supplemental test should be performed to confirm the initial result. In this case, a lateral flow immunochro- matographic assay was performed and revealed the presence of an antibody to only a single anti- genic component of the HIV-2 envelope, glyco- protein 140 (gp140). No antibodies specific to HIV-1 antigens were detected. The detection of a single antibody is associated with imperfect specificity; at least two antibodies to either HIV-1 or HIV-2 antigens must be present for an assay to be deemed positive. Therefore, the supplemen- tal test in this case was negative for HIV-1 anti- bodies and indeterminate for HIV-2 antibodies.\nHIV-1 and HIV-2 have distinct but similar\nantigenic proteins. Because the proteins are similar, antibodies to HIV-1 antigens may show cross-reactivity to HIV-2 antigens (and vice versa), especially early in the course of infection, when the specificity of the humoral immune response to the virus is evolving. Indeterminate results on supplemental tests can also occur with late-stage acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and a waning anti-HIV immune response, with other infections that have cross-reactivity with HIV anti- bodies, with immunomodulating conditions, and with specimen contamination or testing error.\nIn this case, because there was substantial clinical suspicion for acute HIV-1 infection, a quantitative HIV-1 nucleic acid assay was per- formed. The HIV-1 RNA viral load was measured at 8,420,000 copies per milliliter of plasma, estab- lishing the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection. A repeat confirmatory assay performed 10 days after the initial workup showed reactivity for antibodies to four HIV-1 antigens, as well as persistence of the HIV-2\u2013specific anti-gp140 antibody, confirm- ing the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection.\nTo complete the assessment of the patient\u2019s disease status, flow cytometry was performed to assess the CD4+ T-cell count. The absolute CD4+ T-cell count was 446 per microliter (reference range, 348 to 1456), a level that is well above the threshold used to establish the diagnosis of AIDS (200 per microliter). However, the relative CD4+ T-cell count was 11.9% (based on a total lymphocyte count of 3745 per microliter), a level that falls below the AIDS threshold (14%).17 In patients with acute HIV infection, this profound decrease in the relative CD4+ T-cell count is transient and represents depletion of CD4+ T cells concurrent with expansion of cytotoxic cells that target virally infected cells.18\n\nTable 2.
