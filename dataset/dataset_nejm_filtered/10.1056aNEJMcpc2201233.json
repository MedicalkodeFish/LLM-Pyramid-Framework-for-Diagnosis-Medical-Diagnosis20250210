    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Shaan Khurshid: A 56-year-old man presented to this hospital in early autumn with a 1-month history of myalgias and fever.\nApproximately 4 weeks before the current presentation, the patient began to have generalized myalgias and arthralgias, which were worst in the shoulders, proximal arms, and upper back. He had fever with temperatures of up to 38.2\u00b0C, along with chills and diaphoresis. He took naproxen, and the next day, he pre- sented to an urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 175/95 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Symptoms abated after 3 days, but then fever with temperatures of up to 38.3\u00b0C and fatigue occurred. The patient stopped consuming alcohol.\nThree weeks later, the patient had episodes of mild dyspnea with \u201ccoughing fits\u201d and presented to a second urgent care clinic affiliated with this hospital. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 59 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/75 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Another test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative, and the results of urinalysis and chest radiography were normal.\nThe next day, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician at an- other hospital. He reported a 1-month history of \u201cstabbing\u201d back pain between his shoulders, which was worst at the end of the day and was not relieved with the use of naproxen or a heating pad. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 48 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was tenderness on palpation of the left thoracic paraspinal area, but the remainder of the physical examination was normal. Radiographic images of the thoracic spine were reportedly normal.\nLaboratory test results obtained at that time are shown in Table 1, alongside routine test results obtained 6 months earlier. The patient was referred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn the systems review, the patient reported that he had recently measured heart rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute on his home pulse oximeter; his baseline heart rate was 80 to 90 beats per minute. He also reported a history of dysuria that was attributed to chronic prostatitis, as well as pain in the left wrist and knee that was attrib- uted to gout. He reported no weight loss, sweats, palpitations, dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest discomfort, joint swelling or redness, rash, headache, focal neurologic symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rectal bleeding.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for sickle cell trait, hypertension with mild left ven- tricular hypertrophy, palpitations, unprovoked pulmonary embolism, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperuricemia, latent tuberculosis, malaria, chron- ic hepatitis B virus infection, Helicobacter pylori infection, colonic schistosomiasis, prostatism, and thrombocytopenia. His last dental proce- dure had taken place more than 2 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, metoprolol, and losartan, as well as sildenafil as needed. He had received two vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), with the second vaccine admin- istered 7 months before the current evaluation. There were no known adverse reactions to medication.\nThe patient grew up in equatorial Central Africa. He had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier and had not returned to Africa for more than 5 years. He was employed at a lo- cal university and occasionally had contact with college students. He lived with his family in a suburb of Boston. During the summer months, he had visited islands in Massachusetts and coastal wooded areas to hike, camp, and swim. The patient reported that he had encountered many ticks but had not received a tick bite. He had been scratched by cats; there were no other animal exposures. In the past, he had consumed two or three beers daily, but he had stopped all alcohol intake during the previous month. He had never used tobacco or illicit substances. His family history was notable for atherosclerotic coronary disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C,\nthe heart rate 46 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen satura- tion 100% while the patient was breathing ambi- ent air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 34.4. He appeared comfortable. Auscultation of the chest revealed a bradycardic heart rate. There was tenderness on palpation of the left infrascapular area. A prostate examina- tion revealed a nontender hemorrhoid. There was no rash or lymphadenopathy, and the remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of calcium, total protein, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were ob- tained. Electrocardiograms were notable for sinus rhythm with first-degree and second-degree (2:1) atrioventricular block with intermittent right bundle-branch block (Fig. 1A), alternating with sinus rhythm with third-degree (complete) atrio- ventricular block and junctional escape rhythm with intraventricular conduction delay (Fig. 1B). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdo- men, and pelvis, performed after the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material, was negative for pulmonary embolism.\nIntravenous ceftriaxone, naproxen, acetamin- ophen, and oxycodone were administered. The patient was evaluated by an electrophysiologist and admitted to the cardiology unit of this hos- pital. The next day, the heart rate remained at approximately 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. Oxycodone and topical lidocaine were administered.\nDr. Alex L. Huang: Transthoracic echocardiogra- phy (TTE) revealed normal biventricular systolic function, with no regional left ventricular wall- motion abnormalities. There was mild diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation (Fig. 1C), a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.1 There was no evidence of valvular vegetations.\nDr. Khurshid: The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin was 63 ng per liter. Urinalysis was negative, as were blood tests for Lyme disease antibodies, anti-rickettsia IgM, ehrlichia and ana- plasma DNA, human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, and babesia.\nOn the third hospital day, tests for SARS- CoV-2, Bartonella henselae and B. quintana antibod- ies, and anti-treponemal antibodies were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive.\nDr. Borek Foldyna: The patient underwent car- diac CT with electrocardiographic gating, includ- ing contrast-enhanced CT angiography and de- layed imaging. Epicardial fat and a thickened interatrial septum abutting the noncoronary si- nus of the aortic valve showed increased radioden- sity on delayed imaging (Fig. 2A and 2B); these findings are suggestive of inflammatory chang- es and may indicate evolving abscess. The tricus- pid aortic valve had mildly thickened leaflets, but there was no evidence of focal valvular veg- etations, thrombi, or calcifications.\nDr. Khurshid: Oral doxycycline was administered.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the ventricular rate measured between 30 and 40 beats per minute, and the maximum temperature was 37.9\u00b0C.\n\nTable 1.

Initial Cardiac Imaging Studies.    A 12\u2011lead electrocardiogram obtained shortly after pre\u2011 sentation to this hospital (Panel A) shows normal sinus rhythm with second\u2011degree (2:1) atrioventricular block.\nThe P waves are indicated by asterisks. The QRS com\u2011 plexes show variation; the fourth, fifth, and eighth com\u2011 plexes are conducted with a right bundle\u2011branch block aberrancy in a typical rSR\u2032 pattern in lead V1, which is\nindicated by arrows. A 12\u2011lead electrocardiogram ob\u2011\ntained approximately 20 minutes earlier (Panel B) shows normal sinus rhythm with third\u2011degree (complete) atrio\u2011 ventricular block. There is atrioventricular dissociation, which is defined as the absence of an apparent relation\u2011 ship between the P waves (asterisks) and the QRS com\u2011 plexes. The sinus rate of approximately 80 beats per minute is faster than the ventricular rate. The ventric\u2011 ular escape rhythm is junctional, as evidenced by the relatively narrow QRS complexes and an escape rate\nof approximately 50 beats per minute. A transthoracic echocardiogram in the parasternal long\u2011axis view with color Doppler (Panel C) shows mild diastolic mitral regur\u2011 gitation, a finding consistent with atrioventricular block.\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography (TEE) excluded infective endocarditis but revealed mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nBlood tests showed positive hepatitis B virus antibodies, but negative surface antigen and DNA. Tropheryma whipplei DNA was also negative. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated.\n\nThe patient developed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.\n\nCardiac MRI suggested edema of the central fibrous body, but no myocardial late gadolinium enhancement.\n\nThe heart rhythm converted to accelerated junctional rhythm. Various autoantibodies and SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests were negative.\n\nAntibodies or DNA tests for toxoplasma, borrelia, brucella, mycoplasma, microfilaria, Coxiella burnetii, and chlamydia were negative. Anti-double stranded DNA antibody titer was slightly above normal.\n\n18F-FDG PET showed increased uptake in the interatrial septum and anterior mediastinal lymph nodes.\n\nDespite treatment with ceftriaxone for several days, the patient's condition did not improve. Doxycycline was later added to cover potential pathogens not treated by ceftriaxone.\n\nCardiac imaging confirmed an infectious or inflammatory process in the atrioventricular node region, but no valvular vegetations, favoring regional myocarditis over infective endocarditis. The patient's symptoms, cardiac conduction abnormality, and myocardial injury on imaging were more consistent with regional myocarditis.\n\nApart from alcohol exposure, the patient had no epidemiological clues suggestive of toxin-related myocarditis. Drug-induced allergic myocarditis also did not fit the history. This narrowed the diagnosis to immune-related or infectious myocarditis.\n\nThe patient had no history of gastrointestinal disease or asthma, normal systemic examinations, no eosinophilia, normal thyroid and calcium metabolism, and negative urinalysis, renal function, chest X-ray, vasculitis and inflammatory arthritis markers. These made diagnoses like inflammatory bowel disease, hyperthyroidism, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polymyositis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and cardiac sarcoidosis unlikely. Considering epidemiological factors, Chagas disease, Kawasaki disease, and COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis were also unlikely. Giant cell myocarditis remained a possibility, but the patient lacked significant ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure.\n\nConsidering the patient's epidemiological exposures, special infectious causes needed to be considered, such as gram-negative bacteria, chlamydia, mycobacterium tuberculosis causing prostatitis; bartonella, aeromonas, listeria or pneumococcal infections in alcohol users; Whipple's disease; toxoplasmosis; listeria, borrelia, rickettsia, blastomyces, leptospira, aeromonas infections related to outdoor activities; and brucella, schistosoma, Q fever, filariasis, taenia solium in central Africa. Based on the previous infectious evaluation, mycobacterium tuberculosis, listeria, pneumococcus, blastomyces, leptospira and aeromonas infections still needed to be considered.\n\nAfter a week of observation, the patient's fever, back pain and CRP decreased significantly after adding doxycycline.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Paras: By the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s condition had not improved despite the admin- istration of ceftriaxone for several days, and oral doxycycline was added to cover potential patho- gens that were not treated by ceftriaxone. Subse- quent cardiac imaging confirmed the presence of an infectious or inflammatory process in the region of the atrioventricular node. However, there was no evidence of valvular vegetations, a finding that made infective endocarditis unlikely. The symptoms, cardiac conduction abnormality, and evidence of myocardial injury on imaging made regional myocarditis the most likely diag- nosis in this patient.\n \nToxin-Mediated Myocarditis\nAside from exposure to alcohol, this patient did not have any epidemiologic clues that would be suggestive of toxin-mediated myocarditis, and exposure to a toxin would typically not cause subacute fever. Although numerous medications can lead to an allergic reaction that causes myo- carditis, the patient had no history of an allergy or reported exposure to medication. These fac- tors narrow the differential diagnosis to myo- carditis caused by an immune-mediated or in- fectious process.\n\nImmune-Mediated Myocarditis\nThe patient reported no recent history of gastro- intestinal illness or asthma and had normal re- sults on mucocutaneous, skin, musculoskeletal, eye, and pulmonary examinations. He did not have eosinophilia and had normal levels of thy- rotropin and calcium. Furthermore, the results of urinalysis, renal-function tests, and chest ra- diography were normal, and serologic evaluation for markers of vasculitis and inflammatory ar- thritis was negative. This constellation of data makes inflammatory bowel disease, thyrotoxico- sis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangi- itis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, polymyo- sitis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and cardiac sarcoidosis all unlikely.3,4 Of note, the patient had no history of travel to Central America or South America, which makes Cha- gas\u2019 disease unlikely. His age is not consistent with a diagnosis of Kawasaki\u2019s disease. Although he had received Covid-19 vaccines, the 7-month interval is too long to be suggestive of vaccine- related myocarditis.3,11 Giant-cell myocarditis re- mains a possible diagnosis at this time; however, it typically involves clinically significant ventricu- lar tachyarrhythmias and heart failure, which were not features of this patient\u2019s presentation.3,4\nInfectious Myocarditis\nAlthough infectious myocarditis is most com- monly caused by a viral infection, it is important to consider epidemiologic clues derived from the patient\u2019s medical history. His history of chronic prostatitis suggests the possibility of a gram- negative bacterial infection or infection with\nC. trachomatis or M. tuberculosis, especially since he had a positive test for M. tuberculosis and was not treated for latent tuberculosis.3,4\nAlcohol use increases the risk of infection with bartonella species, aeromonas species, Lis- teria monocytogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae.3,4,7 The patient\u2019s age, sex, and history of arthralgias are consistent with the diagnosis of Whipple\u2019s disease, which is  caused by  infection  with\nT. whipplei.12 Exposure to cats suggests the possi- bility of toxocariasis or infection with B. henselae or Toxoplasmosis gondii. Outdoor exposures such as swimming, fishing, and hiking make infec- tion with L. monocytogenes, Borrelia burgdorferi, Rickettsia rickettsii, or species of blastomyces, leptospira, or aeromonas seem plausible.3,4,13 Fi- nally, the patient may have had exposure to en- demic pathogens in equatorial Central Africa, such as brucella species, schistosoma species,\nC. burnetii, Wuchereria bancrofti, or Taenia solium, all of which have been associated with myocardi- tis.3,14 On the basis of the infectious evaluation we had conducted up to this point in the patient\u2019s hospital course, infections with M. tuberculosis,\nL. monocytogenes, S. pneumoniae, and species of blastomyces, leptospira, and aeromonas remained as possible causes of myocarditis in this case.\nWe had the benefit of monitoring the evolu- tion of this patient\u2019s symptoms over a 1-week period, including his response to empirical anti-microbial therapy. There was a notable decrease in fever and back pain, and the C-reactive protein level also trended downward after the addi- tion of doxycycline. It was reasonable to con- clude that he had subacute infectious regional myocarditis caused by a bacterial infection that was responsive to doxycycline but not to ceftri- axone, which left L. monocytogenes as the pathogen that was most likely responsible for the patient\u2019s clinical presentation.15 Although endomyocardial biopsy may confirm the diagnosis of myocardi- tis caused by L. monocytogenes, the risks associated with biopsy were thought to outweigh the bene- fits, so microbial cell-free DNA sequencing was recommended as an alternative diagnostic test.\ntein level also trended downward after the addi- tion of doxycycline.

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Bianca B. Christensen: The diagnostic test in this case was microbial cell-free DNA sequencing performed at a reference laboratory. This test,which is similar to the cell-free DNA sequencing used for the detection of fetal abnormalities and for cancer diagnostics, is performed with the use of patient plasma. When the plasma speci- men is received at the reference laboratory, cell- free DNA fragments are extracted from the specimen and converted to shotgun DNA se- quencing libraries. The DNA fragments are then sequenced, and an analysis is performed to cal- culate the concentration of cell-free DNA mole- cules from any potential pathogen. This technol- ogy can detect more than 1000 potential viable and nonviable pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, DNA viruses, and eukaryotes. In this case,\nL. monocytogenes was detected at a concentration\nof 42 cell-free DNA molecules per microliter (reference value, <10); this finding confirmed the diagnosis of listeriosis. The results were as- sociated with 95% sensitivity (at 41 molecules per microliter) and 98 to 99.99% specificity for the diagnosis of listeriosis.\n",
