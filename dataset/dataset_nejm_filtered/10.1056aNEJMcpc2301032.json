    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. W.K. Claudia Wu: A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong because of abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nThe patient had been well until 6 months before this admission, when colicky, diffuse abdominal pain developed. She also had nonbloody diarrhea that occurred up to 10 times daily. During the subsequent 6 months, the patient noticed de- creased appetite and weight loss of 5 kg. The symptoms did not abate, and her family encouraged her to seek medical evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported gradually darkening skin on the face, arms, and legs, as well as hair thinning and changes in the appearance of all the finger- nails and toenails during the previous 4 months. There was no nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hematochezia, fevers, or night sweats.\nThe patient had a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Ten months before this admission, she had sought evaluation by a traditional Chinese medicine prac- titioner because of irregular menses. She was given a \u201chomemade\u201d traditional Chinese medicine that contained unknown ingredients. The patient took the rem- edy for 4 months and stopped taking it when the abdominal pain and diarrhea developed 6 months before this admission. She did not take other medications and had no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband and son in an urban area of Hong Kong, and she did not work outside the home. She did not vape or smoke cigarettes, and she did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy; there was no family history of gastroenterologic, autoimmune, or hereditary diseases.\nOn evaluation, the temporal temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, and the heart rate 85 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20. Examinations of the thyroid, heart, and lungs were normal. The abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopa- thy. Moderate pitting edema was observed in the lower legs, up to the mid-calf. Dr. W.S. Agnes Chan: On dermatologic examination, the patient had patchy hair loss, with a large patch of alopecia at the vertex of the scalp; there was no scarring of the scalp (Fig. 1A). A hair-pull test (in which 40 to 60 strands of closely grouped hair are gently pulled, with more than 10% of hairs pulled out indicating a posi- tive result) was negative. There were symmetric brown macules over the lateral lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Fig. 1B and 1C), and hyperpigmentation and diffuse brown-gray mac- ules were observed over the palms and the pal- mar aspects of the fingers (Fig. 1D and 1E). Onychodystrophy was present on all the finger- nails (Fig. 1E) and toenails. There was  onycholysis with distal separation of the nail plates from the nail beds, thinned nail plates, distal nail- plate crumbling, and onychomadesis with proxi- mal separation of the nail plates from the nail matrices (Fig. 1E and 1F).\nDr.  Wu:  The  blood  level  of  hemoglobin was 10.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 11.9 to 15.1) with a low mean corpuscular volume. The white- cell count, C-reactive protein level, and erythro- cyte sedimentation rate in blood were normal. The blood level of potassium was 2.9 mmol per liter (reference range, 3.5 to 5.0), ionized calcium 0.85 mmol per liter (reference range, 1.13 to 1.32), phosphate 0.52 mmol per liter (reference range, 0.72 to 1.43), and zinc 8.8 \u03bcmol per liter (refer- ence range, 10.7 to 18.0). The blood level of albu- min was 14 g per liter (reference range, 33 to 48). The protein level in a spot urine sample was normal. A stool culture showed normal enteric flora. Testing of a stool specimen for Clostridium difficile antigen and Shiga toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1. Photographs of the Scalp and Skin.\nNonscarring alopecia is observed over the vertex of the scalp (Panel A); a hair\u2011pull test was negative. Symmetric brown macules are present over the lower cheeks and malar regions of the face (Panels B and C), and diffuse brown\u2011gray hyperpigmented macules are present over the palms and the palmar aspects of the fingers (Panels D and E). Onychodystrophy and onycholysis are present on all the fingernails (Panels E and F) and toenails.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Jimmy C.T. Lai: I was involved in the care of\nthis patient and am aware of the final diagnosis.\nThis 43-year-old woman presented with weight\nloss, chronic diarrhea, and multiple cutaneous\nabnormalities, including changes to the nails,\nhair loss, and skin hyperpigmentation that de-\nveloped after the use of a traditional Chinese\nmedicine containing unknown ingredients. There\nwas laboratory evidence of malabsorption and\nelectrolyte disturbance, findings consistent with\nprotein-losing enteropathy. In constructing a\ndifferential diagnosis, I will consider diseases\nthat cause protein-losing enteropathy and are\nassociated with dermatologic manifestations.\nAutoimmune Diseases\nInflammatory bowel disease, systemic vasculitis,\nsystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and celiac\ndisease are autoimmune disorders that may cause\nchronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Inflamma-\ntory bowel disease, especially Crohn\u2019s disease,\nmanifests with abdominal pain and chronic diar-\nrhea that can be nonbloody. If there is small-\nbowel involvement, malabsorption can occur,\nwith resultant electrolyte abnormalities, micro-\nnutrient deficiencies, and weight loss, all of\nwhich were seen in this patient. Extraintestinal\nmanifestations of Crohn\u2019s disease that affect the\nskin include erythema nodosum (characterized\nby raised, erythematous, tender nodules appear-\ning mainly on the shins), pyoderma gangrenosum\n(characterized by ulcerations with violaceous\nedges appearing mainly on the legs), and Sweet\u2019s\nsyndrome (characterized by a sudden onset of\npainful nodules and fevers).1 This patient\u2019s skin\nchanges are not consistent with these features of\nCrohn\u2019s disease.\nA systemic vasculitis, such as Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease,\nor intestinal vasculitis can also lead to chronic\ndiarrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and rashes.\nHowever, the absence of a purpuric rash and of\noral, ophthalmic, or genital ulcers in this patient\nmakes this diagnosis unlikely.2\nSLE has been associated with protein-losing",

    "Key testing result": "Tests for autoimmune markers were negative, with the exception of a weakly positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test with an antiproteinase 3 antibody level of 27.1 RU per milliliter. The anti\u2013tissue transglutamin- ase IgA level was normal, as were the pituitary hormone levels. The blood level of free triiodo- thyronine was suggestive of euthyroid sick syn- drome.\nA colonoscopy revealed nonspecific colitis, and numerous sessile polyps in clusters were observed throughout the entire colon (Fig. 2C). On white-light examination, the colonic polyps were hyperemic with a strawberry-like appear- ance (Fig. 2D). With narrow-band imaging, the pit patterns of the polyps were regular and stel- lar (Kudo classification type II) (Fig. 2E), a find- ing that was suggestive of inflammatory and non-neoplastic polyps. \nTable 2.

Images Obtained during EGD and Colonoscopy and Resection Specimens.\nImages from esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) show multiple inflammatory gastric polyps in the pre\u2011 pyloric antrum (Panel A) and diffuse villous atrophy in the second part of the duodenum (Panel B). Images from colonoscopy show numerous sessile polyps in clusters throughout the entire colon (Panel C). On white\u2011light examination, large colonic polyps that are hyperemic with a strawberry\u2011like appearance are ob\u2011 served (Panel D); with narrow\u2011band imaging, the pit patterns of these polyps are regular and papillary, con\u2011 sistent with Kudo classification type II (Panel E). On hematoxylin and eosin staining, a resection specimen from a polyp from the descending colon shows hamar\u2011 tomatous features, including cystic dilatation of crypts with inflammatory infiltrate in edematous stroma at low magnification (Panel F) and higher magnification (Panel G).\nenteropathy.3,4 However, with the exception of\nnonscarring alopecia, this patient does not meet\nclinical criteria that would indicate a diagnosis\nof SLE.5 Nonetheless, additional immunologic\ntests should be performed to rule out SLE.\nCeliac disease can be associated with derma-titis herpetiformis, a rash characterized by itchy\npapules and vesicles that are distributed sym-\nmetrically over the shoulders, elbows, and knees.\nBecause celiac disease is rare in the Asian popu-\nlation6 and this patient\u2019s skin findings would be\natypical of celiac disease, this diagnosis is also\nunlikely.\nPrimary Adrenal Insufficiency\nPrimary adrenal insufficiency (also known as\nAddison\u2019s disease) is associated with a variety of\nclinical manifestations, ranging from malaise\nand weight loss to nonspecific gastrointestinal\nsymptoms, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea,\nand can cause amenorrhea in female patients.\nCortisol insufficiency causes overproduction of\nproopiomelanocortin and subsequent excessive\nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone, leading to some\ndegree of skin hyperpigmentation in most pa-\ntients. This patient has weight loss, abdominal\npain, diarrhea, menstrual abnormalities, and\nskin hyperpigmentation; however, Addison\u2019s dis-\nease is not associated with hair loss or nail\nchanges.\nHeavy-Metal Poisoning\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms began soon after the\nuse of a traditional Chinese medicine with un-\nknown ingredients, which suggested the possi-\nbility of heavy-metal poisoning caused by inges-\ntion of either arsenic or lead.7-9 Arsenic poisoning\ncan cause skin hyperpigmentation but does not\ntypically result in hair and nail changes. Lead\npoisoning can cause gastrointestinal symptoms\nsuch as abdominal pain but not skin changes.\nChronic arsenic or lead poisoning may cause\nother systemic symptoms, such as sensorimotor\npolyneuropathy, but those symptoms are not\npresent in this patient.\nCancer and Amyloidosis\nCancer is always an important consideration in\nthe differential diagnosis of unintentional weight\nloss. Colorectal cancer is possible in this patient,\ndespite her relatively young age and the absence\nof risk factors. In particular, rectal cancer, the\nincidence of which is rising among younger\nadults,10,11 can cause diarrhea. Gastrointestinal\nlymphoma can lead to chronic diarrhea and\nprotein-losing enteropathy, along with cutane-\nous involvement, although such manifestations\nare uncommon.\nAmyloidosis can affect many organs and has\na variety of manifestations. Systemic amyloido-\nsis can cause rash, whereas amyloidosis that\naffects the gastrointestinal tract can lead to\nprotein-losing enteropathy, malabsorption, and\nconstitutional symptoms.12 Amyloidosis is a rare\ndisease, and a biopsy of the affected sites would\nbe needed to confirm the presence of amyloid\ndeposition.\nOther Diseases\nDespite the absence of fever in this patient, in-\nfection is a consideration. Tuberculosis is preva-\nlent in the area where this patient lives, and\ngastrointestinal tuberculosis can cause chronic\ndiarrhea and constitutional symptoms such as\nweight loss. However, the absence of fevers and\nnight sweats, as well as the presence of hair and\nnail changes, are not consistent with the diagno-\nsis of tuberculosis.\nThe Cronkhite\u2013Canada syndrome (CCS), a\nrare, apparently noninherited hamartomatous\npolyposis syndrome, may account for many of\nthe features of this patient\u2019s clinical presenta-\ntion. This syndrome was first reported by Dr.\nL.W. Cronkhite, Jr., and Dr. W.J. Canada in 1955,13\nand since then, only approximately 500 cases\nhave been reported worldwide.14,15 CCS is charac-\nterized by the presence of multiple hamartoma-\ntous polyps throughout the gastrointestinal tract\n(apart from the esophagus), as well as multiple\ncutaneous changes, including loss of the hair\nand nails and hyperpigmentation of the skin.\nPatients with CCS usually present with diarrhea\nand protein-losing enteropathy as the dominant\ngastrointestinal symptoms.14,16,17 Patients do not\nnecessarily have the full-blown cutaneous mani-\nfestations at presentation, and the severity of the\nskin changes, which are reversible, may evolve\nwith underlying disease activity.18\nThere are no established diagnostic criteria\nfor CCS, and the diagnosis should be considered\nwhen clinical characteristics compatible with\nCCS, such as this patient\u2019s gastrointestinal and\ncutaneous symptoms, are present and when\nother conditions are ruled out. Then, the diag-\nnosis can be established if multiple hamartoma-\ntous polyps are identified in the gastrointestinal\ntract. This patient has many clinical features of\nCCS, and an endoscopic examination would\nmost likely reveal multiple polyps that should be\nresected for histologic examination.",
