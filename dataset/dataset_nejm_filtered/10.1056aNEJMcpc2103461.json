    "Primary Symptom": "A 41-Year-Old Woman with Bloody Stools and Thrombocytopenia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Matthew B. Roberts: A 41-year-old woman who had undergone renal transplanta- tion was admitted to this hospital because of bloody stools and thrombocytopenia. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before this admission, when mild rectal discomfort and nonbloody diarrhea developed. The episodes of diarrhea occurred several times a day and were not associated with\nfever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.\nTwo weeks before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at this hospital. The abdominal and rectal examinations were normal. The hemoglobin level was\n11.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the platelet count 129,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Stool cultures and tests of the stool for Clostridioides difficile antigen and toxin and Shiga toxin were negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with docusate was stopped, treatment with topical rectal hydrocortisone cream was started, and a recommendation was made to increase the amount of fiber in the diet. During the next week, the episodes of diarrhea decreased in frequency to once a day; however, the rectal pain persisted.\nOne week before this admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician because the rectal pain had worsened; she was unable to sit down, and new tenesmus was present. A rectal examination revealed mild tenderness and thin yellow-brown liquid stool, with no evidence of blood or an external anal injury. A radiograph of the abdomen was normal. Docusate, senna, and topical lidocaine jelly were prescribed.\nThree days before this admission, bowel movements with tarry black and loose maroon stools and dark clots began to occur multiple times a day. When the epi- sodes increased in frequency to every hour and there was bright-red blood per rectum, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported severe rectal pain and burning, as well as fatigue, dizziness, and weak- ness. She did not report fever, chills, abdominal pain, hematemesis, hemoptysis, epistaxis, rash, bruising, hematuria, or menorrhagia.\nThe patient was congenitally deaf. She had received a diagnosis of kidney disease 12 years earlier, when proteinuria and hypertension de- veloped during pregnancy and did not resolve postpartum. Pathological examination of a renal biopsy specimen had reportedly revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The patient was presumed to have Alport\u2019s syndrome; no genetic testing had been performed.\nTen years before the current evaluation, the patient had discontinued all prescribed medica- tions, including prednisone and labetalol, with- out talking to her doctors; 3 years later, she pre- sented to this hospital with dyspnea on exertion and end-stage renal failure. Hemodialysis was started and continued until a deceased-donor renal transplantation was performed 6 months before the current evaluation.\nRoutine pretransplantation serologic testing of the patient revealed IgG antibodies to Epstein\u2013 Barr virus (EBV) and no antibodies to cytomega- lovirus (CMV). Serologic testing of the donor also revealed IgG antibodies to EBV and no antibodies to CMV. Induction immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin, belatacept, predni- sone, and everolimus was initiated; famciclovir was administered for 3 months after transplan- tation. Treatment with prednisone was stopped 2 months after transplantation, when diabetes developed.\nAt the time of the current evaluation, medications included aspirin, linagliptin, trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole, and omeprazole, as well as cholecalciferol, docusate, senna, topical hydro- cortisone cream, and topical lidocaine jelly. The dose of everolimus had been decreased 1 month before this evaluation; belatacept had last been infused 2 weeks earlier. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived with her male partner and young son in an urban area of New England. She had not traveled recently. She had previously worked part-time as a teacher. There had been no exposure to animals other than two pet dogs. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol. Her sister was deaf and had a history of renal failure that had led to renal transplantation. Her father had a history of diabetes and renal failure that required hemodialysis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/46 mm Hg, the pulse 130 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared pale and unwell. There was no jaun- dice or lymphadenopathy. There were palatal petechiae and sublingual ecchymoses, but there was no bleeding from the gums or nose. There was a healed surgical incision in the right lower abdomen and no tenderness over the renal allo- graft. A rectal examination revealed tenderness and dark blood with clots.\nThe hemoglobin level was 6.0 g per deciliter\nand the platelet count 0 per microliter. A periph- eral-blood smear showed red cells that were generally normal in size and morphology, with few hypochromic cells and rare pencil cells; there were no schistocytes or platelets. A direct antiglobulin test was negative. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Onofrio A. Catalano: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with- out the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no bowel-wall thickening or distention. The spleen and liver were normal in size. The renal allograft was visible in the right lower quadrant (Fig. 1). The transplanted kidney was enlarged and surrounded by extensive peri- nephric fat stranding. A small amount of free f luid was also present. There was moderate hydroureteronephrosis that extended up to the ureterovesical anastomosis. The renal collecting system, pelvis, and ureter contained spontane- ously hyperdense material that was suggestive of blood breakdown products. No obstructing cal- culi were seen.\nDr. Roberts: Intravenous f luids were administered, and the blood pressure increased to 97/53 mm Hg. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with everolimus and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was stopped. During the next 24 hours, 4 units of packed red cells and 5 units of pooled platelets were trans- fused. On the second hospital day, the hemoglo- bin level was 11.0 g per deciliter and the platelet count 4 per microliter.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Olivia C. Smibert: This 41-year-old recipient of a deceased-donor kidney transplant presented with a biphasic illness, characterized initially by proc- tocolitis and subsequently by profound thrombo- cytopenia and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, fea- tures consistent with immune thrombocytopenia. Proctocolitis and immune thrombocytopenia are typically independent processes, but since these two conditions developed during the same time period, I will build my differential diagnosis around these disease processes in an attempt to establish a unifying diagnosis. Review of the patient\u2019s immunosuppressive regimen, the results of peritransplantation screening of the donor and recipient, and the patient\u2019s history of epide- miologic exposures may provide important clues in determining the most likely cause of this presentation.\n\nProctocolitis\nThis patient\u2019s diarrhea, rectal pain, and tenesmus suggest an abnormality that involves both the colon and the rectum. On the basis of the clini- cal history, laboratory findings, and imaging studies provided, several important noninfec- tious causes of proctocolitis \u2014 including cancer, ischemic colitis, and inflammatory bowel dis- ease \u2014 can be ruled out.\nThe absence of a mass on rectal examination and the absence of signs of a regional or distant tumor on abdominal CT make primary bowel cancer unlikely. EBV-induced post-transplanta- tion lymphoproliferative disorder can involve the gastrointestinal tract and cause gastrointestinal bleeding, but this condition is often associated with constitutional symptoms and occurs much less frequently in EBV-seropositive recipients than in EBV-seronegative recipients. In addition, immunosuppression with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors has been associ- ated with reduced carcinogenesis after single- organ transplantation.\nIntestinal ischemia is typically associated with a more acute onset than that observed in this patient, and abdominal pain is the predominant symptom. New diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease after single-organ transplantation have occasionally been described; the condition can cause bloody diarrhea, but it typically occurs years rather than months after transplantation, which is not consistent with this patient\u2019s pre- sentation.\nInfections with C. difficile, shigella, and campy- lobacter species are unlikely in this patient because of the negative stool culture. Hemolytic\u2013 uremic syndrome associated with Shiga toxin\u2013 producing Escherichia coli or Shigella dysenteriae is typically a biphasic illness, characterized ini- tially by abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea and subsequently by thrombocytopenia, hemo- lytic anemia, and acute kidney injury. Although this patient\u2019s colitis with hemorrhage and throm- bocytopenia is consistent with this diagnosis, the findings on examination of a peripheral- blood smear and laboratory evaluation are not consistent with microangiopathic hemolysis or acute kidney injury associated with this syn- drome. Furthermore, the negative immunoas- say for Shiga toxin makes this diagnosis un- likely.\nHemorrhagic gastroenteritis is infrequently\ncaused by infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which is transmitted by ingestion of contami- nated seafood and is occasionally associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. This diagnosis is unlikely, since the median duration of illness is days rather than weeks and the pa- tient did not have a history of recent seafood ingestion. She presented with hypotension and bleeding, but the absence of coagulopathy on laboratory evaluation is not consistent with dis- seminated intravascular coagulation. A stool ex- amination was negative for ova, cysts, and para- sites, and the features of her presentation would be atypical for a fungal infection. The remaining considerations in this case include sexually trans- mitted infections associated with proctitis, as well as infections caused by the herpesvirus family of pathogens.\n\nSexually   Transmitted    Infections Gastrointestinal manifestations of common sex- ually transmitted infections are not always rec- ognized by clinicians.1 Although a more detailed history was not available for this patient, a de- tailed sexual history should be considered in the evaluation of any patient who presents with rectal symptoms. Infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae,\nChlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum can all cause a spectrum of rectal symptoms, includ- ing typical features of proctitis, and severe dis- ease can occasionally mimic inflammatory bowel\n \ndisease. However, infections with these organ- isms are not typically associated with pathologi- cal findings proximal to the rectum or with ex- traintestinal hematologic manifestations.2,3 The most invasive serotypes of C. trachomatis can cause lymphogranuloma venereum, with a hemorrhagic proctocolitis that is typically associated with severe anorectal pain. However, lymphogranu- loma venereum often leads to painful lymphade- nopathy (although this finding is less common in women than in men) and is rarely reported in the United States outside of an outbreak.4,5\nHerpes simplex virus can also cause painful proctitis, often with associated perianal lesions. Invasive disease may involve the colon proximal to the rectum, particularly in immunocompro- mised patients.6 In the presence of immunocom- promise, reactivation of latent virus is more likely than primary infection. Although procto- colitis due to herpes simplex virus has been associated with extraintestinal manifestations, including sacral anesthesia, urinary retention, and impotence, it is not frequently associated with immune thrombocytopenia or other hema- tologic abnormalities.2,6-9 Therefore, herpes sim- plex virus infection would be a reasonable expla- nation of the proctocolitis in this patient, but the absence of perianal lesions on external rectal examination and the presence of profound he- matologic manifestations would be atypical of this diagnosis.\n\nCytomegalovirus\nCMV is a notable cause of post-transplantation complications and death. Although both the do- nor and the recipient were seronegative for CMV in this case, the patient remains at risk for ac- quired primary CMV infection, which is more severe in immunocompromised patients.3,10 Trans- mission of CMV can occur through multiple routes, including sexual intercourse, close con- tacts, and occupational exposures, such as child care.11-13 This patient had a number of risk fac- tors for primary acquisition of CMV, including a child at home and a previous occupation with exposure to children. Tissue-invasive CMV infec- tion frequently involves the gastrointestinal tract, and proctocolitis has been well described with both primary infection and reactivation of latent disease.14-16 CMV infection is also associated with a range of hematologic manifestations, including anemia, the development of cold agglutinins,disseminated intravascular coagulation, and im- mune thrombocytopenia.\n\nImmune Thrombocytopenia\nImmune thrombocytopenia is an acquired throm- bocytopenia caused by antiplatelet autoantibod- ies directed against platelet antigens.20 Molecular mimicry between viral antigens and host pro- teins has been implicated in the pathogenesis of secondary immune thrombocytopenia, which may be associated with several acute and chron- ic infections.20 Acute immune thrombocytopenia has most frequently been observed in children, often after a recent documented illness, with CMV and other members of the herpesvirus family frequently implicated.21 CMV-associated immune thrombocytopenia has been described in recipients of solid-organ transplants and is more likely to be associated with primary infec- tion than with reactivation of latent disease. CMV-associated immune thrombocytopenia may be refractory to standard therapy; there are some reports of paradoxical worsening of thrombocy- topenia in the presence of glucocorticoids and im- provement in response to antiviral therapy.17,22-25\nImmunosuppression with Belatacept\nThis patient had received belatacept, a fusion protein composed of the Fc fragment of human IgG1 linked to the extracellular domain of cyto- toxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4, which was developed as a calcineurin inhibitor\u2013sparing agent for use in kidney-transplant recipients.26\nBecause calcineurin inhibitors act downstream of the T-cell receptor, they inhibit activation of both mature and immature T cells; by contrast, the effect of belatacept is decreasingly evident in increasingly mature T cells.27 The side-effect pro- file of belatacept includes impaired antiviral immunity, particularly in patients who have a primary viral infection and have not been previously infected with the virus (Fig. 2).27 This effect of belatacept was first observed in EBV-sero- negative kidney-transplant recipients, in whom the risk of EBV-induced post-transplantation lym- phoproliferative disorder was 9 times the risk in EBV-seropositive recipients. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning against the use of belatacept in EBV-seronegative patients.\nWith increasing use of belatacept, a growing number of reports describe atypical and severe CMV infection in the context of kidney trans- plantation.26 These reports suggest higher rates of primary CMV disease, specifically severe, tissue- invasive, and life-threatening disease, and higher rates of resistance to ganciclovir in recipients treated with belatacept than in those treated with calcineurin inhibitors.28-30\nThis patient was seronegative for CMV at the time of transplantation, which put her at high risk for severe and uncontrolled primary viral infection in the presence of belatacept immuno- suppression, because of the inhibition of critical T-cell antiviral immune responses to new infec- tion. CMV disease frequently affects the gastro- intestinal tract, including the squamous epithe- lium of the rectum, where there is a high density of somatic nerve endings that may be associated with clinically significant pain. CMV is also well described to be associated with the production of antiplatelet autoantibodies, and immune throm- bocytopenia can occur during primary infection. The constellation of symptoms and laboratory findings in this case is highly suggestive of se- vere primary CMV infection causing proctocoli- tis and secondary immune thrombocytopenia in the context of impaired antiviral immunity to new infection due to belatacept immunosuppression. To establish this diagnosis, I would obtain blood samples for a CMV nucleic acid test; if the test is negative, I would consider sigmoidoscopy with biopsy.\n",
