    "Primary Symptom": "An 82-Year-Old Woman with Falls and Cognitive Decline",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Will Pohlman (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of difficulty walking, falls, and cognitive decline.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health, living independently with her husband and participating in a walking club, until 8 months before the current presentation, when generalized weakness developed. She began to walk more slowly and was no longer active with her walking club; she felt limited by pain in her feet.\nFive months before the current presentation, the patient began to have diffi- culty with climbing stairs and with rising from a seated position. Four months before the current presentation, she began to have falls at home.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient fell and her husband was not able to lift her up from the floor. Emergency medical services were called, and she was admitted to another hospital for evaluation. During that hospitaliza- tion, a urinary tract infection and hyponatremia were diagnosed. The urinary tract infection was treated with trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone and was treated with fluid restriction and salt tablets. The use of a walker was recom- mended, and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. After 3 weeks in the rehabilitation facility, she was discharged home, but she fell again at home and subsequently returned to the other hospital for evaluation. She was readmitted to the other hospital and again discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nEight weeks before the current presentation, the patient was discharged from the rehabilitation facility, and she and her husband moved to an assisted-living facility. Fatigue developed, along with loss of appetite and a reduced intake of food. The patient began to need one-person assistance to walk. She also noticed that she had been having difficulty with math associated with the family finances, which she had always done with ease. Her family noticed that she had been having trouble carrying on a conversation and that she seemed less attentive than usual.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, the patient had another fall and was admitted to a second hospital, where she was found to have hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnese- mia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head reportedly showed moderate chronic small- vessel ischemic changes and ventriculomegaly. Increased food intake was encouraged, and outpatient evaluation in the neurology clinic af- filiated with the second hospital was arranged. Discharge to a rehabilitation facility was recom- mended, but after discussions between the pa- tient and her family, the patient returned to the assisted-living facility.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, the patient\nhad a progressive loss of independence. She noted worsening generalized weakness and low back pain, and she needed two-person assistance to walk. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported urinary incontinence, which she attrib- uted to not having enough time to get to the toilet because of her physical limitations with movement; she had no dysuria or urinary urgency. There was no fecal incontinence.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. Surgical his- tory included hemiarthroplasty of the right shoulder and arthroplasty of both knees. She had chronic pain in the shoulders, knees, wrists, and hands, which had been attributed to osteo- arthritis; the knee and shoulder pain had de- creased after the surgeries but then returned during the year before the current presentation. Medications included atorvastatin, calcium ci- trate, levothyroxine, lisinopril, and tramadol. She had no known drug allergies. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. In addition to her husband, her support network included four children who lived near the assist- ed-living facility. She was retired and had previ- ously worked in finance. Her mother had had diabetes, and her father had had thyroid cancer; there was no known family history of dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature\nwas 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/54 mm Hg, the respira-\n \ntory rate 17 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breath- ing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.8. She appeared tired but was oriented to person and place. Pit- ting edema was present in the legs to the level of the mid-shins. A detailed strength examina- tion was limited because of pain, with minimal movement of the shoulders, wrists, fingers, ankles, and knees. The patient could wiggle her toes but had weak plantar f lexion and dorsi- f lexion of both feet. She could easily wiggle her fingers and lift her arms against gravity at the elbows. Light touch of the dorsum of the right hand caused pain, as did light touch of the right knee and the soles of both feet. Recogni- tion of sensation to light touch and to vibration were normal. Cerebellar testing, gait testing, and reflex testing were limited by severe pain with movement and touch. The patient had symmetric erythema, swelling, and tenderness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal in- terphalangeal joints. She had limited range of motion in the wrists and elbows, along with symmetric tenderness in the subtalar joints and swelling and pain with squeezing of the meta- tarsophalangeal joints.\nThe blood levels of alcohol, ammonia, alanine\naminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin were nor- mal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and urine toxicology screening; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative) and the presence of nitrates (reference value, negative), and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). Urine was obtained for culture, and intravenous ceftri- axone was administered. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Ambrose J. Huang: Computed tomography\n(CT) of the head, performed without the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, re- vealed moderate ventriculomegaly that was out of proportion to the enlargement of the cerebral sulci (Fig. 1).\nDr. Pohlman: A high-volume lumbar puncture with gait evaluation before and after the procedure was not possible, given the patient\u2019s inability to walk unassisted. Normal-pressure hydrocepha- lus was generally thought to be unlikely to ex- plain her presentation. Altered mental status was attributed to delirium in the context of tramadol use and urinary tract infection. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, the urine culture grew Citrobacter farmeri; treatment with trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole was started. MRI of the cervi- cal and lumbar spine, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was terminated early because of the patient\u2019s pain, and the images that were obtained were degraded by motion artifacts. However, no marked signal abnormality in the spinal cord or high- grade spinal or foraminal stenosis was observed. Additional laboratory studies were obtained. Tests for antibodies to human immunodefi- ciency virus types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus an- tibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies were negative. The blood levels of glycated hemoglo- bin and cobalamin were normal, as were the results of serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; blood samples were obtained for measurement of copper and vitamin B6 lev- els. Treatment with gabapentin was started for neuropathic pain. On hospital day 3, pain had not decreased, and the dose of gabapentin was increased.\nDr. Bart K. Chwalisz: On hospital day 4, electro- myography and nerve conduction studies were performed. The amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was normal with stimulation of the right tibial nerve but was reduced with stimulation of the left tibial nerve and both peroneal nerves; in addition, the CMAP amplitude of the left ulnar nerve was mildly re- duced, and that of the left median nerve was normal. The sensory-nerve action potential of the left radial nerve was normal, but the senso- ry-nerve action potential of the left sural nerve could not be obtained. The conduction velocities and distal latencies were normal. There was no abnormal spontaneous activity in any muscle examined. The motor-unit action potentials and motor-unit recruitment with voluntary activation were normal throughout.\nDr. Pohlman: The results of the additional\nblood tests became available. The copper level was normal, and the vitamin B6 level was less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50).\nTreatment with vitamin B6 supplementation was started.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "Inflammatory polyneuropathy;mononeuritis multiplex.",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Adam Berkwitt: This previously healthy 8-week- old male infant presented with irritability that had lasted for 1 week, a frequently encountered clinical presentation. After he was admitted to the hospital, lethargy and hypotonia developed rapidly. It is likely that the patient\u2019s irritability, lethargy, and hypotonia have a unifying cause. I will be- gin by sharing my approach to the evaluation of an infant with irritability. I will then attempt to narrow the differential diagnosis by considering causes of hypotonia.\n\nIrritability in an Infant\nIrritability in an infant can be caused by common, easily reversible conditions but also by life-threat- ening conditions that require rapid recognition and treatment. Symptoms may not be clear in infants, and signs can be easily missed. A sys- tematic approach that involves an evaluation of each body system sequentially can be helpful.1 However, given the immunocompromised and unimmunized status of infants, I will first con- sider infections.\n\nInfections\nA localized infection in an infant can easily spread to cause an invasive disease, such as bacteremia or meningitis. This patient\u2019s examination findings ruled out common infections, such as acute otitis media and skin and soft-tissue infections, that may have served as initial foci of invasive disease. The normal results on urinalysis lower the likeli- hood of a urinary tract infection. The presence of only 2 nucleated cells per microliter on CSF analysis is not consistent with meningitis. The findings on chest radiography are not suggestive of pneumonia. He did not have pseudoparalysis of an arm or leg, which would suggest underlying osteomyelitis or an infected joint. In addition, he did not have fever or hypothermia, and the white- cell count was normal. Because there was no clear evidence of an infection that would explain the patient\u2019s irritability, I will next use the head- to-toe method to consider causes of irritability associated with each system of the body.\n\nNeurologic Causes\nNeurologic causes of irritability in an infant \u2014 including stroke, hydrocephalus, cerebral edema, and masses \u2014 are unlikely in this patient, given that he did not have focal neurologic deficits or a bulging fontanelle and had normal results on neuroimaging. Seizures are also unlikely because he did not have any witnessed seizure activity.\n\nOcular Causes\nPain from a corneal abrasion can cause irritabil- ity in an infant. A fluorescein test could be con- sidered to further evaluate for this possibility.\n\nCardiopulmonary Causes\nThe patient\u2019s normal chest radiograph, without evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema, makes heart failure and myocarditis unlikely. An arrhythmia is also unlikely, given the normal heart rate. There is no report of foreign-body in- gestion, choking, or abnormal respiratory sounds that would suggest aspiration.\n\nGastrointestinal Causes\nParents and pediatricians frequently anchor on the gastrointestinal system when trying to find a reason for irritability. Common diagnoses in- clude constipation, gas, reflux, and colic. This patient\u2019s irritability was initially attributed to gas when he was first evaluated by the primary care physician. When he presented to this hospi- tal, he had no history of bilious emesis, and the findings on abdominal examination, the abdom- inal radiograph and ultrasound image, and the blood levels of lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin were all normal. These features make appendicitis, intus- susception, pancreatitis, hepatobiliary disease, and other causes of obstruction unlikely. Furthermore,\nappendicitis and intussusception occur rarely in this age group.\n\nGenitourinary Causes\nThe patient\u2019s normal findings on testicular ex- amination make testicular torsion, hernia, or hair tourniquet unlikely to be the cause of his irritability. The normal results on urinalysis are not consistent with nephrolithiasis.\n\nSkin and Soft-Tissue Causes\nTo rule out irritability associated with pain, an examination of all parts of the skin and muscu- loskeletal system for any signs of injury is es- sential. Fractures, which can be accidental or possibly signify child abuse, may be associated with swelling, bruising, or decreased movement, none of which was present when the patient was initially evaluated at this hospital.\n\nCancer\nInfants with leukemia or neuroblastoma can pres- ent with irritability. The absence of fever, hepa- tomegaly, cytopenia, and peripheral blasts in this patient is reassuring. Furthermore, the absence of opsoclonus\u2013myoclonus syndrome and ecchy- moses around the eyes makes neuroblastoma un- likely, as do the normal abdominal ultrasound image and chest radiograph.\n\nMetabolic Causes\nAcute dehydration may be associated with irrita- bility and was probably present in this patient, given the reported decreased oral intake and the decreased bicarbonate level with an elevated anion gap, which was presumably from ketosis, since he had a normal lactic acid level. Congenital con- ditions involving inborn errors of metabolism are important considerations in an infant with irri- tability. This patient had been healthy and devel- oping appropriately, so these diagnoses are un- likely. Furthermore, he did not have evidence of hepatomegaly or dysmorphisms on examination, and the absence of marked abnormalities in elec- trolyte levels and acid\u2013base status also reassures that there is not an underlying congenital meta- bolic cause.\n\nIngestions and Toxidromes\nPediatricians would consider ingestions and toxi- dromes in any patient with irritability. However, these conditions are more likely to occur in toddlers. An ingestion in this 8-week-old infant is unlikely, and urine toxicology screening was negative.\n\nHypotonia in an Infant\nDespite the use of a systematic approach, there is no obvious cause of irritability on the basis of the initial patient history and the findings on physical examination, laboratory testing, and im- aging. I will now focus on the differential diag- nosis of hypotonia in this patient. The evaluation of an infant with hypotonia centers on conditions that affect either the central nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, or the periph- eral nervous system (PNS), including the motor neurons, muscles, nerves, and neuromuscular junction.2 Two rare causes of hypotonia that do not quite fit into this physiologic model are tick paralysis and paralytic shellfish poisoning, neither of which is likely in this patient, given that no ticks were observed on examination and no his- tory of shellfish ingestion was reported.\n\nCNS Disease\nIn infants, 60 to 80% of cases of hypotonia are attributed to CNS diseases, specifically hypoxic\u2013 ischemic encephalopathy and cerebral palsy.3 However, this patient\u2019s normal results on neuro- imaging and reduced reflexes make both of these diagnoses unlikely. Imaging of the spinal cord was not performed, but there is no report of trauma that would suggest spinal cord injury, and the hypotonia was generalized. Other infec- tious or postinfectious conditions \u2014 such as trans- verse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomy- elitis, or acute flaccid myelitis \u2014 are unlikely in the absence of fever, a preceding illness, and CSF pleocytosis.\n\nPNS Disease\nIn this patient with normal results on neuroim- aging and with features suggestive of bulbar palsies (a weak cry, ptosis in both eyes, and poor feeding), a PNS disease is the most likely cause of hypotonia. The overall severe and acute pre- sentation, which occurred after previous normal development, makes congenital or metabolic my- opathy unlikely, as does the normal muscle bulk on examination. An acquired myositis would be unlikely to cause such a severe presentation and would not explain the patient\u2019s altered mental status. Spinal muscular atrophy, which is a degenerative motor neuron disease, has a rapid onset of symptoms in rare cases. However, no other musculoskeletal abnormalities or tongue fascic- ulations that would suggest this diagnosis were described in this case.\nCould a disease affecting the nerves explain this patient\u2019s presentation? Congenital demye- linating conditions are unlikely, given the tempo of illness in this previously healthy infant. The Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is an acquired demye- linating syndrome that is typically associated with ascending weakness, a loss of reflexes, and an elevated CSF protein level without pleocytosis. Although this patient\u2019s CSF protein level was elevated, the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome is extremely rare in this age group.\nDiseases of the neuromuscular junction can also cause hypotonia. There was no reported maternal history of myasthenia gravis that would support the possibility of congenital myasthenia gravis. Transient forms of myasthenia gravis are extremely rare in infants. The Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome, a paraneoplastic process, is also quite rare in infants.\n\nBotulism\nInfant botulism is a disease of the neuromuscu- lar junction that fits very well with this patient\u2019s presentation. He had many of the associated signs and symptoms, including irritability, con- stipation, features of bulbar palsies (a weak cry, ptosis in both eyes, and poor feeding), lethargy, weakness, and respiratory difficulties.4 Patients with infant botulism typically present with mani- festations at 2 to 26 weeks of age. Although in- fant botulism is known to be associated with honey ingestion, most patients do not have a re- ported honey exposure; the disease is more likely to result from environmental factors.5\nThere is one aspect of this patient\u2019s presentation that would not be explained by a diagnosis of infant botulism: the elevated CSF protein level. An elevated CSF protein level is a feature of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and the patient had other findings consistent with this condition, including ascending weakness and a loss of reflexes. However, the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome tends to be diagnosed in older children, whereas approximately 95% of confirmed cases of botu- lism occur in patients younger than 6 months of age.5 An alternative explanation for the elevated CSF protein level is a traumatic lumbar puncture, which occurs with 10 to 30% of attempted lum- bar punctures and could also explain the elevat- ed red-cell count in the CSF in this patient.6\nOverall, I favor a diagnosis of infant botulism. I would send a stool specimen to be tested for Clostridium botulinum toxin type A and would ini- tiate empirical treatment with human-derived anti\u2013botulism toxin antibodies (infant botu- lism immune globulin, known as BabyBIG) while awaiting the test results.\n",

Further clinical history was also obtained.\nOn further interviewing, the patient\u2019s family members reported that he typically had hard stools every 2 to 3 days. Two days before admis- sion, the infant appeared to have abdominal dis- comfort, which his family members presumed was from constipation or gas. Honey was given to try to soothe him.\nReal-time polymerase-chain-reaction testing performed at the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health was positive for the gene encoding C. botulinum toxin type A. This test result confirmed the diagnosis of infant botulism.\n",
