    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Emily W. Lopes: A 53-year-old woman with celiac disease was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital for the management of upper gastroin- testinal bleeding with hemorrhagic shock.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 3 weeks before the current presentation, when fatigue, malaise, anorexia, generalized weak- ness, and watery diarrhea developed. Two weeks later, the diarrhea increased in frequency and became bloody. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 63/32 mm Hg, the hemoglobin level 6.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the international normalized ratio 7.63 (reference range, 0.90 to 1.10), the creatinine level 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.5 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [44 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), the alkaline phosphatase level 330 U per liter (reference range, 56 to 136), the albumin level 1.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.5), and the lactate level 3.3 mmol per liter (30 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to 18 mg per deciliter]). Normal saline, albumin, norepinephrine, fresh- frozen plasma, vitamin K, 4 units of packed red cells, vancomycin, piperacillin\u2013 tazobactam, octreotide, and pantoprazole were administered intravenously. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of oral contrast material, reportedly revealed ground-glass opacities in the lungs, pulmonary nodules, esophageal dilatation, and diffuse osteo- penia, along with ascites, hepatic steatosis, diffuse bowel-wall thickening, dilated loops of small bowel, and horseshoe kidney. A heterogeneous mass, measuring 11 cm by 8 cm by 7 cm, with internal necrosis was identified near the pancreatic tail. Abdominal ultrasonography reportedly showed a cirrhotic-appearing liver and ascites. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was reportedly notable for severe esophagitis but showed no source of acute bleeding.\nDuring the first 7 hospital days, diarrhea con- tinued, with an output of up to 2 liters of green liquid stool daily. Examination of a stool speci- men was reportedly positive for leukocytes and negative for Clostridioides difficile and Shiga toxin, as well as campylobacter, giardia, and cryptospo- ridium antigens.\nOn hospital day 7, anuria occurred, and the bladder pressure was 23 mm Hg. Paracentesis was performed for the treatment of abdominal distention, and 3.7 liters of ascitic fluid was re- moved. Testing of the ascitic fluid revealed 14,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 91 neu- trophils per microliter. The albumin level in as- citic fluid was 0.3 g per deciliter; the concurrent serum albumin level was 3.2 g per deciliter. No organisms were detected on Gram\u2019s staining of the ascitic fluid. Norepinephrine and albumin were administered intravenously.\nThe next day, there was an output of copious black stool. The hemoglobin level decreased from 8.1 g per deciliter to 5.1 g per deciliter; addi- tional norepinephrine was administered intrave- nously, along with 4 units of packed red cells, cryoprecipitate, vitamin K, and fresh-frozen plas- ma. Intubation of the trachea was performed for repeat EGD, which reportedly revealed a pulsatile vascular lesion in the distal esophagus; blood was detected around the lesion. Octreotide and pantoprazole were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by helicopter to the ICU of this hospital.\nBecause the patient had undergone intuba- tion, the medical history was initially obtained from her husband and was limited. Celiac dis- ease had been diagnosed in her late 30s, but she did not follow a gluten-free diet. Her one preg- nancy had been complicated by severe gestational hypertension, with delivery by cesarean section performed at 33 weeks\u2019 gestation. Menopause had occurred in her mid-40s. Recurrent otitis media had led to tympanic membrane perfora- tion and resultant chronic hearing loss. In the past year, she had lost 7 kg of weight uninten- tionally. In the 2 weeks before she was admitted to the other hospital, after the onset of diarrhea, she had had a decreased appetite and had eaten only candy and cereal, with 2 kg of weight loss. The patient attended college and worked as a technical consultant. She lived with her husband.\n \nShe had no history of nicotine, alcohol, or illicit substance use. She took no medications or sup- plements, and there were no known adverse re- actions to medications. Her family history in- cluded stroke in her father, colon cancer in her paternal grandfather, and pancreatic cancer in a paternal great-grandfather and a paternal aunt. She had an adult child, who was healthy.\nOn examination in the ICU, the patient ap- peared chronically ill. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 91 beats per minute, the  blood  pressure  102/67  mm  Hg,  and  the  re- spiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 98% while she was receiving mechanical ventilation on a spontaneous-breath- ing mode (positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; fraction of inspired oxygen, 35%). The height was 142 cm, the weight 50.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters)\n25.1. The bladder pressure was 12 mm Hg. The sclerae were icteric, and the skin was jaundiced. The corners of the mouth were inflamed, ery- thematous, and crusted. The abdomen was dis- tended, and a fluid wave was present. The palmar surfaces appeared mildly erythematous and de- nuded, and there were pigmented nevi on the back and shoulder. Symmetric 1+ pitting edema was observed in the lower legs.\nThe calcium and phosphorus levels were nor- mal. Tests for hepatitis A antibodies, hepatitis B surface antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigens, hepatitis B core antibodies, hepatitis C antibod- ies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and liver\u2013kidney\u2013microsomal autoantibodies type 1 were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Stool was obtained for culture and examination for ova and parasites. Albumin, 2 units of packed red cells, ceftriaxone, propofol, pantoprazole, and octreotide were administered intravenously.\nEGD was performed the next morning (Fig. 1).\nThere was a blind-ended submucosal pouch that suggested the possibility of an intramural dis- section in the posterior esophagus. Severe esoph- agitis, cratered esophageal ulcers, and a distal esophageal varix with an overlying fibrin plug were noted. An attempt at esophageal band ligation was unsuccessful, with unroofing of the fibrin clot and active spurting of blood. Two clips were applied for hemostasis. Hematin was found throughout the stomach. The duodenal bulb appeared nodular, and the duodenal mucosa appeared scalloped; a duodenal biopsy was per- formed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: CT angiography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed for assessment of the esophageal vessels and pos- sible esophageal perforation (Fig. 2). Multiple esophageal, perigastric, and perisplenic varices were present. A 1.8-cm esophageal diverticulum, pneumomediastinum, and foci of air in the ret- ropharyngeal space and other deep spaces of the neck were noted, along with diffuse hepatic steatosis (without morphologic features of cirrhosis),\nmild splenomegaly,  horseshoe kidney, and diffuse thickening of the small and large bowel walls. An enhancing, centrally hypodense left retroperitoneal mass, measuring 10.7 cm in greatest di- mension, was present. There was diffuse mottling of bones.\nDr. Lopes: In the first 24 hours of hospitaliza- tion, there was an output of 800 ml of red liquid stool. On hospital day 2, a total of 3 units of packed red cells were administered. On hospital day 3, transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function, aortic-valve scle- rosis, and mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgita- tion. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAdditional diagnostic tests were performed.\n\nTable 1.

A blind\u2011ended submucosal pouch suggests the possibility of an esophageal intramural dissection (Panel A). Severe esophagitis with ulceration is present (Panel B), along with a distal esophageal varix with an overlying fibrin plug (Panel C); the varix was flattened on insuffla\u2011 tion. The duodenum appears nodular and scalloped (Panel D).\n\nFigure 2. Delayed-Phase Images from CT Angiography.\nCT angiography of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material; delayed\u2011phase images are shown. An axial image at the level of the thyroid (Panel A) shows foci of air in the deep spaces of\nthe neck and a 1.8\u2011cm left lateral esophageal diverticulum (arrow). An axial image at the level of the upper thorax (Panel B) shows pneu\u2011 momediastinum adjacent to the fluid\u2011filled esophagus (arrow) and bilateral pleural effusions. An axial image at the level of the upper abdomen (Panel C) shows nodular, submucosal, enhancing foci in the distal esophagus that are compatible with varices (arrow), an en\u2011 doscopically placed clip, and ascites (also shown in Panels D, E, and F). An axial image at a slightly more caudal level of the upper abdo\u2011 men (Panel D) shows severe hepatic steatosis without morphologic features of cirrhosis, as well as splenomegaly. An axial image at the level of the mid\u2011abdomen (Panel E) shows horseshoe kidney (with bridging parenchyma across the midline), diffuse thickening of the small and large bowel walls, and a 10.7\u2011cm enhancing, centrally hypodense left retroperitoneal mass (arrow) anterior to the left renal moiety. A coronal image through the abdomen (Panel F) shows the left retroperitoneal mass (arrow), which is adjacent to, but separate from, the kidney (white arrowhead) and pancreas (black arrowhead).\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Nikroo Hashemi: This 53-year-old woman with celiac disease, who was not following a glutenfree diet, had appeared well until 3 weeks before the current presentation, when she began to have a large volume of watery diarrhea. After 2 weeks, the diarrhea became bloody, and she was admit- ted to another hospital. She was found to be in hemorrhagic shock and received intensive care and resuscitation. Severe coagulopathy and hypo- albuminemia were detected. Imaging reportedly revealed fatty liver, a large retroperitoneal mass, and horseshoe kidney. EGD reportedly showed no features of portal hypertension and no source of bleeding. However, the patient had portal hypertensive ascites that required drainage.\nAt the other hospital, the patient continued to have a large volume of diarrhea for a week, with- out an infectious cause. A second episode of bleed- ing then prompted repeat EGD, which reportedly showed a bleeding esophageal varix. The patient was transferred to this hospital. The presence of a bleeding esophageal varix was confirmed, and an esophageal tear that was probably due to trau- ma during previous EGD was noted. Severe nutri- tional deficiencies, including deficiencies in fat- soluble vitamins, and osteoporosis were detected. The liver steatosis and evidence of portal hyper- tension (varices, splenomegaly, and ascites) were confirmed on imaging. The constellation of fatty liver without morphologic features of cirrhosis, evidence of portal hypertension (including gas- troesophageal collateral vessels on CT and varices on endoscopy), and extrahepatic and intestinal findings in the history and on physical examina- tion and imaging suggests a syndromic diagnosis.\n\nFatty Liver\nMetabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) is a term that encompasses all disease grades and stages and is defined by the presence of macrovesicular steatosis in at least 5% of hepatocytes, in the absence of a readily identified alternative cause (e.g., medication, star- vation, or a monogenic disorder), in persons who drink little or no alcohol (<20 g per day for women and <30 g per day for men).1 This diagnosis is unlikely in a patient who does not have obesity or a metabolic syndrome. In addition, this patient does not drink alcohol, so the likelihood of fatty liver disease is decreased.\nThis patient has celiac disease, as well as iron and folate deficiencies and bone loss. In patients with celiac disease, the most common manifes- tation of liver injury (known as \u201cceliac hepatitis\u201d) involves elevated levels of alanine aminotrans- ferase and aspartate aminotransferase and mild, nonspecific changes on liver biopsy.2,3 Celiac dis- ease is present in 2.2 to 7.9% of patients who have fatty liver and a normal BMI.4 There is an increased risk of MASLD (hazard ratio, 2.8) among patients with celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet.5,6 MASLD occurs in more than one third of patients with celiac disease who fol- low a gluten-free diet, as compared with 21.8% of patients without celiac disease, and the increased risk persists more than 15 years after celiac dis- ease is diagnosed.6 This patient has not followed a gluten-free diet and has normal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, so her presentation would not be explained by celiac disease alone.\nSymptomatic Wilson\u2019s disease can develop at any age. Adults with this disease may have con- current neuropsychiatric symptoms. Although this patient has a level of alkaline phosphatase that could be compatible with Wilson\u2019s disease,7 she has normal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In addition, she predominantly has fatty liver and portal hyper- tension, rather than acute liver failure or decom- pensated cirrhosis. Her low ceruloplasmin level is probably caused by an absolute copper deficiency that is related to diarrhea in the context of celiac disease.\nPersons who are homozygous for familial\nhypobetalipoproteinemia have fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, as well as gastrointestinal and neuro- logic dysfunction. Fatty liver usually occurs in the presence of additional risk factors, such as obe- sity, hyperinsulinemia, or a high-fat diet.8\n\nPortal Hypertension in the Absence of Cirrhosis\nPortosinusoidal vascular disorder (PSVD), which is a new term for noncirrhotic portal hyperten- sion, is defined by the presence of clinical signs of portal hypertension and the absence of cir- rhosis on liver biopsy.9 Variceal bleeding is a common first manifestation of PSVD.10 In most patients with PSVD, hepatic synthetic function is normal until late in the disease course. This patient had coagulopathy, but it was corrected with the administration of clotting factors and vitamin K, so it was more likely to be related to nutritional deficiency than to hepatic synthetic dysfunction. In patients with PSVD, levels of liver enzymes and the hepatic venous pressure gradi- ent are normal or mildly elevated. PSVD can be related to numerous conditions, including infec- tions, drug or toxin exposures, prothrombotic disorders, immunologic disorders, and genetic disorders. On the basis of this patient\u2019s history and presentation, the list of possible causes of PSVD can be narrowed to immunologic and ge- netic disorders.\nImmunologic causes of PSVD that are rele-\nvant in this patient include celiac disease. It is postulated that, in patients with celiac disease, extraintestinal manifestations may be explained by aberrant immune activity triggered by expo- sure to gluten.11 Another immunologic cause of PSVD is hypogammaglobulinemia. This patient\n \n\nhas had recurrent otitis media but no other in- fections that would suggest this diagnosis. Ge- netic causes include the Marfan syndrome and the Turner syndrome. This patient has several fea- tures consistent with the Turner syndrome, in- cluding short stature, recurrent otitis media, pig- mented nevi, and congenital heart and kidney malformations, including aortic sclerosis and horseshoe kidney. The risk of autoimmune dis- eases among patients with the Turner syndrome is approximately twice as high as the risk in the general female population.12 Specifically, the inci- dence of celiac disease among patients with the Turner syndrome is increased by a factor of 11.13\n\nTurner Syndrome and Liver Disease\nThe Turner syndrome is associated with a wide spectrum of liver injuries, especially in older pa- tients. These include steatosis, steatofibrosis, and steatohepatitis, all of which are commonly related to being overweight.14 In some patients, congeni- tally abnormal vessels cause marked architectural changes in the liver that are associated with a risk of severe liver-related complications. Such changes include obliterative portal venopathy, ab- normal hepatic microvasculature, local hepatic hypoxia, compensatory hyperplasia (including nodular regenerative hyperplasia, which can cause portal hypertension), multiple focal nodular hy- perplasia, or cirrhosis.15\nFinally, the presence of a large retroperito-\nneal mass in this patient expands the differen- tial diagnosis to include neuroendocrine tumors. Persistence of a large volume of watery diar- rhea, despite fasting and a stool osmotic gap of 80 mOsm per kilogram (the level is >100 mOsm per kilogram in patients with osmotic diarrhea related to celiac disease), is not a typical feature of celiac disease alone and suggests a secretory component. However, secretory diarrhea related to a neuroendocrine tumor usually occurs with a gastrointestinal primary cancer or liver metas- tases. Another possible explanation of the retro- peritoneal mass is nonfunctioning paragangli- onoma. It is notable that the Turner syndrome is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers.16,17\nIn this case, I suspect that a transjugular\nintrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) was placed for the management of variceal bleeding. I would obtain pressure measurements and perform a transjugular liver biopsy, as well as an imaging- guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass and karyotyping.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Jinesa Moodley: Examination of a biopsy speci- men obtained from the duodenum and duodenal bulb (Fig. 3A and 3B) revealed moderate villous blunting of the duodenal mucosa. The lamina propria was expanded by a dense lymphoplasma- cytic infiltrate. In the overlying surface epitheli- um, there was a marked increase in intraepithe- lial lymphocytes, which were positive for CD3 and CD8 and negative for CD4. On the basis of the Marsh\u2013Oberhuber classification, these find- ings are consistent with a type 3b lesion (defined by >30 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 entero- cytes, increased crypt hyperplasia, and marked villous atrophy). In the appropriate clinical and serologic context, these histologic features are highly supportive of a diagnosis of celiac disease. Examination of a liver-biopsy specimen (Fig.\n3C and 3D) revealed diffuse steatosis with medi-\num-sized fat droplets that were uniformly dis- tributed throughout the entire hepatic lobule. The hepatocytes had features of regeneration, with rare mitotic figures and thickened hepatic plates seen on reticulin staining. Mild periductal edema was present with a bile ductal reaction and a periductal neutrophilic infiltrate, findings consistent with neutrophilic cholangiolitis. Immu- nohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 7 con- firmed the ductal reaction. Native bile ducts were intact and normal. Given the brisk neutrophilic infiltrate, immunohistochemical staining for in- fectious causes (e.g., cytomegalovirus and spiro- chetes) was performed, and the staining was nega- tive. Pertinent negative findings included the absence of pathologic fibrosis, iron, and copper. Periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining with diastase diges- tion revealed no positive globules. Despite the thickened hepatic plates seen on reticulin stain- ing, no diagnostic features of nodular regenera- tive hyperplasia or cirrhosis were identified.\nA biopsy specimen of the left retroperitoneal\nlesion (Fig. 3E) showed diffuse growth of round- to-ovoid monomorphic cells that were arranged in an organoid-to-nested pattern with dispersed chromatin. No atypia, mitotic activity, or necro- sis were identified. Immunohistochemical stain- ing for the neuroendocrine markers synaptophy- sin and chromogranin was diffusely positive. Staining for GATA3 was positive in nuclei, as was staining for succinate dehydrogenase B subunit (SDHB). Very rare cells were positive for cyto- keratins 34\u03b2E12 and AE1\u2013AE3. Immunohisto- chemical staining was negative for S100, HMB45, DOG1, MNF116, CDX2, PAX8, and MDM2.  The\noverall  histomorphologic  and immunopheno-\ntypic features were most compatible with a diag- nosis of paraganglioma.\nA liver-biopsy specimen that contained a peri- capsular liver lesion (Fig. 3F) showed no hepatic parenchyma. There was a spindle-cell neoplasm composed of long wavy nuclei that were arranged in alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas. The hypocellular areas had a loose myxoid appear- ance. The hypercellular areas had nuclear palisad- ing that was indicative of Verocay bodies. No atypia, mitotic activity, or necrosis was identi- fied. The tumor cells were diffusely positive for S100 and negative for desmin. The histomorpho- logic and immunophenotypic features were diag- nostic of a schwannoma.\n\nDr. Angela E. Lin: The Turner syndrome was sus- pected in this 53-year-old woman on the basis of her short stature, horseshoe kidney, and charac- teristic facial features (mild ptosis, subjective hy- pertelorism, maxillary hypoplasia, and mildly low set pinnae with adherent lobules) in the context of acute variceal bleeding and celiac disease.21 A feature observed in this patient that is uncom- mon in patients with the nonmosaic form of the Turner syndrome is ovarian sufficiency, as shown by a history of spontaneous puberty and menses at 15 years of age, spontaneous pregnancy, and menopause in her mid-40s. However, severe ges- tational hypertension, premature delivery, and low birth weight are frequent complications of preg- nancy in patients with the Turner syndrome.22-25 A chromosomal analysis of peripheral white cells, performed at a hospital affiliated with this hos- pital, revealed the nonmosaic 45,X karyotype in this patient. With counting of 30 cells (meta- phases), 46,XX mosaicism greater than 14% was ruled out.26\nWhen the diagnosis of the Turner syndrome\nis delayed into adulthood, the reason may be physicians\u2019 lack of familiarity with the mild or unusual clinical features of the broad pheno- type. Physicians are generally aware of the more distinctive features that may occur in fetuses, infants, or children, including fetal hydrops, postnatal lymphedema, nuchal webbing, charac- teristic facial features (prominent ears, retrogna- thia, a small mouth, ptosis, and epicanthal folds), coarctation of the aorta and other congenital defects involving the left side of the heart, hear- ing loss, delayed puberty, and academic and so- cial challenges.21,27-29 A chromosomal analysis of peripheral white cells is indicated when a key clinical feature such as short stature is present, whether as the sole feature or in combination with others. The nonmosaic 45,X karyotype is de- tected in approximately 40% of patients with the Turner syndrome. Fetal loss in 99% of concep- tuses led to the hypothesis that live births with a seemingly complete nonmosaic karyotype (45,X) have some degree of mosaicism (46,XX), even if it is undetected.30,31 Testing of tissue specimens, such as skin, buccal cells, or bladder epithelium, could be offered to complement peripheral-blood testing.\n\n",
