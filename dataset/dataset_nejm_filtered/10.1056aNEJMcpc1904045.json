    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Elinor L. Baron: A 45-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis, seronegative inflam- matory polyarthritis, and migraine was admitted to this hospital during the winter because of lethargy and decreased verbal output.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 13 days before this ad- mission, when a severe headache developed. The pain began insidiously, was pounding in quality, and radiated from the occiput to the retro-orbital area and forehead. The onset of pain coincided with visual aura, including blurring of the peripheral vision and oscillating flashes of light. The headache was reminiscent of the patient\u2019s previous migraine headaches, the last of which had occurred more than 10 years earlier; symptoms had typically abated with butalbital\u2013acetaminophen\u2013 caffeine therapy.\nFive days later, and 8 days before this admission, symptoms worsened, and the patient sought care at the emergency department at another hospital. On arrival, she reported photophobia, nausea, and vomiting; she had no history of head injury, and she reported no neck pain, fever, chills, numbness, tingling, weakness, or dizziness. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the pulse 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 147/98 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared uncomfortable and was lying in bed in a dark room with her eyes covered. She was alert, oriented, and able to follow commands. Her neck was supple. Ptosis and miosis of the left eye were noted; the neurologic examination was otherwise normal. The hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and blood levels of elec- trolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the results of kidney- function and liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the head showed no evidence of an acute intra- cranial process, and there was a finding suggestive of an inferior basal ganglia cyst that appeared unchanged from that seen on imaging that had been performed 5 years earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance arteriography of the head and neck revealed stable, scattered demyelinating plaques; no active demyelinating lesions were seen, and there was no evidence of venous sinus thrombosis or cavernous sinus thrombosis. The  patient received intravenous  f luids, ondansetron, diphenhydramine, meto- clopramide, magnesium sulfate, and morphine, but the headache persisted. Intravenous hydro- morphone, ketorolac, and methylprednisolone were subsequently administered, which led to a moderate reduction in pain. The patient was dis- charged home and was instructed to take diclo- fenac and oral methylprednisolone for 5 days.\nOne day after discharge, and 5 days before admission to this hospital, the headache and nausea recurred, along with intermittent episodes of vomiting. Four days before this admission, lethargy, disorientation, and decreased verbal output developed. The patient was able to follow commands, but verbal responses to questions were limited to \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d She had no fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, dizziness, loss of consciousness, convulsive move- ments, incontinence, facial droop, or slurred speech. The patient was taken by ambulance to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the patient was alert but confused. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 110 beats per minute, the blood pressure 160/110 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. She was able to fol- low commands, and the neurologic examination was unchanged from the previous examination. Levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver- function tests; a urine toxicology screen was positive for cannabinoids. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. CT of the head was unchanged from the CT performed 3 days ear- lier, and a chest radiograph was normal. Intrave- nous ketorolac, famotidine, and pantoprazole were administered, and the patient was admitted\nto the other hospital.\nThe next morning, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.0\u00b0C developed. Repeat MRI of the head revealed no notable change from the previ- ous MRI. A lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 28 cm of water, and 6 ml of clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was removed. The results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Testing of the CSF for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalopathy was performed. Specimens of blood, urine, and CSF were obtained for culture, and the patient received empirical intravenous acyclovir, vancomycin, and meropenem. That eve- ning, nuchal rigidity was noted. During the next 3 days, the patient\u2019s mental status waxed and waned but was persistently poor overall, and she had a fever with a temperature of up to 39.0\u00b0C. She was transferred to the neurology service of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital,\nher husband reported that her verbal output had increased since admission to the other hospital, such that responses to questions now included words and phrases. The patient had a history of multiple sclerosis, which had been stable for many years with treatment with rituximab. She had seronegative inflammatory polyarthritis with progressive symptoms, despite increased use of immunosuppressive therapies. She also had a history of hypertension, depression, anxiety, and melanoma. An episode of sinusitis had occurred 10 weeks before admission to this hospital and had resolved after the administration of doxycy- cline. She had undergone an extended carpal tunnel release of the right wrist and radical flexor tenosynovectomy for inflammatory flexor tenosynovitis. Medications before admission in- cluded rituximab, hydroxychloroquine (started 18 months before admission), leflunomide (started 11 months before admission), methylprednisolone (started 18 months before admission), butalbital\u2013 acetaminophen\u2013caffeine combination tablets, diclofenac, hydrocodone\u2013acetaminophen, inhaled albuterol, duloxetine, bupropion, quetiapine, trazo- done, lisinopril, nifedipine, cholecalciferol, and folic acid. She was allergic to penicillin, levo- floxacin, cephalosporins, and sulfonamide-con- taining medications.\nThe patient was married and had three school-age children; she lived with her family in a suburban community in New England and spent summers on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts. She was receiving disability benefits and spent most of her time indoors. There was no recent history of travel. She had a healthy dog. She had smoked 10 cigarettes daily for 7 years and had quit 22 years before this admission. She drank alcoholic beverages in moderation and reported no use of illicit drugs. Her mother had had coronary artery disease, diabetes, and migraine; her father had had hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and multiple sclerosis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the blood pressure 106/65  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  18  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was awake, alert, and oriented to her name. The sclerae and conjunctivae were clear, and the pupils were symmetric and reactive, with no af- ferent pupillary defect. Repetitive blinking and squinting in the left eye were noted, but there was no definite ptosis or facial droop. No oro- pharyngeal exudates were present, and there was no erythema. Mild resistance to neck f lexion was noted. The lungs were clear. There were ul- cers on the distal fingers, but no rashes were noted. Muscle tone and strength were normal, as was sensation to light touch. Reflexes were nor- mal, and there was no startle myoclonus; a mild postural tremor was seen. The patient wrote \u201cmagical\u201d when asked to write her name. She was able to follow simple, but not complex, com- mands. Laboratory testing revealed a blood sodium level of 133 mmol per liter (reference range,135 to 145). The levels of other electrolytes,glucose, creatine kinase, and lactic acid were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 anti- gen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Bacterial cultures of the blood, urine, and CSF that were obtained at the other hospital before the initiation of antibiotic agents were negative, as was testing of the CSF for autoanti- bodies.bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral hippocampi, splenium of the corpus callosum, and periven- tricular white matter that corresponded to areas of restricted diffusion (Fig. 2).\n\nTable 1.

Buch: On admission to this hospi- tal, MRI of the head, performed after the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle leptomeningeal enhancement in the pos- terior fossa. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inver- sion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the sulci of the temporal and occipital lobes, as well as signal hyperintensity in the right posterior periatrial region that cor- responded with a punctate focus of restricted diffusion (Fig. 1).\nDr. Baron: Empirical treatment with doxycycline was initiated, and the administration of intra- venous acyclovir and meropenem was continued. A repeat lumbar puncture was performed, and the results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. During the subsequent 2 days, the patient\u2019s men- tal status remained poor. An electroencephalo- gram showed diffuse theta slowing in the back- ground, with no epileptiform activity. The next day, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.6\u00b0C developed, along with loss of all verbal output and an inconsistent ability to follow commands. Dr. Buch: Follow-up MRI of the head, per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed the presence of new hydrocephalus, progressive and extensive lepto- meningeal enhancement, and abnormal enhance- ment in the choroid plexus and ependyma of the lateral ventricles.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Allan R. Tunkel: This patient, who has been immunocompromised as a result of treatment with methylprednisolone and rituximab, presents with signs and symptoms of acute meningo- encephalitis. Her general laboratory studies are not particularly remarkable. Lumbar puncture reveals an elevated opening pressure, and the CSF analysis is notable for mononuclear pleo- cytosis, a normal glucose level, and an elevated protein level. MRI of the head reveals diffuse pachymeningeal and leptomeningeal enhance- ment, sulcal hyperintensity in the basal cisterns and cerebellum on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging, increased ventricular size, and a solitary 5-mm lesion in the splenium with restricted diffusion and no enhancement. Despite treatment with vancomycin, meropenem, acyclovir, and doxycy- cline, the patient has had progressive deteriora- tion, a finding that may be helpful in determining a specific cause for the acute meningoencepha- litis.\n\nNoninfectious Causes of Acute Meningoencephalitis\nCSF testing for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalopathy was reported to be negative; although no infor- mation is available with respect to which specific tests were performed, I will rule out the possibil- ity of autoimmune and paraneoplastic encepha- lopathy on the basis of this report. Carcinoma- tous meningitis should be considered, given the patient\u2019s history of melanoma; however, there are no details regarding the extent of disease, and if the patient had carcinomatous meningitis, I would have expected a more long-term presentation. Migraine or migrainelike syndromes can cause a lymphocytic meningitis, but this would not be expected to progress to meningoencephalitis. Certain medications can cause meningitis, with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs being the most notable; although this patient has been treated with diclofenac, her symptoms began be- fore initiation of therapy.\nInfectious Causes of Meningoencephalitis\nProtozoa\nCertain protozoa can cause amebic meningoen- cephalitis. Acanthamoeba species cause disease in immunocompromised patients, and Balamuthia mandrillaris can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. However, these organisms usually cause a granulomatous menin- goencephalitis, with single or multiple enhanc- ing lesions visible on MRI; such imaging findings are not present in this case. Infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan that can cause a nonfocal encephalitis in patients who are not infected with HIV, should be considered in any immunocompromised patient who presents with encephalitis.\nFungi\nFungal meningoencephalitis is usually subacute or chronic. A diagnosis of an endemic mycosis (histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, or coccidioido- mycosis) is unlikely in this patient, given that she has no history of exposure or travel to a re- gion in which such mycoses are endemic. Infec- tion with Cryptococcus neoformans must be consid- ered in this case, given her long-term treatment with methylprednisolone, and this entity should be ruled out by CSF testing for cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen.\n\nBacteria\nBacterial meningitis should always be considered in any patient who presents with acute meningo- encephalitis. The most common cause in this context is Streptococcus pneumoniae, but CSF find- ings usually include a neutrophilic pleocytosis, a low glucose level, and an elevated protein level.\nS. pneumoniae and most other causes of commu- nity-acquired bacterial meningitis would respond to an antimicrobial regimen, such as that ad- ministered to this patient. However, infection with Listeria monocytogenes is possible; listeria meningitis is more common among immuno- compromised persons than among immunocom- petent persons.1 Biologic therapies have been associated with the development of listeria men- ingitis. In one review of 266 reported cases of listeria meningitis in patients receiving biologic therapies, most patients (77%) had been treated with infliximab, but 4% had received rituximab therapy, as had this patient.2 Atypical CSF find- ings have also been reported in patients with listeria meningitis; in one report, 23% of pa- tients had no individual CSF findings that were indicative of bacterial meningitis.3 Meropenem has been used successfully to treat listeriosis, which makes this diagnosis unlikely, although treatment failure associated with meropenem has been described.\nGiven the patient\u2019s location, in New England, other bacteria should also be considered. Infec- tion with Anaplasma phagocytophilum is possible, but there is no evidence of leukopenia, thrombo- cytopenia, or elevated blood aminotransferase levels, thereby making this diagnosis unlikely. Infection with a spirochete, such as Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferi, or B. miyamotoi, may be possible, but this patient received therapies that would have been effective against these organisms. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is important to consider, given the patient\u2019s immunocompro- mised state, lack of response to antimicrobial therapy, and MRI findings of basilar meningitis, hydrocephalus, and diffuse pachymeningitis; how- ever, most patients with tuberculous meningitis have a low CSF glucose level, and this patient\u2019s level was not low on admission to this hospital.\n\nViruses\nDoes this patient have a viral infection that is causing acute meningoencephalitis? I would rule out the viruses that are arthropod-borne. The mosquito-borne viruses that can cause disease in the northeastern United States \u2014 West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, La Crosse vi- rus, and eastern equine encephalitis virus \u2014 would all be unlikely, given the patient\u2019s presen- tation in winter, when mosquitoes are not active in this region of the country because of cold temperatures. Tickborne Powassan virus is pos- sible but also unlikely, even though tickborne infections can occur in winter. Ticks are general- ly inactive if the air temperature falls below 2\u00b0C; however, if the ground is not covered by snow and the soil temperature reaches 7\u00b0C, ticks will search for blood hosts, and Ixodes scapularis re- mains active if the temperature is above freezing. The herpes viruses are important causes of meningoencephalitis. However, this patient\u2019s pro- gression of disease while receiving intravenous acyclovir makes herpes simplex viruses and varicella\u2013zoster virus unlikely. Epstein\u2013Barr virus is possible, although cerebellar ataxia and cranial- nerve palsies are usually present with this virus. Cytomegalovirus can cause central nervous sys- tem disease, most often in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but it is usually associated with evidence of widespread disease. Human herpesvirus 6 can cause disease in immunocompromised adults but is usually seen in patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.\nInfluenza viruses can cause an acute enceph- alopathy syndrome, such as acute necrotizing encephalopathy,4,5 but such a condition is rare in adults and usually does not cause CSF pleocyto- sis; there is also no evidence of previous or concomitant respiratory tract symptoms in this patient. JC virus, which causes progressive mul- tifocal leukoencephalopathy, has been reported in patients receiving rituximab6,7; however, the MRI findings in this patient are not consistent with this diagnosis, and affected patients usually do not have clinically significant CSF pleocyto- sis. The nonpolio enteroviruses (e.g., echovirus and coxsackievirus) can cause meningoencephalitis, but their presence would be unusual in the win- ter months, because the disease is more typical in late summer and early fall. Chronic enterovi- ral meningoencephalitis has been reported in patients treated with rituximab,8,9 given that pro- longed rituximab therapy can produce B-cell deficiency leading to hypogammaglobulinemia. However, this entity is exceedingly rare and is usually associated with a more long-term pre-sentation.\nFinally, I would consider adenovirus meningo-\nencephalitis as a possible diagnosis. Adenoviruses can cause meningitis or meningoencephalitis as a primary infection or as a complication of sys- temic or respiratory infection in immunocom- promised adults. Adenovirus is a rare cause of meningoencephalitis, especially given its associa- tion with diseases of the respiratory and gastro- intestinal tracts and the fact that meningoenceph- alitis occurs more commonly as a complication of severe pneumonia.\nAfter considering the most common causes of meningoencephalitis in this patient, adenovirus infection is the most likely diagnosis by process of elimination. This would not be a viral infec- tion that I would usually consider in this clinical scenario, but it might have been considered by the treating physicians, especially if adenovirus was identified in another clinical specimen (e.g., from the respiratory tract). The diagnosis of ade- novirus meningoencephalitis could be confirmed by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test of blood or CSF. Although the diagnosis may also be established by culture, CSF viral cultures are generally not recommended in patients who present with meningoencephalitis.10\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Adenovirus meningoencephalitis.",
    "Diagnosis": "Adenovirus (serotype 2) meningoencephalitis",
    "Key testing": "",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Baron: After approximately 8 days of incuba- tion, the viral culture of CSF that was obtained during the initial lumbar puncture at the other hospital grew adenovirus type 2. Once this re- sult was obtained, PCR testing of CSF, blood, and urine for adenovirus was performed; all the tests were positive. On the day that the result of the CSF viral culture became known, the patient received one dose of cidofovir (5 mg per kilo- gram of body weight). She was also treated with intravenous immune globulin (0.5 mg per kilo- gram per day for 5 days), which was expected to have high levels of neutralizing antibodies against common serotypes of adenovirus. Despite the use of these therapies, the patient\u2019s clinical status continued to decline. An application for the use of brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral drug, was submitted through an expanded-access pro- tocol based on the hypothesis that brincidofovir might have higher central nervous system pene- tration than cidofovir. While the patient awaited the arrival of brincidofovir from the pharmaceu- tical company, her condition continued to deteri- orate. On the 10th hospital day, the follow-up MRI of the head was performed.\nGiven the patient\u2019s profound neurologic defi-\ncits and worsening findings on imaging studies, she was transitioned to comfort measures only, and on the 12th hospital day, she died peace- fully. An autopsy was performed.\nDr. Maria Martinez-Lage: On postmortem exami- nation, the brain weighed 1260 g (reference range, 1250 to 1400). There was congestion of the lepto- meningeal vessels and mild focal gray opacifica- tion of the subarachnoid space (Fig. 3A). The corpus callosum was friable and necrotic (Fig. 3A). Coronal sections of the hemispheres showed scattered, sharply demarcated gray lesions in the periventricular and deep white matter, findings that were consistent with demyelinating plaques. Ill-defined, bilateral, somewhat symmetric areas of softening and necrosis were present in the corpus callosum, centrum semiovale, hippo- campi, cerebellar dentate nuclei, and basis pon- tis (Fig. 3B). The choroid plexus was prominent in the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and the ependymal lining was focally disrupted.\nOn microscopic examination, there was exten- sive mononuclear inflammation with microglial nodules involving the cerebral white matter, neo- cortex, pyramidal layer of the hippocampus, and cerebellar dentate nuclei (Fig. 3C), as well as all examined levels of the brain stem and spinal cord. Patchy infiltrates were seen in the sub- arachnoid space and spinal roots. In some regions, including the corpus callosum and cho- roid plexus (Fig. 3D), the lesions were frankly destructive, with numerous foamy macrophages. Nuclear inclusions were not readily identified. The lymphocytic infiltrates were composed predominantly of CD3+ T cells, with perivascular and parenchymal distribution (Fig. 3E). Immuno- histochemical staining for CD163 highlighted abundant microglial nodules, activated microglia, and macrophages (Fig. 3F). Immunohistochemical staining for adenovirus was negative; how- ever, electron microscopy of a paraffin-embedded tissue block revealed many nonenveloped icosa- hedral intracellular viral particles with an aver- age diameter of 81.5 nm, findings that were consistent with adenovirus (Fig. 3G and 3H). The result of immunohistochemical staining was considered to be false negative, potentially owing to sampling.\nThe general autopsy revealed evidence of nec- rotizing interstitial nephritis and focal enteritis, and immunohistochemical staining for adenovi- rus was positive. No other organs, including the lungs and liver, were involved.\nThe findings are consistent with an adeno- viral meningoencephalomyelitis (with associated adenoviral nephritis and enteritis), in conjunction with multiple sclerosis. Adenovirus encephalitis is extremely rare and is seen almost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts.11\nAmong the more than 50 serotypes of adeno- virus, serotype 2 (which was identified in this patient) is the most common serotype that has been reported to be associated with meningoen- cephalitis and disseminated disease.12,13 Pub- lished reports of the neuropathological features of adenovirus meningoencephalitis are scarce,14,15 but reported cases show bilateral, sometimes sym- metric, necrotizing lesions with a striking predi- lection for medial and paramedian structures (e.g., the mesial temporal lobe,16 basal forebrain,17 and brain stem15) and the ventricular system.18 Lymphocytic infiltrates, microglial nodules, and intranuclear inclusions are the most common microscopic findings, although intranuclear in- clusions were not a salient feature in this case. Involvement of the spinal cord and roots, as seen in this patient, has been reported in a sin- gle case.19\n\nFigure 3. Autopsy Specimens of the Brain.\nPanel A shows congestion of the leptomeningeal vessels and mild focal gray opacification of the subarachnoid space (white arrow); the corpus callosum is friable and necrotic (black arrow). In Panel B, ill-defined, bilateral, somewhat symmetric areas of softening and necrosis are present in the corpus callosum, centrum semiovale, hippocampi, cerebellar dentate nuclei (black oval), and basis pontis (white oval). In Panel C, hematoxylin and eosin staining shows extensive mononuclear inflammation involving the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, with microglial nodules present in both gray and white matter (inset). This pattern of inflammation was widespread, involving multiple locations. In Panel D, hematoxylin and eosin staining shows the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, where there is evidence of necro- sis, with numerous foamy macrophages and cellular debris (arrow indicates residual choroid plexus lining). Panels E and F show immu- nohistochemical staining for CD3 and CD163, respectively, in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (the same region shown in Panel A). The lymphocytic infiltrates are composed predominantly of CD3+ T cells, with perivascular and parenchymal distribution (Panel E; inset shows a microglial nodule in proximity to residual neurons). Abundant microglial nodules, activated microglia, and macrophages can be seen (Panel F; inset shows a microglial nodule). In Panels G and H, electron microscopy of a paraffin-embedded tissue block of the mid- brain reveals icosahedral intracellular viral particles with an average diameter of 81.5 nm, findings that are consistent with adenovirus.\n",
