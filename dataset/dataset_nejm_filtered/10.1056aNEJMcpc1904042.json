    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Marcus T. Altman (Medicine): A 26-year-old woman with a history of migraines was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital during the winter because of headache.\nThree weeks before this presentation, the patient had traveled with her family to Europe for vacation. Nineteen days before this presentation, she visited a moun- tainous region, where she stayed in a mountain cabin and spent time outdoors in the snow. The cabin was located at an altitude above 3400 m. While in the moun- tains, she struck her head during a low-velocity sledding accident, after which she had a headache that lasted several hours and resolved spontaneously. She also had had mild chills and cough that she had attributed to spending time in cold weather. Eight days before this presentation, a severe headache, which the patient de- scribed as the worst headache of her life, developed suddenly while she was eating dinner. The pain, located in the bitemporal regions and the occiput, was associ- ated with fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Unlike the patient\u2019s typical migraine headaches, the headache did not abate with either acetaminophen or naproxen\ntherapy.\nFive days before this presentation, neck stiffness and decreased range of motion in the neck developed. The patient was evaluated at a local emergency department, where she received a diagnosis of recurrent migraine; intravenous fluid and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were administered. She was able to continue traveling with her family, but severe headache persisted, which prompted her to return early to the United States.\nOne day before this presentation, the patient arrived at the Boston airport and was taken to the emergency department of another hospital. She reported ongoing severe headache and sensitivity to light and noise and a 1-week history of intermit- tent fever, chills, and night sweats, as well as constipation that had lasted several days. On examination, the temperature was 37\u00b0C, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the blood pressure 119/83 mm Hg, the respira- tory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was alert, awake, and appeared comfortable. The neck was supple, with full range of motion. No cervical lymphadenopathy or neurologic abnormalities were noted. After in- travenous ketorolac, diphenhydramine, and meto- clopramide were administered, there was a mod- erate decrease in the headache pain. Oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen were subsequently prescribed, and she was discharged home with instructions to contact her primary care physi- cian if her symptoms did not resolve.\nThe next morning, the patient awoke with ongoing severe headache, nausea, and vomiting and presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. There was no weight loss, sore throat, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, dysuria, rash, or mucocutaneous ul- cers. Family members who had traveled with her had not had similar symptoms.\nThe patient had had varicella virus infection in childhood. She was originally from South Amer- ica but had immigrated to the United States more than 15 years earlier. She was married, lived with her husband in a suburban region of New England, and worked in the health care industry. She was monogamous and reported no history of sexually transmitted illnesses. Vacci- nations were up to date, and she had no known medication allergies. She had visited Canada and Mexico the year before presentation but reported no other travel in the preceding 3 years. She had a healthy dog. She had seen evidence of rodents around the mountain cabin where she stayed while traveling in Europe but otherwise had no known animal exposures or tick bites. She drank alcohol in moderation and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother and father were healthy, and no other family members were ill.\nOn examination, the patient was alert, was able to answer questions, and appeared comfortable. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/78 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breath- ing ambient air. There was full range of motion in the neck, although flexion elicited mild pain in the posterior cervical region. No oropharyngeal ulcers or rashes were noted. The remainder of the examination was normal. Levels of electro- lytes and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of calcium, phos- phorus, magnesium, and thyrotropin. Blood tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cy- toplasmic antibodies were negative. Complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. A test for heterophile antibodies was negative, as was a screening assay for human immunodefi- ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen; HIV-1 RNA was not detected in the blood. Urinalysis revealed 1+ leukocyte esterase, 2+ blood, 1+ ketones, a pH of 7.0, and a specific gravity of 1.019; there were no red cells or white cells. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. McKinley Glover: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, infarction, or mass lesion; arterial and venous vasculature appeared normal, with no stenosis. Multiple cervical lymph nodes were mildly enlarged but otherwise unremarkable in appearance, findings that were suggestive of reactive nodes (Fig. 1).\nGadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI) of the head revealed no abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal, or pachymenin- geal enhancement or infarction. Radiography of the chest was normal.\nDr. Altman: A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal f luid (CSF) was cloudy and colorless; Gram\u2019s staining revealed abundant mononuclear cells and no organisms. There were 1422 total nucleated cells per microliter, of which 85% were lymphocytes. Nucleic acid test- ing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA was negative; additional results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were ob- tained. Intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acy- clovir, and ampicillin were administered, as were intravenous fluid, magnesium, diphenhydramine, magnesium, and metoclopramide.\nThe patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional test results were received. Nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as were tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for human meta- pneumovirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus antigens. Blood tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and syphilis were nonreactive,  and tests for 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and serum cryptococcal antigen were negative. Severe headache contin- ued, and intravenous ketorolac and hydromor- phone were administered for pain. A diagnostic test result was received.\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Geren S. Stone: This 26-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of migraines pre- sented with an 8-day history of severe headache that developed during a winter vacation in Europe. On presentation to this hospital, she described acute onset of \u201cthe worst headache of my life.\u201d Moreover, her headaches had been progressive, ongoing, and unresponsive to medications that had typically been effective in the treatment of her migraines. She also reported systemic symp- toms, including fever, chills, night sweats, and neck stiffness. Her CSF studies were consistent with meningitis, yet she appeared clinically well. Given that headache and meningitis were the most prominent features of her presentation, I will construct my initial differential diagnosis around this symptom complex.\n\nHeadache and Meningitis\nHeadaches are common, and clinicians must therefore be attentive for \u201cred f lag\u201d signs and symptoms that warrant a more in-depth evalua- tion.1 This patient\u2019s progression and severity of the headache, lack of response to treatment, and systemic symptoms were red flags that led her clinicians to perform a lumbar puncture that revealed abnormal CSF findings that were con- sistent with meningitis. The initial, most impor- tant action was to assess whether treatable causes of acute meningitis such as bacterial or HSV infection were present, since treatment de- lays for such infections may lead to clinically worse outcomes. It is appropriate to consider initiation of empirical treatment with antimicro- bial agents until data are available to help rule out these diagnoses.2-4\n\nBacterial Meningitis\nApproximately 95% of patients with bacterial meningitis present with at least two of the fol- lowing four symptoms: headache, fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status.5 This pa- tient had three of the four symptoms. However,unlike this patient, persons with bacterial men- ingitis are usually quite ill-appearing and pres- ent soon after the onset of symptoms. In addi- tion, although a predominance of lymphocytic cells in the CSF can occur early during the clinical course of acute bacterial meningitis, neutrophilic pleocytosis is more common. This patient\u2019s clinical presentation, negative Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF, and a lack of neutrophils in the CSF make the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis unlikely.\n\nHSV Encephalitis\nAlthough HSV infection can cause both menin- gitis and encephalitis, HSV encephalitis can be fatal and can be manifested by features that are clinically similar to those of acute bacterial meningitis, such as rapid onset and marked se- verity of headache, fever, and focal neurologic signs. HSV encephalitis is usually associated with frontotemporal signs, including behavior changes, amnesia, aphasia, seizures, and hemi- paresis.6 In patients with HSV encephalitis, MRI characteristically shows signal hyperintensity in the orbitofrontal and temporal lobes.7 These clinical and imaging findings were not present in this patient. In addition, a highly sensitive and specific HSV nucleic acid test was negative, making the diagnosis of HSV infection unlikely.\n\nOther Causes of Meningitis\nAfter evaluating whether common treatable causes of acute meningitis are present, the work- up for meningitis can focus on differentiating among the remaining other possible causes. The time course, illness trajectory, and the clinical syndrome \u2014 including findings on physical ex- amination, laboratory testing, and imaging \u2014 can help direct the workup. It is also important to consider patient-specific characteristics, in- cluding age, immune status, and exposure his- tory. Specifically, exposure history should in- clude the time of the year, travel history, sick contacts, insect bites, animal contact, medica- tions, and substance use.\nViral infections are the most common cause of acute meningitis, and enteroviruses are the most commonly identified viral pathogens.8-10 Enteroviruses have a seasonal distribution, with the highest incidence in summer and autumn, and they are transmitted from person to person by the fecal\u2013oral route. This patient presented in the winter and had no known sick contacts. In addition, although viral meningitis caused by enteroviruses is typically associated with lympho- cytic pleocytosis in the CSF, this patient\u2019s high number of lymphocytes, along with a high pro- tein level and a low glucose level, would be atypical for an enteroviral infection.\nVaricella\u2013zoster virus (VZV) meningitis can occur as a complication of a primary infection. However, it is more commonly associated with reactivation of VZV, even in the absence of cuta- neous lesions.8,11 This patient had chickenpox as a child, which places her at risk for reactivation. However, her CSF abnormalities would be atypi- cal for VZV.\nPrimary HIV infection is an important and underrecognized cause of meningitis.12 More- over, HIV testing is important in the evaluation of a patient with meningitis, since immunosup- pression makes a patient more susceptible to certain common infections (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae), as well as to opportunistic infec- tions. However, in this case, the patient had a negative screening test for HIV antibody and antigen and an undetectable blood HIV RNA viral load, findings that rule out a diagnosis of acute or chronic HIV infection.\nOther viral causes of meningitis that should be considered in this case include arboviruses such as West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Toscana virus, and tickborne encephalitis virus. Because this patient lives in the northeast- ern United States and has traveled to Europe, she is at risk for infections resulting from these viruses.13-15 However, the incidence of these infections is highest in late summer and early autumn, consistent with peak seasons for the mosquito, sand fly, and tick vectors. Therefore, given the patient\u2019s presentation during the win- ter and her low risk of exposure at this time, these diagnoses are unlikely in this case. Further- more, the patient\u2019s markedly elevated CSF lym- phocyte count, high protein level, and low glucose level would be atypical for these viral infections. Tuberculous meningitis is more common among patients who are immunocompromised than among those who are immunocompetent and generally leads to a chronic, progressive form of meningitis. Moreover, patients with tu- berculous meningitis characteristically present with neurologic features, including confusion, lethargy, and cranial-nerve deficits16 \u2014 findings\nthat were absent in this patient.\nAlthough spirochetes such as Treponema palli- dum and B. burgdorferi can also cause meningitis, this patient had no history of rash or other clinical finding consistent with these infections. Lyme disease usually occurs during warm months when ticks are active, and the patient did not report any known tick exposures. In addition, in this case, tests for syphilis and Lyme disease were both reportedly negative.\nThe patient did report exposure to rodents, which are an important reservoir for the spiro- chete leptospira. Although leptospirosis has been noted in parts of Europe, it is more common in tropical climates and is often associated with exposure to fresh water. In addition, this patient did not have other systemic features of leptospirosis, such as conjunctival suffusion, rigors, myalgias, jaundice, or renal failure, making this diagnosis unlikely.\nFungal infections are more common among patients who are immunocompromised than among those who are immunocompetent and, depending on the pathogen, may lead to a more chronic manifestation than that seen in this case. Coccidioides immitis can cause a lethal men- ingitis that develops within weeks to months after an often-unrecognized primary infection. Coccidioides is endemic in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northwest- ern Mexico. The patient\u2019s travel to Mexico in the year before presentation potentially places her at risk for infection. Coccidioidal meningitis may manifest with eosinophilic pleocytosis in the CSF, although it is typically associated with the presence of lymphocytes. More details about her trip would help in the evaluation of her risk. The patient\u2019s travel to Canada may place her at risk for infection with Cryptococcus gattii, a fungal patho- gen that has been identified as the causative agent of central nervous system infections in immunocompetent patients.17 However, in this case, cryptococcal antigen testing was negative, as were other laboratory tests for fungal infec- tions. Therefore, on the basis of her clinical presentation, exposure history, and laboratory test results, fungal meningitis seems unlikely.\nFinally, with respect to noninfectious causes\nof meningitis, the patient did not have a history of cancer or other inflammatory disease. Although nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were pre- scribed during this illness, the patient\u2019s previous exposure to medications appears to have been minimal. Her clinical examination and imaging were unremarkable except for reactive cervical lymphadenopathy. The values for her inflamma- tory and autoimmune markers, including anti- bodies, complement, C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were normal. Therefore, I do not think she has neoplastic, autoimmune, inflammatory, or drug-induced meningitis.\n\nMumps and Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection\nAlthough the results of the patient\u2019s CSF analy- sis were atypical for most viral causes of menin- gitis, there are two viruses that are associated with profound lymphocytic pleocytosis: mumps virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Historically, mumps virus has been a major cause of meningitis. This patient was probably vaccinated against mumps; however, immunity may wane. Mumps infections typically occur during late winter and early spring.Because mumps is transmitted by respiratory droplets and direct contact, it is highly infectious. The incubation period is approximately 15 to 24 days.18 Thus, this patient probably would have been infected before her travel. Meningitis occurs in up to 10% of patients with mumps infection19; it can precede, follow, or be concur- rent with parotid swelling, although parotitis may be absent in approximately 50% of cases.18 Patients with mumps meningitis may present with clinically significant lymphocytic pleocyto- sis in the CSF and a moderately low CSF glucose level.20,21 The diagnosis can be made by means of CSF nucleic acid testing, which should be per- formed in this case, although I do not think mumps is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s illness, given that she does not appear to have any risk factors for exposure to mumps virus.\nLCMV, the other virus associated with marked CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, is a rodent-borne arenavirus.14,20 Historically, LCMV was the first virus to be isolated directly from the CSF of hu- mans with meningitis.22,23 House mice are the natural reservoir, and an estimated 5% of house mice in the United States are infected.24 The virus can be transmitted to humans by direct contact or by aerosolization of rodent urine or feces. Infection is most common in the winter, when mice are indoors. LCMV infections have been reported in Europe. The infection has an incuba- tion period of approximately 1 to 2 weeks, and most infections are mild and self-limiting.14,25 Among patients in whom meningitis develops, the typical manifestation of infection is similar to that seen in this patient, with a biphasic ill- ness characterized by an influenza-like syndrome followed by a convalescent period of several days before the onset of meningismus.24  The diagnosis can be established by the detection of LCMV nucleic acids in the CSF during the acute stage of illness or by the detection of seroconversion to the virus on the basis of antibody testing dur- ing the acute and convalescent stages. Given the patient\u2019s clinical presentation, history of exposure to rodents, and CSF profile (marked lympho- cytic pleocytosis with a moderately low glucose level and a high protein level), LCMV infection is the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n\n\n",

Serologic and CSF testing were negative for common arboviruses, including West Nile virus, Powassan virus, tickborne encephalitis virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus. Serum and CSF samples were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for measurement of LCMV- specific immunoglobulins by means of an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The assay was positive for IgM and IgG antibodies (serum, IgM \u22651:6400 and IgG \u22651:1600; CSF, IgM and IgG \u22651:1280), consistent with recent LCMV in- fection.26,27 The ELISA for LCMV is available only at the CDC.26 Serologic testing by means of an immunofluorescence assay that is typi- cally performed at commercial laboratories has a lower sensitivity than ELISA for the detection of LCMV.26-28\nViral nucleic acids were not detected in this\npatient\u2019s CSF. However, the lumbar puncture was performed 3 weeks after the onset of phase 1 symptoms (i.e., influenza-like illness). LCMV nucleic acid testing may detect viral ribosomal nucleic acids in the blood or CSF only during the first 2 weeks after phase 1 symptoms begin.26-28 Six weeks after the lumbar puncture was per- formed, convalescent LCMV IgM and IgG in the patient\u2019s serum were both at or above 1:6400. These results reflect an increase in IgG and con-\nfirm the diagnosis of recent LCMV infection.\n",
