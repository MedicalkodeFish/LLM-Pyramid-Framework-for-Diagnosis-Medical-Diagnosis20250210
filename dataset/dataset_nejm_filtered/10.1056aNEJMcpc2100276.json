    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Carolina Chiou (Ophthalmology): A 78-year-old man was admitted to this hospi- tal because of a rash on the forehead and frontal scalp and edema of the left eyelids.\nThe patient had been well until 3 days before presentation, when pressurelike pain developed in the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp and the bilateral maxillary sinuses and upper jaws. He described the pain as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis. He was evaluated in the primary care clinic of another hos- pital, and treatment with oral clindamycin was started for a presumed diagnosis of sinusitis.\nTwo days before presentation, the patient noted erythema and small reddish- brown skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp. His barber had pointed out a similar spot on the top of his scalp 2 weeks earlier. The skin lesions were not painful or itchy, and he did not seek medical evaluation.\nOn the day of presentation, the patient awoke from sleep and noted redness and swelling of the left eyelids. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead and frontal scalp had increased in number, and some were covered with hemorrhagic crust. There was pain with movement of the left eye and blurry vision. Over the course of several hours, the swelling of the left eyelids worsened and the patient was unable to fully open the left eye. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported no ocular or nasal dis- charge, no changes in taste or hearing, and no jaw claudication. He had not re- cently changed his shampoo or been in a pool or hot tub. He had a history of recurrent sinus infection, allergic rhinitis, depression, benign prostatic hyperpla- sia, hypogonadism, and restless legs syndrome. He had received a diagnosis of rectal cancer 15 years earlier, which had led to partial colectomy, as well as a di- agnosis of testicular cancer 50 years earlier, which had led to orchiectomy and radiation therapy. His ocular history included bilateral mild ptosis; he had undergone bilateral cataract extraction with intraocular lens implan- tation. Medications included finasteride, tamsu- losin, carbidopa\u2013levodopa, nasal azelastine and fluticasone, and topical testosterone. Levofloxacin, cefaclor, and sulfamethoxazole\u2013trimethoprim had caused a rash. The patient was a retired engineer and lived with his wife in a coastal community of New England. He had previously smoked a pipe but had quit 30 years earlier. He drank a quarter glass of wine daily. His family history included skin cancer in his maternal grand- mother and macular degeneration in his sister.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/58 mm Hg, and the heart rate 74 beats per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 31.9. Visual acuity without  glasses  was  20/40  in  the  right  eye  and 20/50  in  the  left  eye.  Results  of  Ishihara  color testing were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; there was no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were full. There was complete ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with erythema and edema of left upper and lower lids. There was mild ptosis of the right upper lid. There was no proptosis. The intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse con- junctival injection and inferior chemosis in the left eye. The corneas were clear, and no cells were visualized in the anterior chambers. Results of dilated fundoscopic examination were normal. There was prominent erythema affecting the forehead, left side of the anterior scalp, and left eyelids. Multiple coalescing erosions covered with hemorrhagic and serous crust were seen at sites of erythema, mainly affecting the left side of the forehead and extending to the midline, the fron- tal scalp, and the left upper eyelid. Erosions and erythema affected the right side of the forehead, as well, but to a much lesser extent. The remain- der of the physical examination was normal.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed a blood sodi-\num level of 125 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145). Results of kidney- and liver-function tests were normal. Tests for human immunode- ficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Hillary R. Kelly: Computed tomography (CT) of the head and face (Fig. 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed marked swelling affecting the soft tis- sue over the left orbit and frontal sinus and ex- tending superiorly along the superficial soft tis- sue of the frontal scalp, predominantly on the left side. The globe, orbit, and retrobulbar soft tissue were normal. The right maxillary sinus showed nearly complete opacification with wall thickening and sclerosis, findings consistent with chronic inflammation and sinusitis. There was a defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus that was consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses, were well aerated.\nDr. Chiou: Empirical treatment with valacyclovir, amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, and topical bacitra- cin\u2013polymyxin B was started. The next day, the edema and erythema of the left eyelids worsened, and there was new edema and erythema of the right eyelids. The patient was unable to open his eyes. He began to have visual hallucinations, and his wife noted that he was confused. The skin lesions on the left side of the forehead were unchanged, and new round punched-out erosions with overlying hemorrhagic crust were present on the right side of the forehead (Fig. 2). Em- pirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir was started.\n\nFigure 1. CT of the Head and Face.\nAxial images obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material and reconstructed in soft\u2011tissue algo\u2011 rithm (Panels A and B) show marked edema of the left eyelids and preseptal soft tissues superficial to the left orbit (Panel A, arrows) and fluid and edema within the frontal scalp (Panel B, arrow). No postseptal inflammatory changes are present; the normal and symmetric appearance of the orbital fat is consistent with findings on a representative coronal image reconstructed in soft\u2011tissue algorithm (Panel C). A coronal image reconstructed in bone algorithm (Panel D) at the same anatomical level as the representative image shows nearly complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus with thickening and sclerosis of the walls of the right maxillary sinus (arrow), findings consistent with chronic sinusitis. A defect in the medial wall of the right maxillary sinus (arrowhead) is consistent with previous sinus surgery. The other paranasal sinuses, including the left maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinuses, and sphenoid sinuses bordering the left orbit, are well aerated.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael K. Yoon: This 78-year-old man pre- sented with evolving lesions affecting the fore- head and scalp, along with eyelid edema and blurry vision. The differential diagnosis for pro- gressive skin lesions is broad, but the location around the eye narrows the range of possibilities in this case. The clinical appearance of the le- sions, rapid progression, and fever move the possibility of infection to the top of the list. This patient also had skin changes involving the eye- lids and periocular region.\nAn important early distinction is whether the process affects superficial preseptal structures (anterior to the orbital septum) or deeper orbital structures (posterior to the orbital septum). The orbital septum is a tough multilamellar mem- brane that connects to the periosteum of the face and orbit and extends from the orbital rims through the eyelids. This membrane serves ana- tomically as a boundary that separates the eyelid from the orbit and clinically as a barrier to the spread of infection and tumor. Although orbital processes can subsequently involve preseptal tis- sues and preseptal processes can involve orbital tissues, the orbital septum often prevents such spread of disease. Conditions that affect the orbit are usually more severe and challenging to treat than those that are limited to the preseptal space.\nOrbital Infections\nInfection of the orbit can have serious complica- tions that pose a risk of vision loss and even death, given the proximity to the eye, optic nerve, and intracranial space. Orbital infection can manifest as diffuse cellulitis or focal abscess. Most cases of orbital cellulitis arise from a bacterial infection of the sinus; less common sources include infection of the overlying skin or hema- togenous spread of infection from a distant site. Although signs of orbital cellulitis are most commonly due to infection, inflammatory pro- cesses can mimic orbital cellulitis in rare cases.1 Physical examination can help in distinguish- ing between orbital and preseptal conditions. Typical findings of an orbital process include proptosis and abnormalities of structures within the orbit, most notably the optic nerve and extra- ocular muscles. If ptosis is present, as it was in this patient, the eyelids need to be manually lifted by the examiner so that the eyes can be fully visualized. This patient did not have pro- ptosis or an afferent pupillary defect, and eye motility was normal. The absence of these orbital signs argues against an orbital process such as cellulitis or abscess. In addition, although the CT scan showed opacification of the right max- illary sinus, a finding consistent with chronic sinusitis, the left orbit was normal, providing further evidence that orbital cellulitis can be\nruled out in this case.\n\nPreseptal Infections\nTypical findings of a preseptal process include cutaneous erythema, edema, and warmth, with a variable level of pain. However, the eye itself is almost always normal, with a white sclera and no conjunctival injection. Although this patient had conjunctival injection, the overall findings on physical examination are most consistent with a preseptal condition.\nNecrotizing fasciitis is the most serious infection to occur in the periocular region, but it occurs in this location rarely. It is commonly due to group A streptococcus and is associated with rapidly progressive erythema, the formation of bullae, the presence of crepitus on palpation, and an ill appearance in most patients. Although this patient had rapid progression of erythema and edema, the appearance of his skin lesions, the normal leukocyte count, and his otherwise healthy appearance make the possibility of necro- tizing fasciitis unlikely.\nCellulitis that arises from trauma followed by a bacterial superinfection could cause progres- sive painful erythema and edema. This patient did not report any trauma to the scalp, and the appearance of his skin lesions is not consistent with cellulitis.\nA hordeolum, colloquially referred to as a stye, is an acute infection of specialized glands in the eyelid. Although most patients with a hordeolum present with focal erythema and swelling of the eyelid, severe eyelid swelling can develop. Unlike this patient\u2019s lesions, which started on the fore- head, a hordeolum begins on the eyelid and the swelling spreads circumferentially away from the source.\nEyelid abscesses are uncommon in the absence of trauma. Eyebrow abscesses are due to focal infection of hair follicles, which occurs more often in women than in men and is associated with eyebrow grooming or acne. Cutaneous ab- scesses often form a single pustular whitehead with surrounding edema and erythema. The pres- ence of multiple skin lesions with hemorrhagic crust is not consistent with an abscess.\nViral conjunctivitis is a common and highly contagious infection caused primarily by adeno- viruses. Symptoms include itching, irritation, and the sensation of a foreign body in the eye; con- junctival hyperemia, discharge, and eyelid swell- ing are almost always present. Although this patient had conjunctival redness and eyelid swell- ing, the cutaneous findings are not consistent with viral conjunctivitis.\nAllergic reactions of all types can result in erythema, edema, and cutaneous changes in the eyelids and periocular region. This patient\u2019s rash is not consistent with a contact hypersensitivity reaction or urticaria.\nFinally, insect bites or stings can cause ery- thema, edema, induration, and pruritus of the eyelid. This patient did not report any mosquito\n \n\nbites or bee stings, which are typically witnessed. Spider bites can cause severe necrotizing inflam- mation and toxic effects in the periocular region, leading to the use of systemic antibiotic agents or surgical intervention; however, unwitnessed bites are very rare and unlikely to have occurred in this patient.\nBecause preseptal cellulitis and conditions that mimic such an infection are unlikely in this patient, I will consider whether he could have an atypical presentation of a \u201ccannot miss\u201d diagno- sis, such as giant-cell arteritis or herpes zoster ophthalmicus.\n\nGiant-Cell Arteritis\nCould this patient have giant-cell arteritis? If untreated, this condition can cause irreversible blindness, stroke, and in very rare cases, death. Because the prevalence increases with advancing age, giant-cell arteritis is an important consider- ation in this 78-year-old man.\nIn patients with giant-cell arteritis, a process (similar to the process that leads to blindness) can occur in which occlusion of the superficial temporal artery, which supplies blood to the frontal and parietal scalp, causes ischemia and necrosis of the skin. The necrotic scalp lesions can vary in size and appearance; they typically include large areas of dusky or escharlike lesions with crust or oozing.2 The lesions can extend deep into the scalp, sometimes down to the calvarium, and can be unilateral or bilateral. Although this patient\u2019s skin lesions could be consistent with the cutaneous findings described in patients with giant-cell arteritis, the incidence of scalp necrosis associated with this disease is quite low, with less than 85 reported cases in the literature.2\nThis patient had superficial coalescing discrete\nscalp lesions, not the large escharlike lesions typically seen in patients with giant-cell arteritis. In addition, he reported pressurelike pain simi- lar to sinusitis, not the extreme scalp tenderness and jaw claudication commonly associated with giant-cell arteritis. The normal erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate and absence of thrombocytosis also argue against this diagnosis. A biopsy of the superficial temporal artery, which is the stan- dard method for diagnosis, would not be neces- sary in this case, because giant-cell arteritis is unlikely to explain this patient\u2019s symptoms.\nHerpes Zoster Ophthalmicus\nA diagnosis that is more common than giant- cell arteritis and also more likely to cause skin lesions around the eye is herpes zoster ophthal- micus, which is due to reactivation of varicella\u2013 zoster virus (VZV) infection. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and other types of herpes zoster usually affect a single dermatome, because the virus lies dormant within a cranial nerve, dorsal root, or autonomic ganglion before reactivation. Up to 30% of people in the United States have reactivation of VZV infection in their lifetime,3 and 10 to 20% of cases involve the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve; the lifetime risk of developing herpes zoster ophthalmicus is 1%,4 and the incidence increases with age.\nThe rash that develops in patients with her-\npes zoster ophthalmicus, which is the same as that seen with herpes zoster involving other re- gions of the body, is characterized by erythema, macules, papules, and vesicles. The vesicles can erupt progressively, over a period of several days, and then evolve into pustules and crust, often with surrounding erythema and edema. These features were seen in this patient.\nAt the onset of the rash, most patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus have acute pain caused by the associated inflammation and dam- age to the sensory nerve and affected skin. The pain has been described as itching, burning, aching, and piercing. This patient reported pain in the scalp and forehead 2 days before the onset of skin lesions, although he described it as similar to previous episodes of sinusitis and was treated for presumed sinusitis.\nUp to two thirds of patients with herpes zos- ter ophthalmicus have ocular manifestations in addition to the cutaneous lesions.5 These can affect the cornea, conjunctiva, iris, retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the ocular system. This patient had conjunctival injection and chemosis, findings that commonly occur with herpes zos- ter ophthalmicus.\nIn this patient, the combination of skin le- sions with crust, pain, and conjunctival edema and injection is suggestive of herpes zoster ophthalmicus. However, the involvement of more than one dermatome is atypical of this diagno- sis; herpes zoster classically affects a single der- matome and usually does not cross the midline. In some cases, localized zoster can involve one or two adjacent dermatomes.6 Progression of the disease to affect the contralateral side, referred to as herpes zoster multiplex bilateralis, is atypi- cal in immunocompetent hosts such as this patient, but it can occur.\nProgressive cutaneous lesions developed in this patient while he was receiving acyclovir, which is the standard treatment for herpes zoster ophthalmicus. However, cutaneous lesions can continue to form for 3 to 7 days after the initia- tion of antiviral therapy.\nCould the development of hallucinations indi- cate involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by VZV? Although this is possible, it should be noted that ptosis due to eyelid edema ob- structed the patient\u2019s vision, rendering him func- tionally blind. Another important consideration for the cause of this patient\u2019s hallucinations is Charles Bonnet syndrome, a condition character- ized by the development of visual hallucinations in visually impaired persons.7\nThe most likely diagnosis in this patient is herpes zoster ophthalmicus. This diagnosis can be established clinically without any testing. If there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis, nu- merous tests are available; it would have been reasonable to perform testing in this patient. A virus-specific direct f luorescent antibody test used to quickly analyze scrapings obtained from the base of a cutaneous lesion was probably the diagnostic test performed in this case.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Diane G. Brackett: A punch biopsy sample of skin from the left side of the forehead was ob- tained (Fig. 3). On histologic examination at low magnification, the epidermis was denuded and the dermis was involved by an inflammatory pro- cess. Patches of acantholytic keratinocytes were seen clinging to the surface. The underlying der- mis was involved by marked acute inflamma- tion, which extended deeply to involve hair fol- licles and adjacent adnexal structures, including sebaceous glands. At higher magnification, the acantholytic keratinocytes showed viral cytopath- ic changes, including multinucleation with mold- ing and chromatin margination. These viral cyto- pathic changes can be seen with both VZV infection and HSV infection, making these enti- ties indistinguishable on the basis of histologic examination alone; clinicopathological correla- tion and ancillary testing are required to deter- mine the cause. The diagnosis was confirmed with an immunohistochemical stain for VZV, which showed strong, diffuse staining of the infected keratinocytes.\n\nFigure 3. Biopsy Sample of Skin from the Left Side of the Forehead.\nOn hematoxylin and eosin staining at low magnification (Panel A), the epi\u2011 dermis is denuded (black arrow) and the underlying dermis and adnexal structures are involved by an inflammatory process. Acantholytic keratino\u2011 cytes are present on the surface (blue arrow) and extend downward into a hair follicle (green arrow), and extensive inflammation surrounds the hair follicle and adjacent sebaceous glands (yellow arrow). At high magnifica\u2011 tion (Panel B), numerous acantholytic keratinocytes show viral cytopathic changes (arrows). Immunohistochemical staining for varicella\u2013zoster virus (Panel C) shows strong, diffuse staining of the infected keratinocytes (in brown).\n",
