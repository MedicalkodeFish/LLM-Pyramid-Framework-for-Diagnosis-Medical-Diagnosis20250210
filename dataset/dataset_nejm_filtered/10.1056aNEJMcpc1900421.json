    "Primary Symptom": "A 44-Year-Old Man with Neck Pain and Swelling",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 44-year-old right-handed man was admitted to the cardiol- ogy unit of this hospital because of pain and swelling on the left side of the neck. Twelve weeks earlier, at this hospital, the patient had undergone uncomplicated placement of an implantable cardioverter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) through the left ce- phalic vein (Fig. 1). Immediately after implantation, he began to have a transient sensation of \u201cpins and needles\u201d in the left hand; he previously had had similar, work-related tingling and decreased sensation in the ulnar-nerve distribution of the left arm. Neurologic examination was normal. A chest radiograph showed that the ICD leads were in the appropriate positions (Fig. 2A). Three weeks after im-\nplantation, routine interrogation of the ICD was normal.\nFive weeks after implantation, the patient awoke with a headache and neck pain on the left side. He initially attributed the pain to his sleeping position, but it continued throughout the day. When numbness and tingling developed in the left fingertips, along with shooting pains in the left arm and toes, he presented to another hospital and was admitted for further evaluation.\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: At the other hospital, imaging studies were obtained. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head, obtained without the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, was normal. CT angiography of the chest and abdomen ruled out pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection but revealed a partially visible mass in the left supraclavicular region (Fig. 2B). Ultrasonography of the neck revealed a complex mass, measuring 4.3 cm in diameter, without in- ternal Doppler flow (Fig. 2C). These findings were thought to be most consistent with a hematoma.\nDr. Dudzinski: Numbness and tingling in the left arm increased in intensity, and the next morning, the patient was transferred to the cardiology unit of this hospi- tal, where he was evaluated by the neurology and vascular surgery services. Exami- nation was notable for tenderness and firmness in the left supraclavicular fossa, without erythema or drainage, and mildly diminished pinprick sensation along the lateral dorsum of the left hand and the ophthal- mic and maxillary branches of the left trigemi- nal nerve.\nDr. Mendoza: Repeat ultrasonography of the neck and supraclavicular fossa on the left side revealed a heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion, measuring 4.5 cm in diameter, that was sugges- tive of an evolving hematoma.\nDr. Dudzinski: Ultrasonographically guided needle aspiration revealed 5 ml of thin, brown f luid that was suggestive of old blood, with 104,500 white cells per cubic millimeter, of which 79% were neutrophils. Gram\u2019s staining revealed few neutrophils and mononuclear cells and no organisms. An acid-fast stain for mycobacteria was negative, and microbiologic cultures were performed. Clopidogrel was stopped, and the dose of aspirin was increased. The patient was discharged after 2 days. He received a 7-day course of cephalexin, a tapering course of ga- bapentin, and oxycodone to be taken as needed. He was advised to avoid lifting his arm above his head.\nTwo weeks after discharge, at the electrophys-\niology clinic of this hospital, the patient reported that the neck swelling had greatly reduced but residual numbness was present in the tips of the left third, fourth, and fifth digits. Five days after the evaluation in the electrophysiology clinic, he returned to the emergency department of this hospital for recurrent swelling and pain in the neck and supraclavicular region on the left side; numbness and tingling in the face, shoulder, and arm on the left side; mild dysphagia; and a feel- ing that his face was hotter on the left side than on the right side. Residual numbness in the tips of the left third, fourth, and fifth digits persisted. Examination was notable for reduced sensation in the left trigeminal-nerve distribution and dys- esthesia in the trigeminal-nerve distribution and left arm.\nThe patient was admitted to the cardiology\nunit. The hemoglobin level was 11.4 g per deci- liter (normal range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the hema- tocrit 32.3% (normal range, 41 to 53). All other blood test results, including the troponin T level and results of liver-function tests, were normal, as was urinalysis. Specimens of blood were ob- tained for culture, and additional imaging stud- ies were performed.\nDr. Mendoza: Ultrasonography again revealed a heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion, measuring 3.9\tcm in diameter, in the left supraclavicular re- gion; the left internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic veins were patent. Contrast- enhanced CT of the neck revealed a heteroge- neous mass, measuring 4.0 cm in diameter, that was located in the soft tissue of the left side of the neck, deep to the sternocleidomastoid mus- cle and abutting the left common carotid artery and brachial plexus (Fig. 2D). Small calcifica- tions were noted in the mass. There was no evi- dence of arterial or venous obstruction.\nDr. Dudzinski: Needle aspiration of the mass was again performed and revealed 1.5 ml of thick red f luid that appeared to be consistent with blood. Gram\u2019s staining revealed abundant mono- nuclear cells and no neutrophils or organisms. Fluid aspirate was obtained for culture. Cepha- lexin and gabapentin were resumed, and the pa- tient was discharged after 2 days.\nTwo weeks after discharge, in the electro- physiology clinic, the patient reported resolution of the pain in the neck and arm on the left side. He had numbness in only the left third, fourth, and fifth digits. Clopidogrel was resumed.\nTwo weeks later, neck swelling recurred. The patient had local, dull pain in the supraclavicular fossa that radiated toward the left ear and left trapezius muscle. He also began to have focal swelling on the left side of the face and throat fullness, without dyspnea, drooling, or dysphonia, and he sought evaluation at the emergency de- partment of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for sciatica and heartburn. The patient had no symptoms of heart failure or dysrhythmia, fever, chills, sweats, chest pain, weight loss, appetite change, rash, or pruritus. The medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary ar- tery disease with two anterior ST-segment eleva- tion myocardial infarctions. The first, which had occurred 8 years before this admission, was treated with percutaneous coronary interventions and was complicated by acute in-stent thrombo- sis and later in-stent restenosis. The second, which had occurred 14 months before this ad- mission in the presence of occlusion of the pre- viously placed stents, was treated with intra- aortic balloon counterpulsation and multivessel coronary-artery bypass grafting. The patient had resultant ischemic cardiomyopathy and progres- sive left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with a current left ventricular ejection fraction of 28%. In addition, the patient had a history of asthma, for which he had had multiple intuba- tions, tapering courses of glucocorticoids, and admissions to the intensive care unit. When he was 20 years of age, he had testicular cancer, for which he received treatment with orchiectomy and chemotherapy at another hospital. He also had a history of erosive esophagitis and depres- sion. Medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, simvastatin, carvedilol, lisinopril, gabapentin, quetiapine, and omeprazole. Heparin had caused thrombocytopenia, and various statin drugs had caused myalgias.\nThere was no family history of coronary ar- tery disease or cardiomyopathy. The patient\u2019s mother had hypertension and diabetes, and his father, brother, and two children were all healthy. He was disabled and had not worked since he had his first myocardial infarction. He smoked a half pack of cigarettes per day and had done so since he was 16 years of age, and he also smoked marijuana. He had a history of binge drinking, which had been complicated by pan- creatitis, as well as a history of cocaine use, but he had been abstinent from both alcohol and cocaine for the previous 3 years.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/74 mm Hg in both arms, the respi- ratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxy- gen saturation 98% while the patient was breath- ing ambient air. The height was 170 cm, the weight 81.2 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 28.1. He was anxious and in mild discomfort. In the left supraclavicular fossa, there was a nontender, nonerythematous, nonmobile mass, measuring 6 cm by 4 cm, with- out overlying skin changes or a thrill or bruit. The deltopectoral incision was well healed. The jugular venous pulse on the right side was 5 cm of water with a normal contour, and both ca- rotid pulses were 2+ without bruits. There was a systolic  murmur  (grade  1/6)  at  the  left  upper sternal border. Radial and ulnar pulses, strength, fine-motor coordination, and sensation to light touch and pinprick were symmetric in the left and right arms. The remainder of the examina- tion was normal.\nThe hemoglobin level was 12.2 g per deciliter, the hematocrit 34.9%, and the plasma creatinine level 1.65 mg per deciliter (146 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]). An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and evi- dence of old anteroseptal and lateral myocardial infarctions, findings that were all unchanged from previous studies.\nDr. Mendoza: Ultrasonography of the left side of the neck revealed no substantial change in the complex mass in the left supraclavicular region. The carotid artery was patent, and there was no Doppler flow in the mass or evidence of pseudo- aneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.\nDr. Dudzinski: The patient was admitted to the cardiology unit. Aspirin and clopidogrel were withheld, and normal saline was administered intravenously. On the second hospital day, trans- brachial arteriography was performed to evalu- ate for a possible injury to subclavian vessels with delayed local bleeding. The subclavian arte- rial system was normal, without extravasation, but there was evidence of a blush in the area of the mass.\n\n\nFigure 2. Imaging Studies.\nA frontal radiograph of the chest (Panel A) shows appropriate positioning of the ICD in the left side of the chest, with leads in the right atrial appendage and right ventricle. A coronal CT image of the chest (Panel B), obtained to rule out an aortic dissection and pulmonary embolism, shows a partially visible mass in the left supraclavicular re\u2011 gion (arrows). A color Doppler ultrasound image of the left side of the neck (Panel C) shows a heterogeneous mass with anechoic areas (arrow) and isoechoic areas (arrowheads); the anechoic areas suggest a fluid component, whereas the isoechoic areas suggest a solid mass or clot. No internal vascular flow is visible. A coronal CT image of the neck (Panel D) shows a mass in the left supraclavicular region, with a small focus of calcification (arrow).\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Dudzinski: The suspected cause of the mass in the supraclavicular fossa had been a hematoma related to the ICD implantation, given the tem- poral proximity to the procedure. Complications of ICD implantation have been reviewed.1 The overall rate of complications after ICD implanta- tion \u2014 including bleeding complications such as local hematomas, vascular complications such as venous thromboses, and infections \u2014 is ap- proximately 3%.\nIn this patient, a hematoma was considered in part because he had been receiving anticoagu- lation with dual antiplatelet therapy.6 Aspirations of the mass revealed brown and red fluids that were interpreted as consistent with a hematoma. However, hematomas that develop after ICD im- plantation are typically located at the insertion site (deltopectoral groove) rather than the supra- clavicular fossa (Fig. 1),5 and they are typically an earlier complication after implantation rather than one that persists for 3 months. When I met this patient, he was presenting for the third time with the same concern, with an atypical location (Fig. 1), atypical time course, and atypical natu- ral history of a hematoma that occurs after ICD implantation. It was clear that the differential diagnosis needed to be broadened to counter possible heuristic errors, such as search satisfac- tion, framing, premature closure, anchoring, confirmation bias, and diagnostic momentum.7 We therefore considered potential causes of acquired neck masses that may have both a hetero- geneous echotexture and internal calcifications. The differential diagnosis included vascular causes (e.g., subclavian-vessel injury or arteriovenous fistula), infectious causes (e.g., abscess), diseases with lymph-node involvement (e.g., Castle- man\u2019s disease, sarcoidosis, or Kimura\u2019s disease), an autoimmune mass, a benign mass (e.g., com- plex cyst, osteochondroma, cylindroma, or pilo- matricoma), primary cancer (lymphoma, sar- coma, or paraganglioma), and metastatic cancer (originating in the aerodigestive tract, thyroid, or a previous cancer).8-10\nA biopsy of the mass was recommended to establish the diagnosis. Because vascular injury remained a consideration, transbrachial arteriog- raphy had also been performed. The subclavian artery was normal, without extravasation, but there was a vascular blush near the mass. An incision was made over the mass, with dissection of the platysma and the border of the sternoclei- domastoid clavicular head, whereupon some old blood, suggestive of previous hemorrhage, was aspirated and a biopsy specimen was obtained. \n",
