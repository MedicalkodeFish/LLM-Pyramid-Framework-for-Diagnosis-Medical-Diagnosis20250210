    "Primary Symptom": "A 25-Year-Old Woman with Abdominal Pain and Jerking Movements",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. John C. Schell (Medicine): A 25-year-old woman with a history of acute intermit- tent porphyria was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain and jerk-       ing movements of the right arm and leg.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 days before this admis- sion, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed. She also felt confused and agitated, and a rash developed on her chest. One day before this admission, four episodes of jerking movements of the right arm and leg occurred, and the patient was concerned that she was having seizures. She presented to another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient reported that the symptoms were consistent with her previous flares of acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that jerking movements of the right arm and leg had occurred 5 minutes before her arrival at the hospital and had caused jaw dislocation; she also reported that the rash on her chest had become painful. On examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable. The mental-status and neurologic examinations were reportedly normal. The jaw was dislocated to the left, and there was diffuse abdominal tenderness. Intrave- nous morphine, diphenhydramine, and ondansetron were administered; an infu- sion of dextrose was started; and the dislocated jaw was manually reduced. The patient was admitted to the other hospital. The next day, the severity of pain in  the abdomen and rash increased. Transfer to this hospital was requested because of a shortage of hemin at the other hospital.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient described intense pain in the abdo- men, a painful rash, and persistent nausea, agitation, and confusion. She was worried that she might have seizures, have blistering of the skin, or die because  the hemin infusion had been delayed. Additional history was obtained from the patient. She had a history of obesity, anxiety, and chronic pain that had been attributed to acute intermittent porphyria. She reported that acute intermittent porphyria had been diagnosed 13 years before this admission, when abdominal pain, jerking movements of the right arm and leg, and a painful rash developed during menarche. During the 13 years before this admission, one or two flares of acute intermittent porphyria had occurred each year; during the 6 months before this admission, no flares had occurred.\nTwo previous flares of acute intermittent por- phyria had been treated with a hemin infusion. During the first hemin infusion, the patient had a reaction that was characterized by intense yell- ing and writhing in pain, and intubation was performed to complete the infusion. Before the second hemin infusion, she received intravenous methylprednisolone and underwent elective intu- bation to prevent a reaction. The patient identi- fied heat, stress, and menses as triggers for acute intermittent porphyria flares.\nMedications included intravenous diphenhydra- mine and dextrose, which were administered daily through a central-venous-access port in the right side of the chest. The patient had previ- ously taken intravenous morphine daily; how- ever, she had not had access to this medication for approximately 3 months because of an in- ability to transport it from her home in the United Kingdom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and penicillin had caused anaphylaxis, prochlorperazine had caused flushing, metoclo- pramide had caused anxiety, and fentanyl had caused altered mental status.\nThe patient was born in New England and had moved to the United Kingdom 15 years ear- lier. She was a student in a graduate program at  a university in the United Kingdom and had re- turned to New England to visit her family. She did not use alcohol or illicit drugs, and she did not vape or smoke cigarettes. Her mother had dementia, and her father had died years earlier from an unknown cause. Her maternal grandmother  had  acute  intermittent  porphyria. Her immediate family had undergone genetic testing for acute intermittent porphyria; her brother was an asymptomatic carrier of a pathogenic variant, and her six other siblings were not carriers.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 144/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared older than her stated age. She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was frus- trated and irritable, with pressured speech. A port in the right side of the chest was palpated. Tenderness in the abdomen was diffuse but was worst in the right upper quadrant. Erythematous plaques and excoriations were present on the arms and chest and under the breasts. The neu- rologic examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver- function tests. The hemoglobin level was 10.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0) and the platelet count 120,000 per microliter (refer- ence range, 150,000 to 400,000). A urine speci- men was obtained for measurement of the uri- nary porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrin levels, but the amount of urine was inadequate. Oral acetaminophen and intravenous morphine, di- phenhydramine, lorazepam, and ondansetron were administered. Infusions of dextrose and hemin were started, and the patient was admit- ted to this hospital.\nDuring the subsequent 2 days, the hemin in- fusion was continued, but the patient\u2019s symp- toms did not abate. On the second hospital day, an additional urine specimen was obtained; the urinary PBG level was 0.3 \u03bcmol per liter (refer- ence range, 0.0 to 1.3) and the uroporphyrin level 4 nmol per liter (reference range, 0 to 30). On the third hospital day, the patient reported worsening jerking movements of the right arm and leg, which she believed had caused jaw dis- location. On examination, the jaw was dislocated to the left. She did not cooperate with a manual reduction, and a surgical reduction of the jaw was performed.\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Wilton A. van Klei: This 59-year-old woman with obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea presented for transsphenoidal hypophy- sectomy. A preoperative cardiac evaluation in- cluded echocardiography, which revealed a nor- mal ejection fraction, and a pharmacologic stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia. After the induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure gradually  decreased  from  131/69  mm  Hg  to 67/36  mm  Hg,  and  ECG  changes  suggestive  of cardiac ischemia developed. I will first consider possible causes of the intraoperative hypotension that occurred during the induction of anesthesia that preceded the first attempted procedure.\n\nIntraoperative Hypotension\nA decrease in blood pressure after the induction of anesthesia is common. The degree of decrease in blood pressure that is considered to be abnor- mal is not clear, since a single definition of intra- operative hypotension that applies to all patients does not exist. The most commonly used thresh- old is a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg, which is associated with adverse out- comes such as myocardial injury, kidney injury, and death. Nearly two thirds of patients under general anesthesia have at least one episode of intraoperative hypotension when the condition is defined by a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg.1-3 To determine the cause of intraoperative hypotension in this patient, the timing relative to the surgery (between induc- tion and surgery, during surgery, or immediately after surgery), patient risk factors, and proce- dural risk factors should all be considered.\n\nTiming of Intraoperative Hypotension Relative to Surgery\nThis patient began to have hypotension during the period between induction of anesthesia and surgery, when the mean arterial pressure de- creased to 46 mm Hg. Hypotension that occurs during this period is most commonly due to the sympatholytic effects of anesthetics, whereas hy- potension that develops during surgery can also be caused by blood loss or reduced venous return resulting from surgical compression.\n\nPatient-Related Risk Factors for Intraoperative Hypotension\nPatient-related risk factors for intraoperative hypotension include age-related physiologic changes, pathophysiological changes due to coexisting conditions, and medication use.3,4 The physiologic increase in arterial stiffness and decreases in intra- vascular volume, baroreceptor reflex, and myocar- dial contractility that occur with older age can result in clinically significant hypotension after the administration of anesthetics; however, such changes would be unlikely causes of hypotension in this 59-year-old patient. In addition, the pa- tient did not have coexisting conditions that are typically associated with intraoperative hypoten- sion, such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pe- ripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hypothyroid- ism, or adrenal insufficiency.\nCould the patient\u2019s medications have caused\nintraoperative hypotension? Intravascular volume depletion from the use of hydrochlorothiazide or residual blockade of angiotensin II\u2013mediated va- soconstriction might have contributed to a de- crease in blood pressure but would be unlikely to have caused the degree of hypotension that this patient had. She did not take other medica- tions known to contribute to the occurrence of hypotension after induction of anesthesia, such as antiarrhythmic medications, which reduce the heart rate and have a negative inotropic effect.\nThe fact that the patient had a gradual development of hypotension that abated after the admin- istration of ephedrine and phenylephrine argues against an anaphylactic reaction to other medi- cations such as rocuronium and piperacillin\u2013 tazobactam, which were administered during the period of induction of anesthesia.\n\nProcedural Risk Factors for Intraoperative Hypotension\nProcedural risk factors for intraoperative hypo- tension include the type and urgency of surgery, positioning of the patient, blood loss, and type of anesthesic agents administered. Transsphe- noidal hypophysectomy was a planned neurosur- gical procedure, and the hypotension occurred before the procedure began; therefore, blood loss was not a factor in this case. The patient was placed in the supine position rather than the prone position, the latter of which is more commonly associated with hypotension that is due to re- duced venous return.\nCould the patient\u2019s hypotension have resulted from the administration of the general anesthet- ics? The use of propofol decreases both systemic vascular resistance and myocardial contractility. The use of remifentanil decreases systemic vas- cular resistance and reduces the heart rate. Vola- tile anesthetics used for the maintenance of anes- thesia, such as sevoflurane, also cause a decrease in vascular resistance. Rocuronium \u2014 a neuro- muscular blocking agent \u2014 usually does not af- fect the cardiovascular system, except in the case of an anaphylactic reaction.\nThis patient\u2019s hypotension and ECG changes occurred after the administration of multiple medications to induce general anesthesia and at the start of the maintenance phase of general anesthesia with sevoflurane and infusion of remifentanil but before any painful stimuli were present. The hypotension developed gradually and abated after the administration of ephedrine and phenylephrine. The occurrence of hypoten- sion is not uncommon when the doses of anes- thesics are adjusted for an individual patient. If I had been caring for the patient during the first attempted procedure, I would have attributed the hypotension to a side effect of the anesthesics that was greater than expected. However, the ST-segment elevations require additional investi- gation.\nST-Segment Elevations\nShortly after the onset of hypotension, telemetric monitoring showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. These are uncommon intraoperative ECG chang- es, even though intraoperative hypotension is com- mon among patients under general anesthesia. ST-segment elevations are seen with coronary occlusion but can also occur in patients with takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy or coronary vasospasm. No characteristic findings of takot- subo cardiomyopathy were seen on intraoperative TEE, and there was no obvious trigger. I would be very concerned about inferior-wall myocardial ischemia as the cause of the ST-segment eleva- tions. However, additional cardiac investigation revealed only moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery, and intra- operative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm.\nSecond Attempted Procedure\nWhen the patient returned to the operating room for the rescheduled procedure 3 weeks later, she had sudden and severe hypotension, and the mean arterial pressure decreased to 37 mm Hg after anesthesia was induced. The abrupt nature of the hypotension that developed after induction of anesthesia before the second attempted procedure is highly suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction.\n\n \nAnaphylaxis\nThe occurrence of anaphylaxis in the operating room is rare. The incidence is estimated to be one case per 10,000 to 20,000 procedures, and neuro- muscular blocking agents such as rocuronium are reported to be the most common cause, account- ing for 50 to 70% of cases. The second most common cause is antibiotic agents.5 This patient was exposed to both a neuromuscular blocking agent and antibiotics before the rapid onset of severe hypotension, which makes anaphylaxis the most likely diagnosis in this case.\nCould anaphylaxis also explain the ST-seg- ment changes seen on intraoperative telemetric monitoring? Coronary vasospasm associated with mast-cell activation due to anaphylaxis has been reported and is a clinical entity called the Kou- nis syndrome.6 Anaphylaxis could explain both the patient\u2019s hypotension and her ST-segment elevations, and I suspect that the diagnostic test that was performed in this case was drug-allergy testing.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Paul E. Hesterberg: I was asked to evaluate this patient for anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a highly likely diagnosis if any of the following three criteria are met: sudden onset of illness with involvement of skin or mucosal tissue and either respiratory symptoms or cardiovascular symptoms; involvement of two or more systems (cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal) after exposure to a likely allergen or trigger; or reduced blood pressure alone after exposure to a known allergen for that patient.7 In patients with perioperative anaphylaxis, cardiovascular symp- toms are common and can be the sole feature of anaphylaxis,8 as was the case in this patient.\nThe diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be made on the basis of serial measurement of the total trypt- ase level in blood samples obtained immediately after or shortly after symptoms begin, followed by measurement of the baseline level (in a blood sample obtained >24 hours after symptom reso- lution). Blood tryptase levels rise rapidly during the first 90 minutes after anaphylaxis, with a plasma half-life of approximately 2 hours.9 Therefore, tryptase levels for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis should ideally be measured within 4 hours after the onset of symptoms.\nIn this patient, serial measurement of the tryptase level was performed in blood samples obtained beginning approximately 15 minutes after the onset of hypotension. The initial blood level of tryptase was 7.4 ng per milliliter (refer- ence value, <11.5), with a peak level of 7.8 ng per milliliter occurring 110 minutes after the onset of symptoms. At 27 hours after the onset of symptoms, the baseline tryptase level was 3.4 ng per milliliter.\nThe minimum acute elevation in the tryptase level that is needed to show clinical significance is determined by a formula (2+1.2\u00d7baseline trypt- ase level)10 that has been validated in the periop- erative setting.11 In this patient, the peak tryptase level exceeded the calculated cutoff (6.1 ng per milliliter), thereby supporting the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital for skin testing. Skin-prick and intradermal testing were performed at established nonirritating concentrations to evaluate for reac- tions to the suspected culprit medications that were used before the surgical procedures. The medications evaluated included fentanyl, propofol, dexamethasone, rocuronium, lidocaine, midazolam, chlorhexidine, and penicillin derivatives (piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, penicillin, ampicillin, and benzylpenicilloyl polylysine).\nSkin-prick testing was negative for all the medications. Intradermal testing was positive for piperacillin\u2013tazobactam (with the wheal measur- ing 11 mm in diameter and the flare 50 mm in diameter) at a concentration of 1 mg per millili- ter, thus establishing the diagnosis of allergy to piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. All the other tests were negative, including those for the additional peni- cillin derivatives.\n",
