    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Adith Sekaran (Medicine): A 68-year-old man with metastatic melanoma was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of fatigue and weight loss. Six years before the current evaluation, the patient received a diagnosis of su- perficial spreading melanoma of the left shoulder. He was treated with a wide local excision; a biopsy of the sentinel lymph node was negative for melanoma. One year before the current evaluation, the patient began to have slurred speech and weakness in the left hand. Imaging revealed a mass lesion in the parietal lobe of the brain and another mass in the hilum of the left lung. Craniotomy with re- section of the brain mass was performed; pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with melanoma, as did a biopsy of the lung mass. Seizures developed postoperatively, and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. Further treatment included radiation therapy targeting the parietal resec-\ntion cavity and the administration of pembrolizumab.\nFour months before the current evaluation, after seven cycles of pembrolizu- mab, the blood thyrotropin level was 9.4 \u03bcIU per milliliter (reference range, 0.4 to 5.0) and the free thyroxine level 0.9 ng per deciliter (12 pmol per liter; reference range, 0.9 to 1.8 ng per deciliter [12 to 23 pmol per liter]); treatment with levothy- roxine was initiated. Three months before the current evaluation, after eight cycles of pembrolizumab, exertional angina developed, and the patient underwent coro- nary catheterization with placement of two drug-eluting stents. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed 1 month later.\nWhen the patient presented to the oncology clinic for a planned infusion of pembrolizumab, he reported a 3-week history of fatigue and a 2-week history of increased thirst and nocturia, with a need to urinate as many as three times each night. Although there was no change in appetite or eating habits, he had lost 5 kg of weight in the previous 3 weeks. There was no headache or change in vision.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 75 beats per min- ute, the blood pressure 128/66 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was\n29.0. Heart sounds were regular, with no mur- mur. Lung sounds were normal. There was no leg edema. Muscle bulk was normal, as was strength in the arms and legs. There was no rash, bruising, or change in skin tone. Other history included  hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. Medications includ- ed aspirin, atorvastatin, clopidogrel, levetiracetam, levothyroxine, metoprolol, and pembrolizumab. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. The patient lived in New England and was a retired police officer. His father, sis- ter, and brother had had melanoma. There was no family history of diabetes.\nA complete blood count, the results of liver- function tests, and the blood thyrotropin level were normal. The blood glucose level was 505 mg per deciliter (28.03 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.89 to 6.11 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Jonathan R. Wing: This 68-year-old man with metastatic melanoma presented for a routine clinic visit, where he reported a several-week his- tory of fatigue, weight loss, polyuria, and poly- dipsia; blood testing revealed marked hypergly- cemia. The hyperglycemia occurred in the context of ongoing cancer therapy and two re- cent episodes of illness: hypothyroidism and symptomatic coronary disease. I am confident that the patient\u2019s current constellation of symp- toms can be attributed to hyperglycemia. He meets American Diabetes Association criteria for new-onset diabetes mellitus, which include clas- sic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis and a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per deciliter (11.10 mmol per liter) or higher.1\n\nNew-Onset Diabetes\nTo construct an initial differential diagnosis for this patient\u2019s new-onset diabetes, it is helpful to recall the mechanisms of glucose homeostasis. The blood glucose level is mainly regulated by insulin (secreted by pancreatic beta cells in re- sponse to hyperglycemia) and glucagon (secreted by pancreatic alpha cells in response to hypogly- cemia). Glucagon often acts in concert with other, nonpancreatic counterregulatory hormones, such as cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hormone. This patient\u2019s hyperglycemia may have been caused by insulin deficiency, insulin resistance, an excess of counterregulatory hormones, or a combination of these mechanisms, given that some conditions result in hyperglycemia through more than one of these mechanisms.\n\nInsulin Deficiency\nInsulin deficiency can be absolute (with com- plete loss of insulin production) or relative (with inadequate insulin production relative to the body\u2019s needs). Immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic beta cells eventually leads to complete loss of insulin production, resulting in type 1 diabetes mellitus. This can occur in isolation or as part of a polyglandular autoimmune syndrome associated with other endocrinopathies, such as adrenal insufficiency, thyroid disease, or hypo- gonadism. Although hypothyroidism had re- cently been identified in this patient, he did not have clinical features that would be consistent with adrenal insufficiency due to polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 2.\nOther causes of beta-cell destruction and in-\nsulin deficiency include conditions that lead to global pancreatic dysfunction, such as hemo- chromatosis, cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreati- tis, or extensive pancreatic resection. However, this patient did not have symptoms that would be consistent with pancreatic exocrine insuffi- ciency, such as abdominal cramping or steator- rhea. Defects in genes that regulate beta-cell function, insulin production, or insulin secretion can lead to clinical diabetes. The phenotypes and penetrance of these defects vary widely, but this patient\u2019s older age and absence of a family history of diabetes make this possibility unlikely.\n\nInsulin Resistance\nInsulin resistance is the body\u2019s inability to ade- quately respond to secreted insulin. Although several genetic and environmental contributors have been described, insulin resistance often oc- curs in conjunction with obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, as part of metabolic syndrome.2 Over time, insulin resistance contributes to beta- cell dysfunction and a relative insulin deficit, which manifest as hyperglycemia and lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus. This patient had hyper- tension, cardiovascular disease, and a body- mass index of 29.0, features of metabolic syn- drome that make the development of type 2 diabetes a possible explanation for his current presentation. In rare cases, the presence of ge- netic mutations that affect the insulin receptor\n \nor the formation of autoantibodies against the insulin receptor can lead to a functionally insu- lin-resistant state. These causes of insulin resis- tance are most often seen in middle-aged women who have other autoimmune disorders,3 so they are unlikely diagnoses in this patient.\n\nExcess of Counterregulatory Hormones Glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hor- mone are key hormones that are normally se- creted to increase serum glucose levels as a protective mechanism against hypoglycemia. Individually, each of these hormones can be produced inappropriately by hormone-secreting tumors or after failure of homeostatic feedback\nloops. This patient did not have the classic fea- tures of glucagonoma, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, pheo- chromocytoma, or acromegaly (syndromes caused by excessive production of glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and growth hormone, respectively), so these primary endocrinopathies are unlikely to explain his presentation. Up-regulation of these hormones can also occur in the context of criti- cal illness. Although this patient was ill, his presenting symptoms can be attributed to hyper- glycemia; there is no convincing evidence that an antecedent illness was causing hyperglycemia.\n\nMedication Use\nThe use of certain medications can cause hyper- glycemia by inducing insulin deficiency, insulin resistance, or an excess of counterregulatory hormones. The use of glucocorticoids, which have effects that mimic those of endogenous cortisol, is a very common cause of hyperglyce- mia. This patient was not taking any glucocorti- coids, but he was taking metoprolol, a beta- blocker that can cause a moderate degree of insulin resistance. He was also taking pembro- lizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the pro- grammed death 1 (PD-1) receptor expressed by T lymphocytes. Pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) amplify the body\u2019s immune response, and a myriad of adverse events can be attributed to ICI-induced autoim- munity. These immune-related adverse events can affect nearly every organ system and range in severity from mild to life-threatening.4 Among the several ICI-related endocrinopathies that have been described, ICI-induced diabetes is very rare. When it does occur, patients typically have an acute presentation with ketoacidosis, a low or undetectable level of C-peptide, and in approxi- mately half of cases, a detectable level of pan- creatic autoantibodies.5 ICI-induced thyroid dys- function is much more common, and it is possible that this patient\u2019s recent hypothyroid- ism had been related to his treatment with pem- brolizumab.\n\nKetogenesis\nThe presence of ketones in serum and urine and an elevated serum anion gap suggests the gen- eration of ketoacids. Ketogenesis occurs when cells cannot use glucose and instead rely on the metabolism of free fatty acids. This process can be associated with chronic alcoholism and severe malnutrition, two conditions in which glycogen stores are depleted, gluconeogenesis is impaired, and counterregulatory hormones are up-regu- lated. However, this patient did not drink alco- hol or have evidence of severe malnutrition.\nA third cause of ketogenesis is a nearly com- plete lack of insulin, a state that prevents cells from taking up glucose from the bloodstream. In patients with autoimmune (type 1) diabetes mellitus, acute hyperglycemia with ketosis is a common first presentation; subsequently, beta- cell destruction leads to absolute insulin defi- ciency. By contrast, patients with syndromes of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency rarely present with ketosis. It is worth noting that this patient, despite his elevated anion gap and serum ketone level, did not have acidemia. However, the venous blood gas analysis and se- rum bicarbonate level are consistent with an excess of bicarbonate, suggesting that a concur- rent metabolic alkalosis (of unclear cause) kept the serum pH in a normal range.\nIn this patient, who had an acute presenta-\ntion with new hyperglycemia and associated ketosis, autoimmune diabetes is the leading di- agnosis. Patients with classic type 1 diabetes mellitus typically first present during childhood or adolescence, and this patient was 68 years of age at symptom onset. Pembrolizumab treat- ment is his most compelling risk factor for new- onset autoimmune diabetes; I suspect that the diagnosis is ICI-induced diabetes. There is no de- finitive diagnostic test to confirm this diagno- sis, but it would be helpful to check blood levels of glycated hemoglobin, islet-cell autoantibodies, and \u2014 after treatment with insulin and stabili- zation of blood glucose levels \u2014 C-peptide.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Allison Kimball: The patient\u2019s glycated hemo- globin level had risen from 5.7% to 11.0% (refer- ence range, 4.3 to 5.6) over a period of 3 months. This increase in the glycated hemoglobin level and the rapid development of diabetes, in the absence of weight gain (which is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus) and of risk factors for pancreatic insufficiency, strongly supported a diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes. It is helpful to characterize the main subtypes of diabetes according to the detection of autoantibodies and endogenous insulin production (Fig. 1). This patient presented with positive tests for ketones in serum and urine, findings suggestive of insu- lin deficiency. The C-peptide level is a helpful marker of endogenous insulin production, but it may be falsely low in the presence of chronic hyperglycemia; therefore, measurement of the C-peptide level is typically reserved for the out- patient setting when diabetes is controlled. The next best diagnostic test is measurement of auto- antibody levels. In this case, tests for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) and islet anti- gen 2 (IA-2) autoantibodies were negative, which ruled out latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. Tests for autoantibodies may be positive or negative in patients with ICI-induced diabetes.6 ICI-induced diabetes is the most likely diagnosis.",
