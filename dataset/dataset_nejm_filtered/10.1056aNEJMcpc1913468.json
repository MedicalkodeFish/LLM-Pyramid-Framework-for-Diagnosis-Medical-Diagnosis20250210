    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Blake A. Niccum (Medicine): A 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital in the spring because of acute renal failure.\nThe patient had been generally well until 4.5 months before this admission, when fevers, malaise, mild cough, and pain in the left flank developed. He was evaluated at an outside urgent care clinic, where chest radiography was reportedly normal. A clinical diagnosis of sinusitis was made, and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was prescribed. When symptoms did not abate, doxycycline was prescribed. The flank pain was attributed to muscular strain, and a short course of prednisone and cyclobenzaprine was administered.\nFour months before this admission, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C and worsening cough developed. The patient was evaluated in an urgent care clinic at this hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 58 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/71 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed crack- les in the left lower lung field; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed faint air-space opacities in the left lower lobe and left perihilar region, and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid was pre- scribed for empirical treatment of pneumonia.\nDr. Victorine V. Muse: Two months before this admission, repeat chest radiography revealed persistence of the air-space opacity in the left perihilar region. Three weeks later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Because of a known allergy to intravenous contrast material, prednisone and diphenhydramine were administered prophylactically. The images showed centrilobular nodules and patchy opacities in both lung bases, as well as mediastinal and left hilar lymph- adenopathy (Fig. 1A and 1B).\nDr. Niccum: Two days later, early satiety, nausea, and nonbloody diarrhea developed, along with orthopnea, edema in the legs, abdominal dis- tention, decreased urine output, and weight gain. Symptoms progressed during the subsequent 3 weeks. Routine laboratory testing revealed a creatinine level of 5.78 mg per deciliter (511 mmol per liter) (normal range, 0.60 to\n1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 mmol per liter]) and a blood urea nitrogen level of 80 mg per deci- liter (29 mmol per liter) (normal range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [3 to 9 mmol per liter]). The patient was referred to the emergency department at this hospital for management of acute renal failure. The patient had a history of congenital aortic stenosis due to a subaortic membrane, hypertro- phic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, complete heart block, ascending aortic aneurysm with severe aortic insufficiency, diverticulosis, and gout. He had undergone a subaortic membrane resection when he was 10 years of age and an open revision surgery with aortic-valve repair and septal myomectomy when he was 50 years of age. When he was 52 years of age, a perma- nent pacemaker was placed after complete heart block had developed. He had undergone pulmo- nary-vein isolation when he was 58 years of age. Medications were rivaroxaban, sotalol, eplerenone, furosemide, simvastatin, potassium chloride, allo- purinol, and ibuprofen. Known medication aller- gies included intravenous iodinated contrast material, which caused hives.\nThe patient lived with his wife in a suburban\ncommunity in New England and had recently retired from a career in the information technol- ogy industry. He had traveled to Ventura County in California the preceding autumn, as well as to Europe and to the southeastern United States several years earlier. He had a 20-pack-year his- tory of cigarette smoking and had quit smoking 9 years earlier. He drank alcohol socially and had never used illicit drugs. His mother had conges- tive heart failure and his father had peripheral vascular disease. His nephew had a thoracic aortic aneurysm, and his brother had died from a ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well and was not in acute distress. The temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the blood  pressure  135/60  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 95% while he was breathing ambient air. The heart sounds were regular, and a systolic murmur  (2/6)  was  present  at  the  right  upper sternal border. There was edema in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal; spe- cifically, there were no ulcerations noted on the skin or oropharynx, and he had no rashes. Uri- nalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein, and microscopic examination of the sediment re- vealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field, including acanthocytes. Results of kidney function tests were unchanged from those obtained earlier that day; results of additional laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder revealed echogenic kid- neys but no evidence of hydronephrosis. Intrave- nous methylprednisolone was initiated empiri- cally for the treatment of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and the patient was admit- ted to this hospital.\nThe next day, additional laboratory test results were received. Tests for hepatitis B core anti- body, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, and anti- bodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern; cryoglobulins and antibodies to the Goodpasture antigen were not detected. Blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. Urine tests for Bence Jones protein were nega- tive, and results of serum protein electrophore- sis were normal. A test for antineutrophil cyto- plasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was positive, with a perinuclear staining pattern, and an enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the presence of myeloperoxidase ANCA at a titer of 743 U (reference range, <2.8). Oral cyclophos- phamide therapy was begun.\nOn hospital day 3, a central venous catheter was placed, and therapeutic plasma exchange was initiated; intravenous methylprednisolone treat- ment was discontinued, and administration of high-dose oral prednisone was begun. On hos- pital day 6, intravenous rituximab was adminis- tered. On hospital day 7, intermittent hemodialy- sis was initiated owing to persistent uremia and acidosis.\nOn hospital day 14, a fever with a temperature of up to 38.4\u00b0C developed, along with a mild cough and sore throat. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.010 and 2+ bacteria; nitrites and leukocyte esterase were not detected. On hospital day 16, the urine culture grew abundant Enterobacter cloacae, and intravenous cefepime treat- ment was initiated. After seven sessions of thera- peutic plasma exchange and administration of two rituximab infusions, the patient was dis- charged home. Prednisone (40 mg daily), cyclo- phosphamide, and ciprofloxacin were prescribed. After discharge, a fever with a temperature of  up to 38.9\u00b0C persisted, as did fatigue, malaise, and watery diarrhea. The patient also reported the development of painful oral ulcers. Two days after discharge, dyspnea on exertion developed, along with productive cough, and the patient returned to the emergency department at this\nhospital.\nOn arrival, the patient appeared ill and in respiratory distress. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure  140/70  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  54 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was receiving supplemental oxy- gen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Examination revealed numerous shallow ulcerations on the tongue and lips, dif- fuse wheezing with inspiratory crackles, and marked edema in the legs; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cytomegalovirus DNA was detected in the blood (4680 interna- tional units [IU] per milliliter). Blood samples were obtained for culture. The patient was re- admitted to this hospital.\nDr. Muse: Radiography of the chest revealed\npulmonary interstitial edema with patchy opacities in the left retrocardiac region. CT of the chest revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities with intra- lobular septal thickening and worsening medias- tinal and hilar lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1C and 1D). Dr. Niccum: Intravenous cefepime, vancomycin, and azithromycin were administered empirically. The next day, hemodialysis was performed, and 4 liters of fluid were removed by ultrafiltration for the management of congestive heart failure. During the last hour of the dialysis session, the dyspnea began to worsen and hypoxemia devel- oped; supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask. Ipratropium\u2013 albuterol nebulizers were administered, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for management of hypoxemic respiratory failure.\n\nFigure 1. CT Scan of the Chest.\nAxial CT images of the chest were obtained 2 months before this admission (Panels A and B) and again at admission (Panels C and D). By the time of admission, prevascular and subcarinal lymph nodes (arrows) had markedly increased in size.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Marwan M. Azar: This 64-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of acute renal failure after a protracted outpatient course of persistent focal pneumonia (with mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy), fever, symptoms of congestive heart failure, and constitutional symptoms. Subsequently, after he received im- munosuppressive therapy for presumed glomer- ulonephritis, severe hypoxemic respiratory fail- ure with diffuse interstitial infiltrates and oral ulcerations developed. Results of ancillary stud- ies were notable for mild eosinophilia 4 months before this admission.\nIn constructing a differential diagnosis for this\ncase, I will first consider the clinical syndromes mentioned above and notable physical examina- tion and laboratory findings independently and then in relation to one another. In addition, the patient\u2019s receipt of intense immunosuppressive therapy after his first hospital admission renders him susceptible to specific opportunistic infec- tions, and his travel to parts of the southeastern United States and southern California pose addi- tional epidemiologic risks for certain pathogens endemic in those geographic regions. Therefore, I will broaden the differential diagnosis to include relevant infections that can reactivate or dis- seminate in the context of immune suppression.\n\nPersistent Focal Pneumonia\nWhen adequately treated, the symptoms of com- munity-acquired pneumonia are usually short- lived, with fever, sputum production, and dyspnea lasting an average of 2 to 3.5 days and cough and fatigue lingering for up to 14 days.1,2 This patient\u2019s symptoms persisted for several months, despite treatment with antibiotic agents that tar- geted common bacterial pathogens. There are a variety of possible reasons for the persistence of focal pneumonia, including complications from an initial infection such as a loculated empyema, although there was no radiographic evidence for such a process in this case. In addition, atypical or unusual pathogens of pneumonia should be considered, including Legionella pneumophila, actino- myces species, nocardia, and Burkholderia pseudo- mallei; mycobacteria, including tuberculous and nontuberculous species; fungi, particularly dimor- phic pathogens; and certain parasites, such as paragonimus species. The fact that this patient had not traveled to Australasia essentially rules out melioidosis and paragonimiasis, and legionella infection and actinomyces infection are unlikely diagnoses, given the patient\u2019s lack of response to doxycycline and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, re- spectively. Prolonged respiratory symptoms cou- pled with the presence of fever and constitu- tional symptoms support a chronic process and make viral pneumonia unlikely. Noninfectious causes of lung disease, such as cryptogenic or- ganizing pneumonia, lymphoma, and sarcoido- sis, can mimic an infectious process. To further refine the differential diagnosis, I will consider this patient\u2019s persistent focal pneumonia in the context of other important findings, such as the presence of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopa- thy, mild eosinophilia, and the development of congestive heart failure and glomerulonephritis.\nMediastinal and Hilar Lymphadenopathy\nCT of the chest revealed mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy. Prominent and persistent lymphadenopathy often points to an underlying granulomatous process. Common infectious trig- gers of granulomatous inflammation include tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacteria, and dimorphic fungi, including Blastomyces dermatiti- dis, Coccidioides immitis, Coccidioides posadasii, Histo- plasma capsulatum, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Noninfectious causes of granulomatous inflam- mation include sarcoidosis, certain vasculitides and connective-tissue diseases, cryptogenic or- ganizing pneumonia, and lymphoma. The hilar lymphadenopathy was noted to be on the left side. Because chest lymphadenopathy almost always manifests bilaterally in patients with sarcoidosis (\u226595% of cases), this is an unlikely diagnosis.3\n\nEosinophilia\nCommon causes of eosinophilia include allergic conditions, particularly related to medications; certain infections, especially (but not limited to) parasitic infections; cancer; autoimmune disor- ders; and adrenal insufficiency. In the presence of persistent focal pneumonia with mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy, the detection of mild eosinophilia can help to further refine the differential diagnosis to conditions that may encompass both findings. These conditions in- clude tuberculosis, dimorphic fungi, vasculitides, and lymphoma.\n\nCongestive Heart Failure\nWhat does the development of congestive heart failure tell us about this patient\u2019s illness? Is con- gestive heart failure part of the underlying pri- mary process in a patient with a personal and family history of congenital heart and aortic disease suggestive of an inherited connective- tissue disease? Alternatively, is the development of congestive heart failure a consequence of poor baseline cardiac function in the presence of re- nal dysfunction?\nWhen we consider congestive heart failure in the context of a patient with persistent focal pneumonia and fever and constitutional symp- toms, two diagnoses should be considered: sub- acute endocarditis and acute rheumatic fever. At first glance, subacute endocarditis seems to be a viable diagnosis for this patient, although his clinical presentation does not meet any of the ma- jor modified Duke criteria4 (a heart murmur was heard on physical examination, but there was no indication that it was new) and meets only two of the minor criteria (i.e., predisposing heart con- dition and fever). Therefore, this diagnosis is un- likely. Similarly, rheumatic fever is unlikely in this patient, since none of the major revised Jones criteria5 are met, and only two of the minor cri- teria (i.e., fever and elevated inflammatory mark- ers) are met. Therefore, it seems that congestive heart failure is not intrinsic to the underlying process that is causing this patient\u2019s illness but, rather, is a likely secondary consequence.\nGlomerulonephritis\nOn the patient\u2019s first admission to this hospital, glomerulonephritis was diagnosed on the basis of renal failure, proteinuria, microscopic hema- turia, and the presence of acanthocytes on mi- croscopic examination of urine sediment. The syndrome is further qualified as normocomple- mentemic glomerulonephritis (given the normal C3 and C4 levels), ruling out membranoprolif- erative glomerulonephritis, lupus glomerulone- phritis, and most notably, postinfectious glo- merulonephritis, which I initially considered as a potential consequence of a respiratory infection. The added presence of an elevated perinuclear ANCA level strongly suggests an ANCA-associated small-vessel or medium-vessel vasculitis, partic- ularly granulomatosis with polyangiitis or eosino- philic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Such a diagnosis can indeed account for all the clinical features of this patient\u2019s presentation, including glomerulonephritis, persistent focal pneumonia with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, fever and constitutional symptoms, and eosino- philia. Oral ulcerations could be added to this list, although this finding appeared only after intense immunosuppressive therapy, which the treating clinicians instituted after having seem- ingly identified vasculitis as the underlying diag- nosis. One would expect clinical improvement after the administration of immunosuppressive therapy if the sole underlying process were a vas- culitis; however, the patient\u2019s condition worsened and hypoxemic respiratory failure developed, which arouses concern for worsening of an in- fectious process.\nHypoxemic Respiratory Failure with Diffuse Interstitial Infiltrates\nThe development of hypoxemic respiratory fail- ure with diffuse interstitial infiltrates after the administration of immunosuppressive therapy suggests a new nosocomial or opportunistic in- fection, reactivation or worsening of a latent or smoldering infection, or a noninfectious process. Certainly, the use of high-dose glucocorticoids, rituximab (a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody with B-cell\u2013depleting effects), and cyclophos- phamide (an alkylating agent) places the patient at clinically significant risk for opportunistic infection, including herpes viruses such as cyto- megalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella\u2013 zoster virus, as well as adenovirus. Although such viral infections are possible in this case, they are more common after transplantation or pregnancy (e.g., varicella\u2013zoster virus) and do not fit with this patient\u2019s clinical course before he received immunosuppressive therapy. More- over, whereas low-level cytomegalovirus viremia was detected at 4680 IU per milliliter, the me- dian viral load for patients with pneumonitis is reported to be much higher (189,013 IU per milli- liter),6 which suggests that this patient may have had reactivation of cytomegalovirus infection rather than end-organ disease. Diffuse infiltrates are a feature that is typical of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, but the short time frame between immunosuppression and clinical decompensa- tion makes this diagnosis unlikely. Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome can be manifested by respiratory failure and eosinophilia after the administration of high-dose glucocorticoids, but it is most common among immigrants and among persons who have traveled to areas of the southern United States where the syndrome is endemic and it would not explain this patient\u2019s initial clinical syndrome. Reactivation of tuber- culosis, dimorphic fungi, or C. neoformans is com- patible with this patient\u2019s presentation and war- rants further consideration.\nTuberculosis\nDoes this patient have tuberculosis that wors- ened after the use of immunosuppressive ther- apy? Although mild eosinophilia has been re- ported in association with tuberculosis, it is not a typical manifestation of the disease. However, given that the patient had not traveled to areas in which tuberculosis is endemic and did not have other risk factors, tuberculosis is an un- likely diagnosis in this case.\n\nFungal Infection\nAs with tuberculosis, reactivation of C. neofor- mans infection can explain many features of this case. Moreover, oral ulcerations are a known manifestation of cryptococcosis, and treatment with rituximab is a risk factor for the infection through inhibition of antibody-mediated opso- nization of the cryptococcal capsule. However, eosinophilia is not a manifestation of cryptococ- cal infection. Although cryptococcal disease is a possible diagnosis in this case, a fungal infec- tion such as blastomycosis or histoplasmosis is more likely. The patient did report travel to parts of the southeastern United States, an area in which both B. dermatitidis and H. capsulatum are endemic. Furthermore, oral ulcerations are asso- ciated with both conditions, particularly histo- plasmosis. However, eosinophilia is not a common finding with either diagnosis. In addition, mediastinal lymphadenopathy is uncommon with blastomycosis.7\nThe patient\u2019s presentation is also compatible with coccidioidomycosis. In contrast with other fungi, eosinophilia is common with this condi- tion.8 Moreover, oral ulcers are a manifestation. It is notable that the patient reported that he had traveled to Ventura County, California, several months before the onset of symptoms. Ventura County, which is located between Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles County, is a region in which coccidioidomycosis is moderately endemic (2.1 to 4.9 cases per 100,000 population between 2000 and 2007) and is a site of coccidioidomyco- sis outbreaks. Recently, a spike in the incidence of coccidioidomycosis in the county has been reported,9 and the local public health department issued a health advisory to local practitioners highlighting the rise in cases.10\nTherefore, on the basis of this patient\u2019s recent travel to an area in which coccidioidomycosis is moderately endemic, combined with a compatible constellation of clinical findings that worsened after immunosuppressive therapy, I think that disseminated coccidioidomycosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. To confirm this diagnosis, I would perform serologic and anti- gen testing on urine and blood for coccidioides species.\nCytologic examination of the bronchoalveolar- lavage (BAL) fluid revealed round, double-con- toured, thick-walled, endospore-filled spherules,findings that were morphologically consistent with C. immitis or C. posadasii (Fig. 2A). A cell- block preparation from the residual BAL fluid was made for additional testing; Gomori methenamine silver staining highlighted spherules and endospores with emerging filamentous tu- bular structures termed mycelia (Fig. 2B).\n",
