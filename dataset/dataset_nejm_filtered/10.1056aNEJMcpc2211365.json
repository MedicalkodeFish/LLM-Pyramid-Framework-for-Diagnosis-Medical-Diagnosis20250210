    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Nathan C. Praschan (Psychiatry): A 27-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of convulsions.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 years before this admis- sion, when shaking of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred. The episode lasted approximately 4 to 5 minutes and had been preceded by a sharp pain in the back of the head that radiated to the neck, blurred vision, palpitations, nausea, and dif- ficulty concentrating. The patient did not seek evaluation, and no additional con- vulsive episodes occurred during the subsequent 20 months.\nFour months before this admission, while the patient was drinking alcohol at    a party, his body suddenly became stiff, and he fell backward onto a table. Shak- ing of the trunk, arms, and legs occurred for approximately 5 to 8 minutes. He  had urinary incontinence but did not bite his tongue. Five minutes later, similar convulsions occurred. The patient was taken to the emergency department of an- other hospital for evaluation. The results of computed tomography of the head were normal, as was an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was obtained over a period of 40 minutes. Treatment with levetiracetam was started. The patient was discharged home with a recommendation for follow-up evaluation at the neurol- ogy clinic of the other hospital.\nThree months before this admission, the patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of the other hospital. He reported that despite the use of levetiracetam, convulsions occurred approximately once per week. The results of magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were reportedly normal. Treatment with lamo- trigine was started. There was no change in the quality or frequency of the con- vulsive episodes.\nOne month before this admission, while the patient was at work, his colleagues found him on the floor, and they witnessed \u201cshaking and clenching\u201d movements of the trunk, arms, and legs that lasted approximately 2 minutes. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency depart- ment of a second hospital for evaluation.\nAt least two additional convulsive episodes occurred at the second hospital. During one episode, the shaking movements became less intense when the physician\u2019s hand was placed on the patient\u2019s shoulder; the movements resumed at the previous intensity when the hand was re- moved. In addition, the patient\u2019s eyes were closed. When the eyelids were opened manually, no nystagmus or gaze deviation was present. When the eyelids were released, the eyes shut forcefully and Bell\u2019s phenomenon (upward devia- tion of the eyes when closing) occurred. The  patient did not speak but was able to follow simple verbal commands, such as an instruction to squeeze the physician\u2019s hands. In between the convulsive episodes, there were intermittent rocking movements of the upper body and non- rhythmic tremulous movements of the hands, and the patient did not speak or follow com- mands. After several hours, the episodes stopped, and the patient was able to speak. Admission to the hospital was recommended; however, the patient declined because of work obligations and anxiety about being in the hospital. He was dis- charged home.\nDuring the subsequent month, the patient\ncontinued to take levetiracetam and lamotrigine. However, the convulsions increased in frequency to one to three times per week.\nOn the morning before the current admis- sion, while the patient was at work, his col- leagues noticed that he abruptly stopped speak- ing and began to have shaking movements of the arms and legs. Emergency medical services were called. On their arrival, the patient\u2019s body was stiff, and there was twitching of the trunk, arms, and legs. No urinary or fecal incontinence or biting of the tongue had occurred. The patient was able to stand up from a chair and walk to the ambulance. He was brought to the emer- gency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 111/56 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was awake and alert but did not speak. His eyes were open, with a primary midline gaze and blinking in response to visual threat. His body appeared stiff, with the arms and legs straight- ened. There were intermittent nonrhythmic tremulous movements of the trunk, arms, and legs. The patient was able to follow complex commands and to move the arms and legs sym- metrically and against gravity, but there was a delay in motor activation. The deep-tendon  re-  f lexes were normal. Extensive scarring from burns was present on the face, trunk, back, arms, and legs.\nApproximately 45 minutes after the tremu- lous movements had stopped, the patient was able to speak but with limited fluency. Addi- tional history was obtained. He had been taking levetiracetam and lamotrigine as directed; how- ever, 3 days before this evaluation, he had stopped taking these medications because he was unsure whether they were effective. That morning, he had felt well until he noticed a sharp pain in the back of his head that radiated to his neck, along with sudden blurred vision, full-body numbness, and difficulty concentrating. A convulsive epi- sode then occurred that lasted up to 20 minutes; during the episode, the patient was aware of events but sometimes had difficulty hearing. He described his overall mood as \u201cpretty good\u201d and did not report decreased energy or chronic fa- tigue. There was no history of psychotic or manic symptoms, suicidal ideation, or obsessive or compulsive behaviors.\nThe patient had a history of a febrile seizure\nin childhood, as well as several concussions that had occurred while he was playing sports in childhood. He reported  that during the first  6 years of life, his social supports were limited, and he had experienced maltreatment by a fam- ily member; he did not elaborate on the nature  of the maltreatment. In late childhood, he was involved in a house fire and hospitalized for a prolonged period because of severe burns on the face, body, arms, and legs. He had asthma, major depressive disorder, chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and panic disorder with agora- phobia. He took escitalopram daily and loraze- pam as needed for panic attacks. He was in a long-term romantic relationship. He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he smoked marijuana approximately once per year and drank one alcoholic beverage per week. His fa- ther had died of heart disease when the patient was a teenager; his mother had schizoaffective disorder and post-traumatic epilepsy.\nBlood  levels of glucose and electrolytes were\nnormal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function  tests.  The  blood  lactate  level was 2.4 mmol per liter (22 mg per deciliter; ref- erence range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [5 to 20 mg per deciliter]) and the blood creatine  kinase  level 489 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were nega- tive. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. David L. Perez: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagnosis.  In this 27-year-old man, paroxysmal neurologic events with convulsions had occurred since he was 25 years of age. In developing a differential diagnosis, I will consider neurologic, medical, and psychiatric causes. In particular, I will dis- cuss conditions in five broad diagnostic catego- ries: epilepsy, paroxysmal movement disorders, intoxication and withdrawal syndromes, convul- sive syncope, and functional neurologic disorder.\n\nEpilepsy\nWhen the patient was evaluated by clinicians at the first hospital, the leading diagnosis was epi- lepsy, and treatment with an anticonvulsant  drug (levetiracetam) was started. When the pa- tient continued to have convulsions, a second medication (lamotrigine) was added. In consider- ing the diagnosis of epilepsy, some features that are often noted are the duration of the convul- sions and whether the patient had urinary incon- tinence and abnormal laboratory test results.\nMost epileptic seizures have a duration of less than 2 minutes, and it would be unusual for epileptic seizures to last 4 to 20 minutes then resolve spontaneously. Status epilepticus \u2014 which is characterized by the occurrence of ei- ther one epileptic seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes or more than one epileptic seizure within a 5-minute period with incomplete recov- ery of consciousness in between events \u2014 is a condition that reflects a failure of seizure termi- nation.1,2 Although an assessment for epilepsy usually involves an inquiry regarding urinary incontinence, this feature cannot be used to reli- ably differentiate epileptic seizures from synco- pe or functional seizures.3\nAfter convulsive epileptic seizures, the peak creatine kinase level is typically 8 to 19 times as high as the upper limit of the normal range4,5; in this patient, there was only a modest increase in the creatine kinase level. Similarly, a postictal lactate level of 2.9 mmol per liter (26 mg per deciliter) or higher has been reported to have 82% specificity in differentiating epileptic sei- zures from functional seizures6; in this patient, the lactate level was below that threshold.\nA routine EEG that was obtained while the patient was asymptomatic was normal; however, acquisition of a single EEG has only modest sen- sitivity (20 to 50%) for the detection of interictal epileptiform discharges.7 As such, the available EEG data in this patient cannot rule out the pos- sibility of epilepsy. Although I am not yet ready to rule out epileptic seizures, I have a low level of suspicion for this diagnosis, given the long duration of the events and the subthreshold cre- atine kinase and lactate levels, as well as the normal MRI results and the semiologic features of the events.\n\nParoxysmal Movement Disorders\nThis patient had convulsive events with an ele- ment of apparent preserved wakefulness that could suggest a paroxysmal movement disorder.8,9 Par- oxysmal movement disorders are rare and in- clude paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, par- oxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia, episodic ataxias, and other conditions. In patients with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, events typically begin to occur before 20 years of age, are precipitated by a movement-based trigger, have a duration of less than 1 minute, and are associated with stereo- typed movements.8 In patients with paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, events usually begin to occur in infancy or early childhood, can be precipitated by a trigger that is not movement- based (e.g., caffeine or alcohol use), have a dura- tion of minutes to hours, and are  associated with stereotyped movements.8 The spectrum of paroxysmal dyskinesia extends beyond these classic descriptions, but most conditions in this category are inherited.9 In this patient, the ab- sence of a family history of similar episodes (his mother\u2019s epilepsy was post-traumatic), the semio- logic variability, and the onset of symptoms after 20 years of age make these disorders unlikely.\n\nIntoxication and Withdrawal Syndromes\nThe possibility that the patient\u2019s symptoms were related to substance use is worth considering. At least one event occurred while he was drinking alcohol. Furthermore, events had been preceded by headache, palpitations, and nausea. The pa- tient had received a prescription for lorazepam to be taken as needed, and he had left another emergency department early because of anxiety; these aspects of his history suggest the possibil- ity of benzodiazepine misuse. Intoxication with certain drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine) and with- drawal from others (e.g., alcohol or benzodiaz- epines) have been associated with epileptic sei- zures.10 However, this patient did not have ongoing abnormalities \u2014 such as tachycardia, diaphoresis, or pupillary findings \u2014 that would support the presence of an acute intoxication or withdrawal syndrome. The negative serum and urine toxicologic panels are also not consistent with substance use.\n\nConvulsive Syncope\nBecause convulsions in this patient had been preceded by palpitations, cardiac-related convul- sive syncope is also worth considering. However, the motor symptoms in this patient lasted sev- eral minutes, whereas the motor phenomena in patients with convulsive syncope usually last less than a minute.11 The normal electrocardiogram further argues against the diagnosis of convul- sive syncope.\n\nFunctional Neurologic Disorder\nI will now consider whether this patient\u2019s symp- toms are consistent with functional seizures, a common subtype of functional neurologic disor- der.12-14 Functional seizures are also known as psychogenic nonepileptic seizures or dissociative seizures. The following semiologic features that were described by emergency department physi- cians and consulting neurologists in this case are particularly notable: the closed eyes and forceful shutting of the eyelids that occurred during a convulsive event, the pattern of non- rhythmic tremulous movements, and the decrease in the intensity of shaking movements when the physician placed a hand on the patient\u2019s shoulder, which indicated a modification of the convulsive event by interaction with an- other person.13\nIn a meta-analysis of 14  studies that involved 800 patients with epileptic seizures and 452 pa- tients with functional seizures, the presence of ictal eye closure and asynchronous limb move- ments had a moderate-to-large positive effect on the probability of functional seizures.15 In a prospective study, the ability of bystanders to alleviate or intensify seizures had a high speci- ficity (>80%) for functional seizures, as com- pared with epileptic seizures.16 In addition, when the ictal duration is 5 minutes or longer, the odds of functional seizures are approximately 24 times as high as the odds of epileptic seizures.1 Another notable feature in this case is that events were preceded by additional physical symptoms, including headache, palpitations, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. In patients with functional seizures, a phenomenon charac- terized as \u201cpanic attack without panic\u201d has been described; functional seizures can be preceded by or occur with autonomic and arousal symp- toms that are associated with panic attacks, sometimes without the emotional experience of\npanic.17-19\nThe patient\u2019s history of psychiatric conditions and childhood maltreatment does not feature prominently in my consideration of the differen- tial diagnosis. Mental health conditions are common among patients with functional seizures and among patients with epileptic seizures.20,21 A history of childhood maltreatment is common among patients with functional neurologic dis- order but is not always present.22 Furthermore, approximately one in five patients with func- tional seizures also has epileptic seizures, so careful consideration of the semiologic features in each patient is warranted.23\nTaken together, this patient\u2019s clinical history, semiologic features, and available EEG data meet the criteria for a probable diagnosis of func- tional seizures, as defined in a consensus state- ment by the International League Against Epi- lepsy (Table 1).24 Given the high event frequency, I would recommend inpatient admission for continuous video EEG monitoring to capture clinical events in order to provide additional di- agnostic certainty.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Daniel B. Hoch: The patient was admitted for continuous video EEG monitoring to be per- formed over a period of 3 days. For patients who are already taking anticonvulsant  drugs,  inpa-  tient admission is preferred to allow for safe tapering of the drugs and immediate availability of staff during clinical events. This patient re- ported that he had stopped taking anticonvul- sant drugs 3 days before the admission.\nDuring the admission, the patient\u2019s typical symptoms occurred three times. During the first episode, the patient noticed being awakened by  a noise and looking at the cardiac monitor. The nurse who entered the room noticed that the patient appeared confused but was able to follow a verbal command to point to the window; when he was asked to point to the door, he did not respond. The second episode occurred with photic stimulation. When the patient was exposed to a flickering light, he closed his eyes, moved his head from left to right, and became unresponsive. After 3 minutes, he reported that he was \u201ccoming out of a seizure.\u201d The third episode occurred on the final day of monitoring. The patient pushed the alarm button and reported that he was feeling shaky. When the nurse asked if he was having his typical convulsive symp- toms, he said \u201cyes.\u201d The patient then stopped interacting with the nurse and the physician who had entered the room. He closed his eyes, raised his right hand to touch his nose, and kept his hand in place. When the physician tried to gently raise the patient\u2019s eyelids, Bell\u2019s phenom- enon occurred. The continuous video EEG re- cording remained normal during the three epi- sodes of symptoms (Fig. 1), a finding that confirmed the diagnosis of functional seizures.\n",
