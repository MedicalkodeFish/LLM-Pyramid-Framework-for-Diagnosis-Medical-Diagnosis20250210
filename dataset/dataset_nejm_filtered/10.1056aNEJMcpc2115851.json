    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Samantha D. Martin (Pediatrics): A 17-year-old girl was admitted to this hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic because of fever and cough.\nThe patient had been well until 10 days before admission, when fever and cough that was productive of clear sputum developed. She also had fatigue, eye redness, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and myalgias.\nSeven days before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the urgent care clinic of another hospital. On examination, there was conjunctival injection in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder of the physical examination was reportedly normal. Testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. Treatment with acetaminophen and dextromethorphan was recommended.\nDuring the next 2 days, the fever decreased but did not resolve with the use of acetaminophen. New mild chest discomfort occurred with coughing. An expecto- rated sputum specimen contained flecks of blood, and the patient returned to the urgent care clinic. The physical examination was unchanged, and rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. Additional treatment with ibu- profen, benzonatate, and guaifenesin was recommended.\nThree days before this admission, the patient had persistent symptoms and was unable to sleep because of the fever and cough. New shortness of breath devel- oped. She was evaluated by a primary care physician at the other hospital in a telehealth visit. Empirical treatment with amoxicillin was started, and close monitoring was recommended. During the next 3 days, the shortness of breath increased in severity, and the patient was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported cough that was worse with exertion and deep breathing, improved with rest, and was associated with pain in the chest and back on the left side. The sputum had streaks of bright red blood. Other symptoms included fatigue, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, myalgias, and pain in both knees when walking. The eye redness had resolved, but there was mild soreness of the right eye. There was no headache, ear pain, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.\nThe patient had a history of developmental dysplasia of the hip and was otherwise healthy. She had normal growth and development and had received all routine childhood vaccinations. Medications included amoxicillin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, benzonatate, guaifenesin, and dextro- methorphan. There were no known drug aller- gies. The patient was born in New England and lived in a suburban area of New England with her mother, father, and brother. She performed well in high school, which she was attending remotely because of the Covid-19 pandemic; she had no known sick contacts. She had traveled to a Caribbean island 1 year earlier. She was a veg- etarian and did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her parents and brother were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.5\u00b0C,\nthe heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 142/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.9. The patient appeared pale, and she coughed and sniffled frequently. She did not use accessory muscles while breathing, and breath sounds in the lower lung fields were decreased. There was no conjunctival injection, lymphade- nopathy, joint swelling or tenderness, or rash; the remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nThe creatinine level was 2.00 mg per deciliter (177 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the C-reactive protein level 77.5 mg per liter (ref- erence value, <8.0).  The hemoglobin level was\n6.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), the hematocrit 21.1% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0), the white-cell count 11,890 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), and the plate- let count 526,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein; microscopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed more than 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to\n2)  and 10  to 20 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), as well as mixed granular casts and red-cell casts. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2, in- fluenza types A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed, and blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Randheer Shailam: Chest radiography (Fig. 1A and 1B) revealed prominent patchy opacities in the lower lung zones. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed peripheral patchy ground-glass opacification with greater involvement of the lower lobes than of the upper lobes, the lingula (left lung), and the middle lobe (right lung). There were also areas of normal-appearing lung. These findings are not specific and can be seen with infectious causes such as bacterial pneumo- nia and Covid-19, as well as with noninfectious causes such as aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage, and less likely, alveolar proteinosis.\n\nTable 1.

Chest Imaging Studies.\nFrontal and lateral radiographs of the chest (Panels A and B, respectively) show patchy airspace opacities, predomi\u2011 nantly in the lower lung zones (see boxes). On the lateral radiograph, the opacities are most prominent in the mid\u2011 to\u2011posterior aspect of the lungs. There is no evidence of pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Axial re\u2011 formatted CT images of the chest (Panels C and D), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show peripheral patchy ground\u2011glass opacification with greater involvement of the lower lobes than of the upper lobes, the lingula (left lung), and the middle lobe (right lung). Coronal reformatted CT images (Panels E and F) show a posterior distribution of opacities.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mary C. Ottolini: This previously healthy teen- age girl with obesity presented to the emergency department during the Covid-19 pandemic with prolonged fever, cough, fatigue, and other symp- toms of upper respiratory infection. Conjunctivi- tis had occurred and resolved in both eyes, with residual pain in the right eye. Pleuritic pain and dyspnea had developed. The cough, which had initially been productive of clear sputum, had progressed to hemoptysis.\nOn the basis of the patient\u2019s history and physi- cal examination, the predominant problems that warranted hospitalization were the prolonged unexplained fever with progression to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the he- moptysis. In developing a differential diagnosis, I will first consider causes of prolonged fever, including infections and autoimmune diseases that are associated with a systemic inflamma- tory response. Although a 10-day history of fever is unusual for a typical viral process, it does not meet criteria to be classified as a fever of un- known origin.1,2\nOther features of the patient\u2019s presentation that will ultimately need to be explained are hemoptysis and bilateral conjunctivitis with re- sidual eye pain. Hemoptysis can be due to capil- laritis from necrotizing pneumonia; it can also be a component of systemic vasculitis.3,4 Self-re- solving bilateral conjunctivitis with residual eye pain is an unusual finding that could reflect anterior eye inflammation as a manifestation of systemic inflammatory disease.5\nIn addition, several notable laboratory findings need to be considered, including severe anemia with a normal white-cell count, an increased plate- let count, and mildly elevated results of coagulation tests. The red-cell indexes and a description of the morphologic features of the red cells are not provided; these could be helpful in the evalu- ation of anemia.\n\nCauses of Anemia and Other Findings\nThe most likely causes of anemia in a previously healthy adolescent girl are bone marrow suppres- sion due to prolonged illness, hemolysis due to oxidative stress in the presence of glucose-6-phos- phate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or iron- deficiency anemia due to previously undiagnosed menorrhagia. Blood loss from pulmonary hemorrhage is also possible but does not seem likely initially, given the description of the hemoptysis as \u201cflecks\u201d and \u201cstreaks\u201d of blood rather than substantial bleeding.\nUrinalysis showed an active sediment with clinically significant amounts of blood, protein, and red-cell casts. Blood testing showed evidence of kidney injury, including an elevated creatinine level. A ratio of urea nitrogen to creatinine of more than 10 and the presence of blood, protein, and red-cell casts in urine are features consis- tent with a diagnosis of glomerulonephritis. An elevated lactate dehydrogenase level could be due to hemolysis, vasculitis, or muscle or liver injury. A C-reactive protein level almost 10 times the upper limit of the normal range is indicative of severe systemic inflammation. Patchy opacities in the lower lobes could be due to pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\nAdenovirus Infection and Bacterial Pneumonia\nInfection with adenovirus, especially adenovirus serotype 14, begins with symptoms of upper respiratory infection, arthralgias, and myalgias and can cause clinically significant inflamma- tion of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva. Adenovirus serotype 14 infection has been associ- ated with fatal necrotizing pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and hemoptysis.6 In this patient, the bilateral patchy opacities are consistent with dif- fuse pulmonary inflammation. The severe anemia and coagulation abnormalities are not consistent with adenovirus infection, and acute glomerulo- nephritis due to adenovirus infection is extreme- ly rare.7\nAdenovirus and other viral infections can be complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia,which is often due to Staphylococcus aureus or Strep- tococcus pyogenes. Secondary bacterial pneumonia can cause prolonged fever and hemoptysis, espe- cially if it is complicated by empyema or abscess. In this patient, the absence of focal consolidation or effusion on chest imaging makes bacterial pneumonia unlikely. The anemia was more severe than would be expected with bone marrow sup- pression due to infection, although such severe anemia could be due to hemolysis in the pres- ence of G6PD deficiency. The coagulation abnor- malities could be due to disseminated intravas- cular coagulation or sepsis, but these conditions are associated with a more ill appearance and an elevated white-cell count with a left shift. Postin- fectious glomerulonephritis can occur after infec- tion with certain nephritogenic group A strepto- cocci, but the onset would be a bit early if the bacterial infection occurred several days into the viral infection.8\n\nCovid-19 and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\nThis patient had some risk factors for severe complications of Covid-19, including her age (i.e., the fact that she was not a young child) and obesity.9,10 The respiratory issues, including he- moptysis, and the systemic symptoms \u2014 pro- longed fever, arthralgias, myalgias, and fatigue\n\u2014 are classic features of Covid-19. The findings on chest radiography are also consistent with Covid-19, but if the diffuse pneumonitis were due to Covid-19, hypoxia would be expected by the time of her presentation to the emergency de- partment.11,12 Severe anemia and glomerulone- phritis are not common findings seen with acute Covid-19, and persistent unilateral eye pain is also unusual.\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in chil- dren (MIS-C) due to Covid-19 is a possible diag- nosis in this case, given the multiorgan systemic involvement and evidence of severe inflamma- tion. The patient met some of the established criteria for MIS-C, including an age younger than 21 years, a temperature higher than 38\u00b0C for at least 24 hours, and laboratory evidence of inflammation.13 She had a severe illness with involvement of the renal, respiratory, and hema- tologic systems that led to hospitalization. In- volvement of the cardiac and gastrointestinal systems is common with MIS-C, whereas the type of renal and hematologic involvement de-\n \n\nscribed in this patient is atypical.14 Renal injury due to acute tubular necrosis from inadequate perfusion is more common than acute glomeru- lonephritis.15 The onset of fever is earlier than would be expected with MIS-C, which typically develops a minimum of 2 weeks after the onset of Covid-19 symptoms.16,17 Furthermore, this pa- tient had multiple negative tests for Covid-19 and had no known exposure, since she was attending school remotely.\n\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\nThis patient had many findings consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including severe inflammation, prolonged fever, arthralgias, fatigue, glomerulonephritis, and coagulopathy.18 The pulmonary opacities, hemoptysis, and ane- mia are also consistent with this diagnosis, al- though pleural effusions are more common than pulmonary opacities alone.19 SLE often occurs in adolescent girls, but it is usually associated with an insidious onset of symptoms, whereas this patient had a relatively acute symptom onset. Also, the conjunctivitis with residual eye pain is an uncommon manifestation. To establish the diagnosis of SLE on the basis of the 2012 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics criteria, a patient must meet at least four of the clinical criteria and have associated labo- ratory findings, unless there is a histologic diag- nosis of lupus nephritis.20 This patient met only three of the clinical criteria \u2014 hemolytic ane- mia, kidney disease, and joint (knee) inflamma- tion \u2014 which makes the diagnosis of SLE un- likely. However, it is important to perform a laboratory evaluation to determine whether au- toantibodies associated with SLE are present.\n\nGranulomatosis with Polyangiitis\nThis patient met the 2008 criteria for the diag- nosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) from the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology, Pediatric Rheumatology Interna- tional Trials Organization, and Pediatric Rheu- matology European Society.21 To establish the diagnosis of GPA, a patient must meet at least three of the following six criteria: lung involve- ment,22 kidney involvement,23 upper airway in- volvement, inflammation of the laryngotracheo- bronchial tract, a positive test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and granuloma- tous inflammation located in an arterial wall or in the perivascular or extravascular space. This patient had involvement of the lungs (bilateral patchy infiltrates and hemoptysis), kidneys (glo- merulonephritis), and upper airway (prolonged rhinorrhea and nasal congestion). In addition, her  systemic  inflammatory response  with fever and coagulopathy and her severe anemia that was determined to be due to pulmonary hemor- rhage are consistent with a diagnosis of GPA. It would be helpful to know more about her \u201cconjunctivitis\u201d to determine whether it was due to inflammation of the anterior chamber or an in- fectious process. The acute onset of GPA in a previously healthy girl is a bit unusual, but there have been case reports of acute infections that uncover an evolving ANCA-associated vasculi- tis.24 Although additional laboratory tests would help to refine the differential diagnosis, the de- finitive test in this case would be a kidney bi- opsy to establish the cause of the kidney disease.",
