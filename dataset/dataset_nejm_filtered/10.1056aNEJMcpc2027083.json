    "Primary Symptom": "A 24-Year-Old Man with Headache and Covid-19",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Stephanie M. Shatzman (Medicine): A 24-year-old man was admitted to this hos- pital in the spring of 2020 because of headache and coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 3 weeks before this ad- mission, when fatigue, generalized weakness, and headache developed. He also had myalgias, nausea, and vomiting but no fever, cough, or diarrhea. Ibuprofen and aspirin did not alleviate the symptoms.\nTwo weeks later, headache and weakness persisted and new shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, and anorexia developed. Five days before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at a local urgent care clinic. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Physical examina- tion was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained to test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Intramuscular ketorolac was ad- ministered, and the patient was discharged home with recommendations to quar- antine.\nThe next day, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the nasopharyngeal swab, and the patient had a telemedicine visit through the urgent care clinic. He reported headache, nausea, anorexia, and weakness. Four days later, the headache wors- ened, and he had presyncope; he sought evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, multiple episodes of vomiting oc- curred. The patient described headache and pain localized behind the eyes, as well as persistent shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. There was no fever, cough, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The patient had undergone an appendectomy during childhood; he reported no other known medical conditions, was taking no medications, and had no known allergies to medications.\nThe patient was born in Central America and was a university student there when he immigrated to the United States 3 months before admission. He worked in landscaping. He had had heterosexual contacts before immigration and reported that he had used condoms. He did not smoke tobacco or electronic cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He lived in an apartment in an urban area of Massachusetts with nine other people, including his brother and sister and their families. The patient did not know his family medical history.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/90 mm Hg, the heart rate 62 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was\n21.3. The patient appeared fatigued, diaphoretic, and lethargic. He was intermittently agitated and increasingly somnolent, falling asleep mul- tiple times during a conversation. He frequently squeezed his eyes closed and used his hands to hit his head, stating that it hurt. The pupils were equal and reactive to light; there was no nuchal rigidity. He was alert and oriented and followed commands. Cranial nerve examination was nor- mal, but rotation of the head or lifting of the leg caused pain in the head, eyes, and neck. The lungs were clear. The remainder of the examina- tion was normal.\nResults of urinalysis and urine and  blood\ntoxicologic screening were normal. Other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography revealed no opacities. Acetamino- phen and intravenous fluids were administered. Ninety minutes later, the patient was found  on the ground next to the stretcher, on his hands and knees, incontinent of urine. Intrave- nous  vancomycin,  ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were\nadministered empirically.\nDr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or large in- farct. There was subtle hypodensity of the basal ganglia. There was posterior flattening of both globes and a partially empty sella turcica. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed posterior flattening of both globes and tapering of the transverse sinuses. T2-weighted images and T2- weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed multiple small hyperintense foci in the caudate nuclei and putamina (Fig. 1); sev- eral foci appeared to be cystic. In addition, there were scattered hyperintense foci in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of the fron- tal lobes and the anterior corona radiata.\nDr. Shatzman: Lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was higher than 55 cm of water, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was colorless. On CSF analysis, the total protein level was 47 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55), and the glucose level 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deci- liter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). There were 108 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 81% were lymphocytes and 18% were monocytes.\nThe patient was admitted to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU) 17 hours after presenta- tion.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Howard M. Heller: This 24-year-old man pre- sented with a 3-week history of indolent pro- gression of headache and respiratory and gastro- intestinal symptoms. Four days before admission, he had received a diagnosis of Covid-19. He did not have a fever, and the results of physical exami- nation were consistent with signs of meningeal inflammation. He had very slight absolute lymphopenia and mild anemia. Lumbar puncture was notable for an elevated opening pressure, and CSF analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis, a slight- ly low glucose level, and a normal protein level. There are numerous epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory clues in this case. We need to sort out which of these might be \u201cred herrings,\u201d or distractions unrelated to the diagnosis, and to avoid anchoring and being misled by other clues.\n\nCovid-19\nCould this patient\u2019s illness be attributed to Covid-19? During the Covid-19 pandemic, this diagnosis has certainly been on the minds of clinicians and patients. This patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while he was breathing ambient air, and a chest radiograph showed no opacities. If he had a decreased oxygen satura- tion with activity and diffuse ground-glass opac- ities on chest radiography, then CT of the chest would be appropriate, since it is a sensitive meth- od for the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia.\nCovid-19 has been associated with a hyperco- agulable state that can lead to pulmonary em- boli, but this patient had a normal d-dimer level, a finding that makes pulmonary emboli unlikely. In addition, Covid-19 has been associated with encephalitis, but Covid-19 encephalitis usually occurs in the presence of severe pulmonary dis- ease and is typically associated with frontotem- poral hypoperfusion, leptomeningeal enhance- ment, or evidence of strokes on MRI.1,2 Venous sinus thrombosis can occur in patients with Covid-19, but there is no evidence of venous si- nus thrombosis on MRI in this patient. I think Covid-19 is a coincidental diagnosis in this case and is not the most likely cause of the neuro- logic illness.\nTickborne Diseases\nWhenever we hear the words \u201clandscaper\u201d or \u201chiking in New England,\u201d we tend to anchor on tickborne diseases, especially in the spring. As a landscaper, the patient was not able to work from home during the shutdown for the Covid-19 pandemic. When headache is the predominant symptom, we need to be concerned about cere- bral vasculitis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. However, in the absence of fever and rash 3 weeks into the illness, this diagnosis is unlikely.\nThe patient did not have leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated aminotransferase levels, so anaplasmosis is not a major diagnostic con- sideration. He had mild anemia but normal as- partate aminotransferase and lactate dehydroge- nase levels; these findings point us away from an infection that causes hemolysis, such as ba- besiosis. Furthermore, neither anaplasmosis nor babesiosis would cause the central nervous sys- tem (CNS) findings seen in this patient.\nBorrelia miyamotoi can cause severe, some- times relapsing, febrile illness and lymphocytic meningitis. Powassan virus can cause encepha- litis and meningitis, but these manifestations usually involve the temporal lobes rather than the basal ganglia. No cases of infection with Powassan virus or any arbovirus were reported in Massachusetts during the first 6 months of 2020, when this patient\u2019s illness occurred.\nEarly disseminated Lyme borreliosis can cause lymphocytic meningitis, and increased intracra- nial pressure with pseudotumor cerebri has been described, but these manifestations are more common in children than adults.3 Lyme enceph- alitis can lead to a variety of MRI findings but not the abnormalities described in this case.4,5 Another occupational hazard for landscapers is sporotrichosis, which can cause lymphocytic meningitis, but this patient did not have the skin lesions typically associated with this infection.6\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nAlthough this patient\u2019s sexual history is not par- ticularly suggestive of sexually transmitted in- fections, we need to consider this possibility, since some patients are initially reluctant to share details of their sexual history. The sexu- ally transmitted infections that can cause lym- phocytic meningitis include acute human im- munodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus type 2 infection. The patient did not have any relevant findings on examination, such as oral or genital sores or an erythematous rash.\n\nOther Infections\nGiven that this patient had recently immigrated to the United States, we need to consider possi- ble diagnoses linked to Central America. Tuber- culosis can cause meningitis with mononuclear pleocytosis, but with this infection, the CSF pro- tein level is typically much higher than the level seen in this patient. In addition, he had no calci- fied granulomata on chest imaging; on brain imaging, we would be likely to see signs of meningitis or tuberculomas but not cystic-appear- ing lesions located in the basal ganglia. Cysticer- cosis is typically associated with either multiple, scattered enhancing cysts surrounded by edema in patients with active disease or calcifications of old cysts. Toxoplasmosis often involves the basal ganglia but typically causes ring-enhanc- ing lesions with edema in immunocompromised patients. Chagas\u2019 disease can cause meningoen- cephalitis and focal lesions during reactivation of infection in immunocompromised  patients. Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in Central America, but neurologic involvement is uncom- mon and ring-enhancing lesions are usually seen. Coccidioidomycosis commonly causes meningi- tis, even in immunocompetent people, and al- though it is not endemic in Central America, we are not told how the patient traveled from Cen- tral America to Massachusetts; many immigrants undergo an arduous journey through the Sonoran Desert in northwestern Mexico. Both histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis can cause lymphocytic meningitis and are possible diagnoses in this case.7 Finally, because the patient did not have a fever and his inflammatory markers were not markedly abnormal, we need to consider nonin- fectious causes, specifically CNS lymphoma.\n\nCryptococcosis\nThe condition that is most commonly associated with a cystic, grapelike appearance in the brain, especially in the basal ganglia, and typically causes a very high intracranial pressure is cryp- tococcosis.8 Cryptococcal meningitis can occur in seemingly healthy people, but it usually occurs in people who are much older than this patient; it most commonly occurs in immuno- suppressed patients, especially in the presence of advanced HIV infection. This patient had no identifiable risks for HIV infection or relevant findings on examination, such as thrush or lymphadenopathy. Hypergammaglobulinemia is a hallmark of the humoral dysregulation associ- ated with HIV infection, especially at the late stage, but this patient\u2019s globulin level and albumin:globulin ratio were normal.9 In addi- tion, his history was not suggestive of hypogam- maglobulinemia or another underlying immuno- deficiency. Given that this patient\u2019s presentation is most consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, I suspect that he also has a new diagnosis of advanced HIV infection. To establish these diag- noses, I would perform a CSF test for cryptococ- cal antigen and a fungal wet preparation. If cryptococcal disease is identified, the patient will need to undergo evaluation for an underlying immunodeficiency, including an HIV test. If the HIV test is negative, characterization of T-cell subsets by flow cytometry should be performed to rule out idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Tasos Gogakos: The first diagnostic test in this case was Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF specimen after centrifugation, which revealed the presence of small, round gram-positive organisms (Fig. 2A). At higher magnification, these organisms were of various sizes, well circumscribed, and sur- rounded by a salmon hue, with some of them budding on a narrow base (Fig. 2B). The forms were not abutting one another; this finding is indicative of an encapsulated organism. A fun- gal wet preparation revealed fungal forms with circumferential clearance (Fig. 2C). A latex ag- glutination test for cryptococcal antigen was positive, with a titer of 1:8192. Culture of the CSF specimen on a blood agar plate showed growth of small, translucent, glistening mucoid colonies after 2 days of incubation (Fig. 2D). The isolate was identified as Cryptococcus neoformans by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time-of-f light (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.\nCryptococcal infection usually occurs in the presence of severe immunosuppression charac- teristic of advanced HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection (CD4+ T-cell count, <50) and is often associated with an elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture.10 To assess the immunocompetence of this patient, HIV testing was performed. A com- bined antigen and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody screen was positive, and the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection was confirmed with the use of an HIV differentiation assay. The HIV-1 RNA viral load was 138,000 copies per milliliter. The CD4+ T-cell count was 16 per microliter, establishing the diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syn- drome (AIDS).\nHIV-positive immunocompromised patients are at an increased risk for opportunistic CNS infections, such as cryptococcal meningitis, cere- bral toxoplasmosis, and tuberculous meningi- tis.11 Antitoxoplasma IgG antibodies were de- tected in this patient, but in light of the radiologic findings, cerebral toxoplasmosis was considered to be unlikely. Mycobacterial cultures of blood and CSF specimens were negative, as was an enzyme-linked immunospot assay for interferon-\u03b3.\n\n",
