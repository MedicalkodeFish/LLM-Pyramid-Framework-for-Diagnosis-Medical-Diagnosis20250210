    "Primary Symptom": "A 72-Year-Old Woman with Dark Urine and Weakness",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Julian S. Haimovich (Medicine): A 72-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic heart disease was evaluated at this hospital because of weakness and dark urine. The patient had been in her usual state of health, which included recreational swimming and hiking, until 3 weeks before this admission, when she noted an abrupt onset of dark, rust-colored urine after a trip to Europe. During her trip, she had increased her intake of alcohol. She had no other bleeding symptoms and reported no dysuria, abdominal pain, anorexia, weight change, nausea, emesis, or antecedent trauma; she took no nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Dark urine occurred with every instance of urination. She decided on her own to reduce her dose of warfarin, which she had been taking for 25 years after me- chanical mitral-valve and aortic-valve replacements, and to take one dose of cipro-\nfloxacin, which had been left over from a previous prescription.\nOne week later, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. Ex- amination was notable for a slightly sallow complexion. The blood levels of elec- trolytes, glucose, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine dipstick testing was positive for blood, and a urine specimen was obtained for culture.\nTen days later, the patient reported fatigue with activity, and imaging studies were performed. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, per- formed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed only a punctate nonobstructing renal stone in the left kidney. Outpatient cystoscopy was reportedly unrevealing.\nFour days later, the fatigue increased, and the patient reported feeling \u201cvery weak,\u201d with exertional dyspnea manifesting as a \u201chard time with walking\u201d; her husband noted that she appeared pale, and she presented to her primary care physician for additional evaluation. Examination revealed a systolic murmur and skin pallor. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, the hapto- globin level was undetectable, and the levels of folate and vitamin B12 were normal; other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, after the results became available, the pa- tient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for pale and yellow skin, generalized weakness, and dyspnea on modest exertion. The patient reported that her arms and legs felt heavy, without pain or pares- thesia. There was no chest pain or pressure, pal- pitations, edema, or orthopnea. She reported no bleeding from the oropharynx, nose, vagina, or rectum and no bruising. There were no fevers, chills, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, respi- ratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or other genitourinary symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, resection of breast ductal carcinoma along with axillary lymph-node dissection, and rheumatic fever during adoles- cence. Two decades after having rheumatic fever, she had severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis with moderate mitral regurgita- tion that was complicated by heart failure, exer- cise intolerance, and pulmonary hypertension; she underwent mechanical bileaflet tilting-disk aortic-valve and mitral-valve replacements 25 years before this admission. Medications included warfarin and atorvastatin. Her warfarin treat- ment was managed by a local clinic, and her international normalized ratio (INR) was checked approximately every 3 to 4 weeks; his- torically, her INRs were within the range of 2.0 to 2.5. There were no adverse reactions to either medication. She lived with her husband and was a former teacher. She was active and enjoyed swimming and hiking. She did not smoke or use illicit substances; she drank wine in social set- tings. There was no family history of cardiac, renal, or hematologic disease.\nThe temperature was 36.2\u00b0C, the heart rate\n96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 144/65 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 22.9. On examination, she appeared pale and mildly jaundiced but otherwise generally well. Examination of the eyes revealed scleral icterus. There was no evidence of bleeding, petechiae, or ecchymoses in the oropharynx or on the skin. The jugular venous pressure was 10 cm of water. Ausculta- tion revealed crisp metallic S1 and S2 sounds, a crescendo\u2013decrescendo systolic murmur (grade 1/6)  at  the  right  upper  sternal  border,  a  harsh systolic  murmur  (grade  3/6)  at  the  apex,  and clear lungs. There was no organomegaly or supra- pubic tenderness. No enlarged lymph nodes were identified. Distal pulses were intact, the hands and feet were warm, and there was no edema. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, lactate,\ntotal protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, vitamin B12, and folate were normal, as were the results of tests of renal function; other labora-\ntory test results are shown in Table 1. An elec- trocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, borderline R-wave progression in the precordial leads, and submillimeter ST-segment depressions in the lateral leads.\nDr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: An anteroposterior ra- diograph of the chest (Fig. 1A) showed sternal wires, chondrocalcinosis, and clear lungs, as well as enlargement of the left atrium. The valve prostheses were not well visualized.\nDr. Haimovich: Point-of-care cardiac ultrasonog- raphy that was performed in the emergency de- partment reportedly revealed normal biventricu- lar function, no evidence of pericardial effusion, and a possible clot on the mitral valve. Intrave- nous heparin was administered, and the patient was admitted to the cardiology inpatient unit.\nDr. Mayooran Namasivayam: On the second day of hospitalization, a transthoracic echocardio- gram (Fig. 1B and 1C) showed nondilated left and right ventricles with normal systolic function and mobile chordae tendineae in the left ventricular cavity consistent with pre- vious mitral-valve replacement. The mechanical aortic prosthesis was well seated with a mean transaortic pressure gradient of 14 mm Hg and with mild regurgitation. The mechanical mitral prosthesis was well seated with extensive perim- itral annular calcification that extended to the mitral subvalvular apparatus but did not inter- fere with the opening and closing of the prosthetic mitral-valve disks, without evidence of thrombosis on the valve. The mean transmitral pressure gradient was 4 mm Hg measured at 80 beats per minute. Mitral regurgitation could not be assessed owing to acoustic reverberation and shadowing. Mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgi- tation was present with an estimated right ven- tricular systolic pressure of 45 mm Hg. There was no echocardiographic evidence of pulmo- nary-valve disease, ventricular septal defect, left ventricular outflow obstruction, or pericardial effusion. The inferior vena cava was not dilated and collapsed well with inspiration.\nDr. Haimovich: The fibrinogen level was normal, and the haptoglobin level was undetectable. Other laboratory test results are shown in Ta- ble 1. The hematology service was consulted; a peripheral-blood smear showed normal red cells with mild central pallor, 1 schistocyte per high- power field with numerous reticulocytes, and normal white cells and platelets.\n\nTable 1.

Initial Chest Radiograph and Transthoracic Echocardiogram.\nA posteroanterior radiograph (Panel A) shows left atrial enlargement. The valve prostheses are not well visualized, in part because of the presence of chondrocalcinosis. On transthoracic echocardiography, an apical two\u2011chamber view (Panel B) shows perivalvular and submitral calcification (orange arrows), which does not interfere with the movement of the mechanical mitral\u2011valve bileaflet tilting\u2011disk prosthesis (purple arrow). There is symmetric opening and closing of the mitral\u2011valve disks, as inferred from the appearance of symmetric acoustic reverberation from the prosthetic disk motion (red arrow). An acoustic shadow (blue arrow) cast by the perivalvular and sub\u2011 mitral calcification is also noted. A color Doppler image (Panel C) shows the reverberation and shadowing of the mechanical mitral\u2011 valve prosthesis (arrow) that is preventing adequate assessment of any potential mitral regurgitation by color Doppler. LA denotes left atrium, and LV left ventricle.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Rajeev Malhotra: This 72-year-old woman presented with acute-to-subacute weakness, dark urine, and anemia. Her symptoms were associ- ated with jaundice and a harsh apical systolic murmur. Her medical history was notable for mechanical mitral-valve and aortic-valve replace- ments 25 years before this admission, after she had had rheumatic fever as an adolescent. The primary laboratory abnormality in this patient was anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g per deciliter at the time of hospital admission, as compared with a level of 12.5 g per deciliter 15 days before admission. There was no evidence of a source of bleeding on cystoscopy or any other overt bleed clinically, and although anticoagula- tion therapy with warfarin had been adminis- tered, her INR was subtherapeutic at the time of hospital admission. Initial urinalysis revealed large amounts of blood with only 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field, findings that were consistent with hemoglobinuria (or myoglobin- uria) rather than hematuria. In addition, given the undectectable haptoglobin level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, reticulocytosis, and unconjugated bilirubinemia, this patient\u2019s pre- sentation is most consistent with symptomatic hemolytic anemia.\nHemolytic Anemia\nThe causes of hemolytic anemia can be grouped into two main categories according to the loca- tion of hemolysis. Extravascular hemolysis is characterized by the premature phagocytosis of red cells by macrophages in the spleen and other reticuloendothelial tissues due to immunemediated destruction, hypersplenism, abnormali- ties in red-cell deformability, or hemoglobinopa- thies. Intravascular hemolysis occurs as a result of direct mechanical trauma to red cells, toxins, a microangiopathic process, or a complementmediated immune process. In the context of severe intravascular hemolysis, a large amount of free hemoglobin is released into the circula- tion, after which the hemoglobin is bound and cleared by haptoglobin. The presence of both a low haptoglobin level and marked hemoglobin- uria favors a diagnosis of intravascular hemolysis.\nTo identify the cause of hemolytic anemia, examination of a peripheral-blood smear is typi- cally performed. This patient\u2019s clinical history suggested an acute, acquired process, and this was further confirmed by the absence of sickle cells and elliptocytes on a peripheral-blood smear, which, if present, would have indicated a hereditary process. Furthermore, spherocytes were not present on the blood smear and a direct antiglobulin test was negative, arguing against the presence of hereditary spherocytosis or anti- body-mediated causes of hemolytic anemia such as drug-induced hemolytic anemia or an under- lying autoimmune disease. Moreover, the absence of a recent history of fever, infectious mononu- cleosis or mycoplasma infection, blood transfu- sion, or active cancer makes autoimmune hemo- lytic anemia an unlikely diagnosis. In addition, there was no history of recent receipt of medica- tions that are known to cause drug-induced hemo- lytic anemia, such as \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors or NSAIDs.1 The combination of glucose-6-phos- phate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency with oxidative stress from receipt of agents such as dapsone, nitrofurantoin, or quinolones or inges- tion of fava beans can precipitate hemolysis.2 Although this patient took a single dose of cip- rofloxacin, the rest of her clinical history was not consistent with G6PD deficiency, and there was no mention of adverse side effects associ- ated with previous ciprofloxacin treatment. There was also no clinical history or laboratory evidence of an underlying rheumatologic condition, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or liver disease, which can result in hemolysis.\n\nThrombotic Microangiopathy\nHowever, the peripheral-blood smear showed the presence of schistocytes, which are red-cell fragments resulting from intravascular destruc- tion that can occur from mechanical trauma (e.g., mechanical heart valves, mechanical circu- latory support or ventricular assist devices, or dialysis) or nontraumatic causes (e.g., thrombotic microangiopathy). When thrombotic microangi- opathy is present, microthrombi in small vessels cause shearing of red cells, which results in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. However, the absence of thrombocytopenia and fever with acute kidney injury or a diarrheal illness (hemo- lytic\u2013uremic syndrome) or altered mental status (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) argues against thrombotic microangiopathy as a cause of this patient\u2019s hemolysis.\n\nMechanical Trauma\u2013Induced Hemolytic Anemia\nThe most likely cause of this patient\u2019s presenta- tion is mechanical trauma\u2013induced hemolytic anemia associated with prosthetic heart valves. Hemolytic anemia in the presence of a mechan- ical heart valve often occurs with paravalvular regurgitation or new heart failure symptoms. Except for the finding of elevated jugular venous pressure, this patient did not have evidence of heart failure, such as pulmonary edema or an elevated level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natri- uretic peptide. However, physical examination revealed a harsh systolic murmur at the apex, the location and quality of which are most con- sistent with regurgitation of the mitral valve. A transthoracic echocardiogram did not show evi- dence of other possible causes of a harsh sys- tolic murmur, such as a ventricular septal defect or left ventricular outflow obstruction. Left ven- tricular dimensions were normal on transtho- racic echocardiography, providing further evi- dence that a cardiac process was likely to be acute rather than chronic. The inferior vena cava was normal in size, indicating that clinically significant volume overload was not present.\nIn patients with a prosthetic heart valve, hemolysis can occur as a result of high shear stress with turbulent flow and can be precipitated by new foreign material, such as a loose suture, abnormal flow characteristics of the prosthetic valve (more common with a ball-and-cage valve than with the type of mechanical valve this pa- tient has), valve failure or degeneration, or a paravalvular leak.3 Transthoracic echocardiogra- phy is the initial cardiac imaging method of choice to evaluate abnormalities in mechanical heart valves. This patient\u2019s mechanical aortic valve was well seated and showed pressure gra- dients that were within the expected range for an aortic prosthesis with mild aortic regurgita- tion; if the regurgitation had been more severe, it would have resulted in a notable diastolic murmur, and there was no report of a diastolic murmur on physical examination. The mechani- cal mitral valve was also well seated, and the mean pressure gradient of 4 mm Hg indicated the absence of hemodynamically significant prosthetic mitral stenosis, a condition that can occur with prosthetic mitral-valve degeneration or pannus formation. Extensive calcification of the mitral annulus and the mitral subvalvular apparatus was present but did not affect the opening or closing of the mitral-valve disks on transthoracic echocardiography and was there- fore unlikely to contribute to this patient\u2019s clini- cal presentation. In addition, the normal open- ing and closing of the mitral-valve disks was not consistent with thrombus formation or degen- erative valve disease at the valve orifice.\nParavalvular Leak\nParavalvular leaks are the most common cause of hemolytic anemia among patients with a prosthetic valve; they are caused by an incomplete seal between the valve and the adjacent native cardiac tissue, resulting in abnormal retrograde blood flow around the circumference of the valve. The presence of annular calcification, as in this case, is a risk factor for paravalvular leaks. However, mitral regurgitation could not be adequately assessed on transthoracic echocardiography owing to acoustic shadowing. Because the clinical suspicion for mitral regurgitation (particularly due to a paravalvular leak) is high in the context of a severe systolic murmur at the apex and acute hemolytic anemia, transesophageal echocardiography is warranted. Furthermore, given the absence of clinically significant heart failure symptoms, it can be surmised that the paravalvular leak was likely to have been occur ring through a small orifice. Paravalvular leaks that occur through a relatively small orifice have been reported to be associated with larger pressure gradients between the left ventricle and left atrium, harsher heart murmurs, and more severe hemolysis than leaks occurring through larger orifices,4 and these findings are consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nDr. Ghoshhajra: Evaluation of the coronary artery was performed noninvasively with the use of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) to rule out the presence of coronary-artery stenosis, which would confer a perioperative risk, and to rule out potential high-risk coronary anatomy warrant- ing surgical revascularization if surgical man- agement was pursued. The scan did not show left main coronary artery disease or three-vessel coronary artery disease, but a moderate narrow- ing of the left anterior descending artery, which was ultimately deemed not hemodynamically significant (Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System [CAD-RADS] 3),5 was noted (Fig. 3A and 3B). CCTA can also show valvular anatomical features and can complement cardi- ac echocardiography, since it is not affected by acoustic windows, acoustic shadowing, or Dop- pler blooming artifacts; in the case of this pa- tient, the mechanical mitral-valve prosthesis was well depicted (Fig. 3C) and its function readily visualized (see Video 3). In particular, the CCTA showed the precise size of this patient\u2019s paraval- vular leaks in various planes (Fig. 3D and 3E). When applicable, it can help to assess the rela- tionship of the valvular annulus to adjacent coronary arteries and cardiac veins. In this patient, extensive bulky mitral annular calcifica- tions were also apparent (Fig. 3F).\n\nFigure 2. Transesophageal Echocardiogram.\nImages from live three\u2011dimensional transesophageal echocardiography show an en face view of the mitral prosthesis from the left atrial aspect. Panel A and Panel B (with color Doppler) show normal opening of the mechanical mitral\u2011 valve bileaflet tilting\u2011disk prosthesis during diastole (Panel A, arrow), allowing normal transvalvular flow across the mitral prosthesis (Panel B, arrow). Panel C and Panel D (with color Doppler) show normal closing of the mitral\u2011valve disks during systole (Panel C, arrow), preventing valvular regurgitation from within the valve frame (Panel D, orange arrow). Two foci of paravalvular regurgitation (Panel D, white arrows), located posterolaterally, are seen originating outside the valve frame during systole.\n\nFigure 3 (facing page). Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiogram.\nA curved planar reformatted image of the left main and left anterior descending coronary arteries (Panel A) shows a widely patent left main coronary artery and calcified stenosis of the middle left anterior descending artery (arrow). A curved planar reformatted image of the right coronary artery (Panel B) shows multifocal calcified stenoses without hemodynamically significant luminal narrowing. A multiplanar reformatted image in a \u201cpseudo\u201d four\u2011chamber view (Panel C) shows the paravalvular leak along the lateral aspect of the mitral prosthesis as continuity of contrast material between the left ventricle and left atrium (arrow). A short\u2011axis view in the plane of the mitral valve (Panel D) shows the site of paravalvu\u2011 lar regurgitation en face in the lateral position (arrow). Normal functioning of the valve prosthesis disks is ap\u2011 parent in a three\u2011chamber view during diastole (Panel E), with the mitral\u2011valve disks in an appropriate open position (arrow) and the aortic\u2011valve disks in an appro\u2011 priate closed position (asterisk). A thickened three\u2011di\u2011 mensional volume\u2011rendered image in a three\u2011chamber view during systole (Panel F) shows bulky mitral annu\u2011 lar calcifications (asterisk) adjacent to the valve; the mi\u2011 tral valve (arrow) is closed.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Namasivayam: Transesophageal echocardiog- raphy is the test of choice to assess a mechanical mitral-valve prosthesis, especially for evaluation of paravalvular leaks. Because the esophagus is located immediately posterior to the left atrium, imaging of the mitral valve is usually clear, since it is unaffected by acoustic reverberation or shadowing. Both two-dimensional and three- dimensional imaging can be performed.\nThis patient\u2019s transesophageal echocardiogram (Fig. 2 and Video 2) showed a mechanical mitral-\nvalve prosthesis with normal motion of the pros- thetic mitral-valve disks, no echocardiographically significant obstruction to inflow, no associated thrombus or mass, and no valvular regurgitation (from within the circumference of the valve ring, usually denoting a problem with motion of the mitral-valve disks of a mechanical prosthesis). Two foci of paravalvular regurgitation (from outside the frame of the valve ring, unrelated to mitral-valve disk motion in a mechanical prosthe- sis) were noted posterolaterally on two-dimen- sional and three-dimensional imaging. Extensive calcification of the mitral annulus and mitral subvalvular apparatus was again noted. In addi- tion, in an image obtained in the deep transgas- tric view (not shown), a small posteromedial paravalvular leak adjacent to the mechanical aortic-valve prosthesis was noted.\n\n",
