    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kevin L. Ard: A 63-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital in the spring be- cause of fever, confusion, headache, garbled speech, fatigue, vision changes, lym- phocytic pleocytosis, and an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nApproximately 5 years before the current presentation, the patient had received a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy at another hospital. Treatment with oral prednisone and cyclosporine was initiated.\nTwo years later, the patient was referred to the nephrology clinic of this hospi- tal for worsening proteinuria and hypertension; rituximab, prednisone, and cyclo- phosphamide were administered. During the next 21 months, he received four doses of rituximab, the last of which was administered 3 months before this presentation.\nThree months before this presentation, the patient had a flash of light accom- panied by transient sharp pain in the left retro-orbital area and forehead, with monocular blurry vision. He was subsequently evaluated at the other hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the head were normal. Intravenous normal saline was administered, and he was discharged. One week later, the patient was reevaluated at the same hospital for an episode of garbled and nonsensical speech with impaired comprehension that resolved after 10 minutes. A CT angiogram and an MRI of the head reportedly showed a sub- acute infarct in the right side of the pons; intravenous alteplase was administered. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was normal. Mild word-finding difficulties and confusion persisted.\nAfter discharge, the patient had worsening vision with floaters in the left eye, headache, photophobia, sonophobia, and fatigue. Three weeks later, he was evalu- ated by a neuro-ophthalmologist, who prescribed oral butalbital\u2013acetaminophen\u2013 caffeine therapy and ophthalmic prednisolone drops for suspected uveitis. The vision improved, and headaches decreased during the subsequent 2 weeks; however, 1 week later, he was readmitted to the other hospital with sudden onset of weakness on the right side, facial droop, and garbled speech. The weakness resolved after 10 minutes. CT and MRI of the head and TTE were reportedly un- changed from the previous imaging studies. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed focal left temporal slowing, and treatment with levetirace- tam was initiated. The garbled speech resolved after 2 days, and he was discharged from the hospital.\nDuring the next week, the patient had recurrent staring spells that lasted for 1 minute, during which his family thought he appeared \u201cvacant\u201d; low-grade fever also developed, and within 48 hours, the temperature increased to 39.4\u00b0C and the garbled speech recurred. He was readmitted to the other hospital, and CT of the head was again reportedly normal. Blood levels of cal- cium, albumin, globulin, ammonia, thyrotropin, lactate, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function tests and urinalysis. Tests for Lyme disease antibodies, hepatitis B vi- rus surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplas- mic antibodies (ANCA) were negative, and levels of complement were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A lumbar puncture was performed; tests for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and West Nile virus were nega- tive, and a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test of the CSF was nonreactive (Table 2). The patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nA review of systems provided by the patient\u2019s family was notable for somnolence, fatigue, generalized weakness, unsteadiness, headaches, staring spells, floaters in the left eye, photopho- bia, sonophobia, mild neck stiffness, uninten- tional weight loss of 10 kg in the past 6 months, and nocturia. The patient reported no muscle or joint pain, rash, eye pain, diplopia, oral lesions, cough, dyspnea, nausea, or abdominal pain. His medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, early-onset coronary artery disease for which he had received percutaneous coro- nary intervention in his 50s and for which he had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting in his 60s, congenital color blindness, colonic polyps, and prostatic hypertrophy. Medications included cyclophosphamide, levetiracetam, aspi- rin, pravastatin, metoprolol, losartan, hydrochloro- thiazide, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, ome- prazole, calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, ferrous sulfate, a multivitamin, and fluticasone. He had not taken other antibiotic agents or non- steroidal antiinflammatory drugs.\nThe patient was a retired government employee and lived with his wife in northern New England. He had recently traveled to Florida and to rural Canada and had spent time hunting. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for approximately 30 years but had quit 7 years be- fore the current presentation. He drank two beers per week and did not use illicit substances. His family history included coronary artery dis- ease in both parents and valvular disease in his mother, psoriatic arthritis in a sister, and sar- coidosis in several siblings; there was no history of renal or neurologic disease.\nThe temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the blood pressure 128/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.4. He appeared cachectic, with bitemporal wasting. He was somnolent and difficult to arouse with voice; he was oriented to self and intermittently to place, month, and year. His thoughts were perseverative. On mental-status examination, he was unable to name days of the week backward (he named a month and then named the days forward) and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations. Occasional word-finding difficul- ties were noted, although repetition, naming, and reading were generally intact. When asked to remember three words, he could recall only one word after 5 minutes. He reported that nine quarters equaled $4.25. His affect and speech were intact. The cranial-nerve examination re- vealed blurriness in the visual fields, \u201cdiscom- fort\u201d with eye movements, and limited upward gaze. There was no weakness or pronator drift; a low-amplitude intention tremor was present in the left hand. The muscle tone was increased in both legs, with diffuse hyperreflexia, pectoralis reflexes, and seven beats of ankle clonus. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, glycated hemoglobin, bilirubin, albumin, prealbumin, total protein, lactate dehydrogenase, high-density and low-density lipoprotein choles- terol, and thyrotropin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of liver-function tests; other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A compre- hensive urine toxicology screen was negative, and a serum toxicology screen was negative for acetaminophen, salicylates, ethanol, and tricyclic antidepressants. Screening tests for human im- munodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and Treponema pallidum were negative. Cultures of the blood and urine were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was normal. CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no hemorrhage, acute infarction, or mass lesion. Opacification of the right maxillary sinus was noted. MRI of the head (Fig. 1) and mag- netic resonance angiography of the head and neck revealed signal hyperintensity in the sulci on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with associated subtle enhancement on gadolinium- enhanced T1-weighted images; additional sub- arachnoid and subdural foci characterized by restricted diffusion with no enhancement; non- specific changes in the white matter; opacifica- tion of the right maxillary sinus; and no vascular abnormality. MRI of the spine revealed multi- level degenerative changes, without mass effect on the spinal cord, cord signal abnormality, or abnormal enhancement.\nDr. Ard: Intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone,  ampicillin, vancomycin, and thiamine were admin- istered. On the second hospital day, the tempera- ture was 37.6\u00b0C, and myoclonic jerks were noted; marked lethargy, photophobia, and nonsensical speech persisted. The patient was intermittently impulsive and uncooperative. The white-cell count was 17,960 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the blood levels of vitamin B12, angiotensin-converting enzyme, complement, and haptoglobin and CD4+ T-cell subset counts were normal. ANCA, antinuclear antibodies, cryptococcal antigen, cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, galactomannan, and\nB. burgdorferi antibodies were not detected in the blood. A lumbar puncture was performed; the opening pressure was 10 cm of water, and the CSF was yellow and slightly turbid. Addi- tional results of CSF analysis are shown in Ta- ble 2. CSF was obtained for culture, cytologic examination, and an autoimmune encephalopa- thy panel. An EEG showed intermittent periods of theta slowing in the bilateral posterior quad- rants, with no epileptiform discharges.\nOn examination by an ophthalmologist, bilat- eral visual acuity, visual fields, and intraocular pressure were normal, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed bilateral posterior vitreal detach- ment but no cells in the anterior or posterior chambers. Dilated-eye examination revealed ede- ma in both optic nerves, with tortuous vessels. There was no evidence of anterior uveitis, retini- tis, or retinal necrosis.\nOn the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, and the white-cell count was 8300 per microliter. The patient reported improved strength. Tests for bartonella antibodies and Tropheryma whipplei DNA were negative. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a diffuse decrease in gamma globulin, with an IgG level of 378 mg per deciliter (reference range, 614 to 1295), an IgA level of 30 mg per deciliter (reference range, 69 to 309), and an IgM level of 7 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334); the serum free light chain levels and the results of immunoelectro- phoresis were normal. A CSF VDRL test was nonreactive, and CSF testing was negative for cryptococcal antigen, eastern equine encephalitis antibodies, enterovirus RNA, West Nile virus RNA, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 DNA, and varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV) DNA.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the patient reported feeling better and having increased strength, which allowed him to walk. Blood tests for cryoglobulin, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, and thy- roid peroxidase antibodies were negative.\nOn the fifth hospital day, the patient was calm and cooperative; oriented to person, place, and time; and able to follow complex com- mands. CSF tests for listeria antibodies, Epstein\u2013 Barr virus DNA, and human herpesvirus 6 DNA were negative, as were blood and urine tests for histoplasma antigens. A whole-body positron- emission tomographic (PET)\u2013CT scan did not show f luorodeoxyglucose avidity. The results of a repeat lumbar puncture are shown in Table 2.\nA repeat ophthalmologic examination revealed the presence of vitreous cells, which were more numerous in the left eye than in the right eye; persistent edema in the left optic nerve; and an increase in the blind spot of the left eye on Humphrey visual-field testing. A f luorescein angiogram showed no evidence of ocular vas- culitis.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Shibani S. Mukerji: This 63-year-old man, who had a history of primary membranous nephrop- athy and had received rituximab, began to have painful retro-orbital visual impairment, subacute progressive encephalopathy, and gait distur- bances. Three months after the onset of symp- toms, CSF evaluation was notable for lympho- cytic pleocytosis without hypoglycorrhachia. His hospital course was also notable for the pres- ence of vitreous cells in both eyes on the second ocular examination. Administration of broad- spectrum antimicrobial agents resulted in rapid improvement in his clinical condition within days despite increasing neurologic symptoms over the course of several months, findings that suggested meningoencephalitis. Despite an exten- sive evaluation for likely causes of meningoen- cephalitis, a definitive diagnosis was not estab- lished. This patient\u2019s presentation and clinical course are emblematic of challenges faced by clinicians, given that the causative agent in me- ningoencephalitis is identified in only 30 to 60% of cases, despite extensive and invasive testing.1,2 To frame this discussion, I will focus on three salient clinical features of this patient\u2019s presen- tation as I consider various diagnoses in this case: uveitis associated with meningoencephalitis, sub- acute cognitive decline, and clinical improve- ment after the administration of antimicrobial\ntherapy.\n\nNoninfectious  Immune-Mediated  Conditions Given this patient\u2019s history of autoimmune glo- merular disease, it is reasonable to consider a noninfectious immune-mediated neurologic dis- order as a possible diagnosis. However, the rela- tively prolonged course of his symptoms and the rapid improvement after the administration of antimicrobial therapy make such a diagnosis\nunlikely. Central nervous system (CNS) vasculi- tis, either primary (isolated angiitis of the CNS) or as part of systemic illness, can cause subacute dementia with headache. The clinical course of isolated angiitis of the CNS can be one of relaps- ing events, elevated leukocyte counts (typically lymphocytes) with elevated protein levels, and subacute clinical dementia.3 Other systemic dis- eases, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, should also be considered in this case. Tests for\n \nANCA and for rheumatologic disorders were\nnegative, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and complement level were normal. It is also notable that this patient had received rituximab and cyclophosphamide \u2014 medications common- ly used in the treatment of noninfectious vascu- litic conditions affecting the CNS \u2014 yet still had clinical progression. Many such conditions are associated with angiographic changes in the intracranial blood vessels and parenchymal ab- normalities that can be seen on MRI of the head. Although a small pontine infarct and sulcal hyper- intensities were observed, there were no menin- geal or parenchymal enhancing lesions, other subcortical ischemic infarcts, or blood vessel abnormalities that would suggest an underlying vasculitis.\n\nCNS Lymphoma\nThe patient\u2019s progressive decline, fevers, and un- intentional weight loss could suggest cancer, and extensive diagnostic testing was performed, including whole-body PET-CT. Primary CNS lym- phoma is a rare form of extranodal non-Hodg- kin\u2019s lymphoma that is often confined to the brain, spinal cord, and eyes, without evidence of systemic disease. In addition to headaches and behavioral changes, patients with CNS lymphoma typically have enhancing brain lesions, lepto- meningeal enhancement, or other abnormalities on MRI. In contrast, patients with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma can have nondescript, insidious symptoms, without abnormalities on imaging of the head. Both types of lymphoma are treated with chemotherapy and would not result in rapid amelioration after treatment with antibiotics.\nInfection\nThe most likely cause of this patient\u2019s meningo- encephalitis is an infectious agent, not only be- cause of the inflammatory nature of the CSF but also given the improvement in his clinical condi- tion after antimicrobial therapy. Many common pathogens that are associated with uveitis and meningoencephalitis were considered, and test- ing for these pathogens was performed as part of this patient\u2019s evaluation. However, a unique feature of this patient\u2019s presentation is his expo- sure to rituximab, a humanized chimeric anti- CD20 monoclonal antibody that causes B-cell depletion. The effects of rituximab should be considered when interpreting the results of IgG and IgM serologic tests. This concern is relevant to testing for West Nile virus infection and east- ern equine encephalitis, both of which can cause neuroinvasive viral encephalitis and are endemic in the northeastern United States. The antibody response during these infections can be delayed or absent in patients with B-cell depletion.4,5 Such a response may also occur in Powassan virus infection, an emerging cause of viral me- ningoencephalitis in the United States that is transmitted by ticks.6 In this case, CSF antibody and RNA testing for West Nile virus and CSF testing for eastern equine encephalitis antibod- ies were negative. Given that West Nile virus infection, eastern equine encephalitis, and Pow- assan virus infection typically result in a rapidly progressive meningoencephalitis, are associated with high complication rates, and would not abate with antiviral therapy, these conditions are unlikely causes of this patient\u2019s illness.\nA key question remains: What pathogen can\ncause uveitis and meningoencephalitis and result in rapid clinical improvement after the adminis- tration of vancomycin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir? I ruled out fungi, parasites, and amoebas as possible causative agents, because they typically produce lesions that are visible on radiography, are associated with high rates of death and complications, and do not resolve without appropriate therapy.\nAmong the treatable infectious agents that can cause uveitis and meningoencephalitis, HSV, VZV, and CMV contribute to the worldwide bur- den of eye-related diseases. Infection with HSV is the most common cause of sporadic viral en- cephalitis, and changes in the brain that are visible on MRI are noted within days of neuro- logic decline. The sensitivity of HSV-specific nu- cleic acid testing to diagnose HSV-related menin- goencephalitis is greater than 90%; the negative test in this patient makes this diagnosis unlikely. VZV infection has been associated with indolent encephalitis in immunosuppressed hosts, and a rash is not always present (zoster sine herpete). In contrast to HSV-1\u2013 and HSV-2\u2013specific nucle- ic acid tests, CSF nucleic acid testing for VZV has a sensitivity of only 60% (at best) to diagnose meningoencephalitis. VZV serologic testing can aid in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and vas- culopathy; however, ocular infections due to her-\n \n\npes viruses typically result in panuveitis, and intra- ocular findings include necrosis of the retina and retinal periarteritis. Immunocompromised hosts may present with relatively reduced ocular inflammation, but necrotizing retinal lesions would still be expected to be present. This pa- tient underwent multiple ophthalmologic exami- nations, including fluorescence angiography, with no evidence of a retinal pathologic condition, which suggests that a herpes virus is unlikely to be a cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms, and there- fore treatment with acyclovir is unlikely to ex- plain his clinical improvement.\nThis patient\u2019s ocular inflammation was con-\nfined to the vitreous, which suggests an inter- mediate uveitis, and he had optic-nerve edema. Infectious causes of intermediate uveitis include tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria and Whipple\u2019s disease caused by T. whipplei. This patient had no epidemiologic or clinical clues\n\u2014\tsuch as disturbances of ocular movement or movement disorders, or absence of granuloma- tous disease in the CNS or other organs \u2014 sug- gestive of these diagnoses. In addition, the anti- microbial agents administered in this case would not be adequate to treat a CNS mycobacterial infection.\nSpirochete infections can cause uveitis and meningoencephalitis, and many organisms in this phylum, such as T. pallidum, leptospira, and several borrelia species, can cause pathogenic disease in humans. Syphilis can affect any por- tion of the eye; it can cause uveitis, which typically involves the anterior chamber, or panuveitis. Other manifestations of syphilis include chorioretinitis, optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis, and interstitial keratitis, and if untreated, it can re- sult in ocular hypertension and vision loss. The incidence of syphilis in the United States has increased in recent years, and delay in diagnosis has been associated with an increased risk of complications.7 In this patient, the T. pallidum antibody screen and CSF VDRL tests were nega- tive on multiple occasions; given his immunosuppressed status, one may have anticipated more marked ocular pathologic findings if the patient had syphilis that had been untreated for 3 months.\nLeptospirosis is an unlikely diagnosis. Shortterm ocular findings associated with leptospiro- sis typically include nonspecific conjunctivitis, and chronic phases of the disease can include anterior uveitis and neuroretinitis. In the later chronic phase involving encephalitis, changes in the brain are visible on MRI; however, no such changes are present in this patient, and there is no reported history of travel to areas in which leptospira are endemic.\nIn more rare instances, B. burgdorferi \u2014 the causative agent for Lyme disease \u2014 can cause uveitis and optic neuropathy.8 This patient lives in a region of the country where tickborne dis- eases are endemic, and he is an avid hunter. Given that his condition improved dramatically after the administration of antibiotics, specifi- cally ceftriaxone, infection with borrelia species is a seemingly logical diagnosis for this patient. Testing for Lyme disease occurs as a part of a two-tiered algorithm and measures a person\u2019s antibody response to the spirochete. Whether treatment with rituximab delays formation of antibodies in blood and CSF is unknown, thus complicating the interpretation of this patient\u2019s serologic test results. In published cases of patients with clinically suspected B. burgdorferi infection who had neurologic complications con- sistent with Lyme disease in the context of immu- nosuppression, abnormal findings were observed on imaging of the head or spine. These included enhancement of the meninges, the presence of plaquelike subcortical white-matter disease, and in some patients, enhancement of cranial or spinal nerve roots.9 The absence of radiographic abnor- malities of the CNS in this patient, despite a sub- acute cognitive decline with ataxia, and repeatedly negative serologic tests make B. burgdorferi unlikely.\n\nB. miyamotoi\nThere is another borrelia species that can be transmitted by the ixodes tick, and infection causes a symptom complex that is remarkably consistent with this patient\u2019s clinical presentation. In two case reports of meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients receiving ritux- imab, B. miyamotoi was the causative agent.10,11 The patients described in the published reports were 70 and 80 years of age, had received ritux- imab for hematologic cancers, and presented with weight loss, subacute cognitive decline, gait disturbances, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and an elevated total protein level in the CSF. Both pa- tients recovered after the administration of in travenous antibiotics. A detailed description of MRI of the head was not published for either patient, but the findings of both were reportedly normal. In both patients, Wright\u2013Giemsa stain- ing of CSF showed spirochetes, and a definitive diagnosis of B. miyamotoi infection was made on the basis of nucleic acid testing of the blood.\nAdditional features of this patient\u2019s presenta- tion that support a diagnosis of B. miyamotoi in- fection include recurrent fever and the lack of an associated rash. The features that do not fit well with this diagnosis are the patient\u2019s vision symp- toms and ophthalmologic findings. To my knowl- edge, there are no reports of B. miyamotoi causing eye disease, but given our limited understanding of this infection and the fact that other spiro- chetes can cause uveitis and edema in the optic- nerve head, I suspect that B. miyamotoi is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. To establish this diagnosis, I would perform nucleic acid testing of the CSF for B. miyamotoi DNA while continuing treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone.\n",
