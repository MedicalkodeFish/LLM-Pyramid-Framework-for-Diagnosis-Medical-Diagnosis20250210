    "Primary Symptom": "A 49-Year-Old Man with Hypoglycemia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Mollie Sands (Medicine): A 49-year-old man was admitted to this hospital be-  cause of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been well until 3 hours before this admission, when altered mental status developed while he was at work. During a meeting, his colleagues noticed that he was not paying attention or participating in the conversation, which was atypical of the patient. Instead, he was fidgeting and mumbling as though talking to another person. When his mobile telephone rang, he allowed it  to continue ringing.\nTwo hours before this admission, the patient was found by colleagues on the floor of a conference room. His eyes were open, but he was obtunded and making nonpurposeful movements. Emergency medical services were called. On evalua- tion, a fingerstick glucose measurement was 39 mg per deciliter (2.2 mmol per  liter; reference range, 70 to 109 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). Intra- venous dextrose was administered, and the patient was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient was obtunded and did not react to sternal rub. Additional intravenous dextrose was administered, and a dex- trose infusion was started. The patient\u2019s mental status improved, and he was able to provide additional history. That morning, he had felt that he was in a \u201cdream- like\u201d state; there were no other symptoms. The altered mental status had resolved, but he could not recall most events of the morning, including the meeting that had taken place 3 hours before admission.\nReview of symptoms was notable for unintentional weight gain of one pant size during the past 3 months, as well as intermittent morning dizziness during the past 3 years, which would resolve after the patient ate candy or breakfast. He re- ported no recent illness, depression, anxiety, change in activity or exercise, or change in intake of food or drink. On a typical day, he had breakfast at 5 a.m., a second breakfast at 10 a.m., lunch at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and a snack at 8 p.m. The patient had last eaten approximately 7 hours before presentation to the emergency department.\nTwo years earlier, the patient had had an epi- sode of drooping and decreased sensation of the left side of the face and difficulty enunciating words, which occurred while he was at work. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The blood glucose level was 64 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter), and testing for Lyme disease was negative. He received a diag- nosis of Bell\u2019s palsy and was treated with pred- nisone and acyclovir; the symptoms resolved. Two months later, the patient established care in the primary care clinic of this hospital. Routine laboratory testing revealed a blood glucose level of 46 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter).\nThe patient took vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements. He took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He drank alcohol\nrarely and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Sixteen years earlier, he had immigrated to the United States from Southeast Asia and now lived alone in an urban area of New England. He worked as a registered nurse. His father and brother had type 2 diabetes and used insulin.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 146/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.6. The patient appeared well. He had no hepatosplenomegaly or skin hyperpigmentation, and the remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the blood glucose level was 36 mg per  deciliter  (2.0 mmol per liter); after the administration of dextrose, a fingerstick glucose measurement  was 158 mg per deciliter (8.8 mmol per liter).  The complete blood count and blood electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver- function and kidney-function tests. The glycated hemoglobin level was 5.4% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Amy W. Baughman: This 49-year-old man pre- sented with recurrent symptomatic hypoglyce- mia. He reported that he had gained weight re- cently, that he was eating five meals a day, and that he had intermittent morning dizziness that resolved with food. His medical history included Bell\u2019s palsy and hypoglycemia that had not been evaluated previously. His social history was notable for his job as a nurse in a medical facility and his family history of diabetes. Initial labora- tory testing revealed a normal glycated hemoglo- bin level and a low glucose level (36 mg per deciliter).\nIn developing a differential diagnosis, the most specific feature of this patient\u2019s presenta- tion is symptomatic hypoglycemia. He presented with Whipple\u2019s triad, a sign that was first de- scribed in the 1930s by Dr. Allen Whipple, who aimed to establish criteria for pancreatic surgery for insulinomas.1 Whipple\u2019s triad includes symp- toms of hypoglycemia, which often occur in a fasting state or after exercise; a low plasma glu- cose level; and resolution of the symptoms with the administration of glucose. Today, this sign is useful for identifying persons who should un- dergo a formal evaluation for hypoglycemia.\nIn constructing a differential diagnosis to determine the cause of hypoglycemia, there are three broad categories to consider: systemic ill- ness, ingestion of drugs or toxins, and endoge- nous insulin production.\n\nSystemic Illness\nHypoglycemia is a common problem in hospital- ized patients, both those who have diabetes mel- litus and those who do not; it can be seen with several systemic disease processes.2 Hypoglyce- mia can occur in patients with sepsis or a condi- tion that causes a malnourished state, such as anorexia nervosa. It can also be seen in patients with liver failure, kidney failure, congestive heart failure, hormonal deficiency (e.g., adrenal insuf- ficiency), or disorders of carbohydrate metabo- lism. Normally, the body has several regulatory mechanisms that prevent hypoglycemia, includ- ing hormonal and neural signaling pathways that ensure glucose availability from intake, he- patic and renal gluconeogenesis, and hepatic glycogenolysis. However, in the context of sys- temic diseases, some of the pathways may be dysfunctional or impaired to such an extent that the normal compensatory processes are over- whelmed and hypoglycemia occurs.\nA much less common systemic illness that\ncan cause hypoglycemia is cancer complicated by non\u2013islet-cell tumor hypoglycemia. This para- neoplastic syndrome results in overproduction of insulin-like growth factor II, which stimulates the insulin receptor.3 Patients with this compli- cation usually present with large, clinically ob- vious tumors,4 such as mesenchymal tumors, fibromas, adenocarcinomas, or hepatocellular carcinomas.3\nIn this case, these causes of hypoglycemia are unlikely because the patient was generally well\n \n\nand did not have evidence of a systemic illness, kidney or liver disease, or cancer. In addition, the fact that he had persistent hypoglycemia, despite having functional compensatory mecha- nisms such as hepatic gluconeogenesis, suggests an alternative mechanism, specifically medica- tion or hyperinsulinism.\n\nIngestion of Drugs or Toxins\nHypoglycemia can be due to ingestion of drugs or toxins. Heavy alcohol use may result in hypo- glycemia in persons who have poor nutritional status or impaired liver function due to hepatic glycogen depletion.5,6 This patient reported that he drank alcohol rarely, and he had an ethanol level of 0 mg per deciliter on admission; also, he did not have evidence of nutritional deficiencies or liver disease.\nAside from diabetes medications, several drugs have been associated with hypoglycemia, although in a systematic review of 164 drugs,  the quality of evidence supporting the associa- tion was only low to moderate.7 Medications that are commonly implicated as causes of hypogly- cemia include fluoroquinolones, quinine, beta- blockers, and angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors. Hypoglycemia has also been reported after ingestion of herbal products that are con- taminated  with  sulfonylureas  and   glyburide.8,9\nThis patient was taking vitamin B12 and vitamin D supplements, but he did not report using any other medications or herbal supplements, and\nthe chronic nature of his hypoglycemic symp- toms suggests that medications are not the  cause of his hypoglycemia.\nMedications  that  are  used  to  treat diabetes\n\u2014 insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides \u2014 can cause hypoglycemia. Accidental hypoglycemia occurs when a patient unintentionally takes a diabetes medication, or someone unintentionally admin- isters a diabetes medication to the patient, be- cause of a medication mix-up or contamination. In contrast, factitious hypoglycemia occurs when a patient intentionally or surreptitiously takes a diabetes medication to induce low blood sugar. A person with an episode of factitious hypogly- cemia may have diabetes, may be in close con- tact with someone who has diabetes, or may be a medical professional. The person may also have an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, or have a history of suicidality10; in one case report, 2 out of 10 patients with an episode of factitious hypoglycemia went on to commit suicide.11 Finally, malicious hypoglyce- mia occurs when someone intentionally admin- isters a diabetes medication to the patient to induce low blood sugar, which can be seen in cases of Munchausen\u2019s syndrome by proxy.12 Ac- cidental, factitious, and malicious hypoglycemia often occur at random times, with no relation to a fasting state or meals.\nOf note, this patient probably had access to diabetes medications because he had family members with diabetes and was a nurse, but he did not have a history of mental illness or de- pression. In addition, his episodes of hypoglyce- mia were not random; they were induced by a fasting state.\n\nEndogenous Hyperinsulinism\nCauses of endogenous insulin production in- clude noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypogly- cemia syndrome (NIPHS), insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, and insulinomas. NIPHS is char- acterized by the presence of islet cells with ab- normal morphologic features, including hyper- trophy and nesidioblastosis, in the absence of an islet-cell tumor.13 NIPHS is less common than insulinomas, and it is associated with hypogly- cemia that occurs 2 to 4 hours postprandially, whereas hypoglycemia occurred in a fasting state in this patient.13\nInsulin autoimmune hypoglycemia is caused by antibodies that target insulin or the insulin receptor. One form of insulin autoimmune hypo- glycemia is Hirata\u2019s disease (insulin autoim- mune syndrome), which occurs when autoanti- bodies against endogenous insulin develop. Patients with Hirata\u2019s disease can present with hypoglycemic episodes that range in severity, although episodes are usually mild and post- prandial.14 The syndrome is often triggered by exposure to medications such as thiol com- pounds15 or by viruses,16 and it can be associated with autoimmune diseases or hematologic dis- orders.17 Hirata\u2019s disease was first described in Japan and is the third most common cause of hypoglycemia there.15 However, the disease is rare globally, with only 380 cases reported world- wide from 1970 to 2009.19\nAn even more rare form of insulin autoim-\nmune hypoglycemia is type B insulin resistance syndrome,  which  occurs  when  autoantibodies\n \nagainst the insulin receptor develop. Only 67 cases of type B insulin resistance syndrome have been reported worldwide as of 2014.20 Patients with type B insulin resistance syndrome most often present with severe diabetes and extreme insulin resistance, but they can also present with hypoglycemia.18 At low concentrations, anti\u2013 insulin receptor antibodies can cause hypoglyce- mia, with an effect similar to that of insulin; at higher concentrations, these antibodies can cause insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.20,21 Type B insulin resistance syndrome is also strongly associated with autoimmune diseases. This patient did not have diabetes mellitus or evidence of other autoimmune or hematologic disorders, so both Hirata\u2019s disease and type B insulin resistance syndrome are unlikely.\nInsulinomas are insulin-producing tumors\nthat arise from the beta cells of the pancreas. Up to 6% of insulinomas are associated with mul- tiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), an au- tosomal dominant disorder characterized by the presence of two or more tumors of the parathy- roid gland, pituitary gland, or pancreatic islet cells.22 Nearly all patients with insulinomas present with hypoglycemic symptoms, which can be progressive and are often provoked by a fasting state; these symptoms rarely occur in a postprandial state.23 One case report showed  that 77% of patients had autonomic symptoms and 96% had neuroglycopenic symptoms.23 This patient reported a history of intermittent morn- ing dizziness that resolved with food; on the morning of his current presentation with hypo- glycemia, he was found obtunded on the floor at work, having last eaten 7 hours before presenta- tion. In addition, weight gain is seen in 18 to 56% of patients with insulinomas,23,24 and this patient reported recent unintentional weight gain, which was potentially due to a tendency to eat frequent meals to avoid symptoms of hypo- glycemia.\nIn a case series that included 237 patients with\ninsulinomas, 43% of the patients were men, the median age at presentation was 50 years, and  the median duration of symptoms before diag- nosis was 1.5 years.22 This patient was a 49-year- old man in whom hypoglycemia had been identi- fied during routine laboratory evaluation 2 years earlier and symptoms of hypoglycemia had been occurring for at least 3 years.\nThe patient\u2019s age, presentation, clinical history, and duration of symptoms are most consis- tent with a diagnosis of insulinoma. To establish this diagnosis, I would initiate a supervised fast to monitor for symptomatic hypoglycemia. In ad- dition, I would measure serum levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and \u03b2-hydroxy- butyrate.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Nancy J. Wei: A supervised fast was performed to monitor for spontaneous symptomatic hypo- glycemic episodes. During the fast, the patient consumed only water. Every 2 hours, a point-of- care fingerstick glucose measurement was ob- tained, and a clinical assessment for subjective symptoms of hypoglycemia and for objective evi- dence of altered mental status was performed.25 At 4 hours, the fingerstick glucose measurement was 53 mg per deciliter (2.9 mmol per liter), and there were no symptoms of hypoglycemia or signs of altered mental status. Blood samples were obtained to measure serum levels of glucose (in a tube containing glycolytic agent), insu- lin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and \u03b2-hydroxybuty- rate. The supervised fast was continued, with a plan to obtain another fingerstick glucose mea- surement in 30 minutes.\nAt 4.5 hours, the fingerstick glucose mea- surement was 45 mg per deciliter (2.5 mmol per liter), and there were no symptoms of hypogly- cemia or signs of altered mental status. Blood samples were obtained to measure serum levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and a screen for oral hypo- glycemic agents was performed. The supervised fast was concluded, and dextrose was administered. The results of the fasting study showed endogenous hyperinsulinism that was consistent with insulinoma (Table 2). Localization studies, including computed tomography (CT) and endo- scopic ultrasonography, were performed.\nDr. Peter F. Hahn: Because the hypoglycemia was suggestive of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tu- mor, multidetector-row helical CT of the abdo- men was performed in two phases of contrast enhancement. Images obtained during the late arterial phase showed a 7-mm focus of enhance- ment in the pancreatic head, immediately adja- cent to a gas bubble in a periampullary duodenal diverticulum (Fig. 1A). This finding was not visible on images obtained during the standard portal venous phase, approximately 25 seconds later (Fig. 1B).\nContrast-enhanced arterial-phase images may be the only opportunity to detect functional neuroendocrine tumors, which are usually small and enhance transiently. The reported success of CT for localization of these tumors ranges widely,  with  63  to  82%  sensitivity  and  83   to\n100% specificity.26 A 2009 consensus statement\nestimated 73% sensitivity and 96% specificity.27 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often used instead of, or in addition to, CT for local- ization of suspected pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. MRI is more susceptible than CT to degradation by patient motion, with the image quality relying on the patient\u2019s ability to remain still. However, MRI offers advantages over CT. T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images can show hyperintensity of pancreatic  neuroendo- crine tumors, as compared with normal pancre- atic tissue. In addition, recent advances allow multiple image sets to be obtained during the arterial phase of enhancement; high temporal resolution increases the likelihood that the brief blush of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor will be captured. MRI also helps to distinguish rare cystic neuroendocrine tumors from branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. For lesions in the pancreatic tail, MRI can identify intrapancreatic splenules that can mimic pan- creatic  neuroendocrine  tumors.  MRI  was  not\nperformed in this case.\nAlso not performed in this case was hybrid positron-emission tomography (PET) and CT (PET-CT), or the more recently introduced PET and MRI (PET-MRI), with a gallium-68\u2013labeled somatostatin analogue nuclear pharmaceutical. These techniques can be used for localization of insulinomas, but they are usually used to detect metastases from malignant neuroendocrine tu- mors with sufficient differentiation to have so- matostatin receptors.28\nFigure 1. CT Scan of the Abdomen.\nAn image obtained during the late arterial phase of contrast enhancement (Panel A) shows a 7\u2011mm focus of enhancement (arrows) in the pancreatic head, adja\u2011 cent to a gas bubble in a periampullary duodenal diver\u2011 ticulum. An image obtained during the portal venous phase of contrast enhancement (Panel B), approxi\u2011 mately 25 seconds later, does not show the lesion.\nDr. Brenna W. Casey: After the lesion was localized on abdominal imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography was performed with the use of a linear array echoendoscope. Endoscopic ultrasonography suc- cessfully identifies up to 92% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that are as small as 3 to 5 mm in diameter. In this case, endoscopic ultra- sonography revealed a hypoechoic mass in the pancreatic  head  (Fig.  2).  The  mass measured\n11 mm by 10 mm in maximal cross-sectional diameter. The endosonographic borders were well defined. After confirming the absence of inter- vening vascular structures on color Doppler imag- ing, we performed a fine-needle biopsy to obtain a visible core of tissue. Rapid cytologic examina- tion of the specimen revealed malignant cells that were suggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor. On the basis  of  these findings, the   patient  was  referred for surgical resection and underwent successful enucleation of the head of the pancreas 15 days after the initial presentation.\n",
