    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Adam Tanious (Surgery): A 37-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of abdominal pain and aortic dilatation.\nThe patient had been well until 3 weeks before the current admission, when she began to have pain in the right side of the abdomen that radiated to the back. She also had nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Approximately 2 weeks before the current admission, she sought evaluation at the emergency department of another hospital. Physical examination was notable for pain with palpation of all four quadrants. The pulses were normal, and the blood pressure did not differ substan- tially between the two arms or between the two legs. The white-cell count was 9800 per microliter (reference range at the other hospital, 4800 to 10,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 41 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 44.0 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 10.0). Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood specimens were obtained for two sets of bacterial cultures, with each set consisting of an aerobic bottle and an anaerobic bottle.\nDr. Patrick D. Sutphin: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis,\nperformed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed soft-tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta and mild-to-moder- ate associated periaortic fat stranding (Fig. 1A and 1B). These findings prompted CT angiography, performed 1 hour later, which more clearly delineated infrarenal abdominal aortic wall thickening at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm (Fig. 1C).\nDr. Tanious: The patient was discharged from the emergency department of the other hospital on the same day, with a referral to the rheumatology clinic of that hospital and instructions to start treatment with prednisone. One day after dis- charge, one of the four culture bottles grew gram-positive bacilli, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital for investigation. After an evaluation, the positive culture was presumed to be contaminated. Additional blood specimens were obtained for culture, and the patient was discharged home on the second hospital day.\nThe fever and chills resolved, and the abdomi- nal pain abated initially but then gradually wors- ened. Eight days after discharge and 3 days be- fore the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 50 beats per minute, and the blood pressure  146/78  mm  Hg.  Physical  examination was notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness, which was worse with deep palpation in all four quadrants. The white-cell count was 32,800 per microliter, the platelet count 565,000 per micro- liter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level 110.0 mg per liter.\nThe urinalysis was normal; urine toxicologic screening was positive for amphetamines, canna- binoids, and opiates. Other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Sutphin: CT angiography revealed progres- sion of aortic wall thickening and periaortic fat stranding and interval narrowing of the proximal segment of the inferior mesenteric artery, with an increase in the aortic diameter to 3.1 cm.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was admitted to the other hospital for a second time. Intravenous f luids, methylprednisolone, and heparin were administered, as was empirical treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the next 3 days, the patient remained afebrile.\nConsultations with the rheumatology, infectious diseases, and vascular surgery departments were requested.\nDr. Sutphin: On the second hospital day, mag- netic resonance angiography of the abdomen revealed an increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter,\n3.6 cm) with enhancement of the aortic wall. On the fourth hospital day, CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a further increase in aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta (aortic diameter, 3.9 cm) with increasing luminal irregularity and periaortic fat stranding.\nDr. Tanious: The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional treatment. On evaluation, she reported abdominal pain that was worst in the right upper quadrant and radiated to the right lower quadrant, back, and chest. She rated the pain as 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 in- dicating the most severe pain. She also reported nausea but had not had fevers or chills since before the initial presentation. A review of systems was notable for the absence of fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, myalgias, joint  pain, and rash; blue fingertips occurred with exposure to cold.\nDr. Sutphin: CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed evidence of continued aneu- rysmal enlargement and increased luminal ir- regularity (Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F).\nDr. Tanious: The patient had a history of poly- cystic ovary syndrome, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity dis- order, asthma, and Chiari I malformation, which had led to suboccipital craniectomy 3 years ear- lier. She had undergone cesarean section 5 years earlier. Medications included prednisone, cloni- dine, promethazine, dicyclomine, and inhaled albuterol; latex had caused a rash. The patient was White, lived in an urban area of New England, and had recently been homeless. She had injected heroin for the past 5 years; her last injection had been 3 weeks earlier. She had a history of mari- juana use and reported no methamphetamine use. Sexual history was not obtained. She drank four alcoholic beverages and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily. Her sister had rheumatoid arthritis, her grandmother had tuberculosis, and several family members had hypermobility of the joints.\nOn examination, the patient was uncomfort- able because of the abdominal pain. The abdo- men was soft, with diffuse tenderness that was worst in the right upper quadrant and both lower quadrants. She did not have any ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, or warmth, redness, or swelling of the joints; the elbows and metacar- pophalangeal joints were hyperextensible. The white-cell count was 27,710 per microliter (refer- ence range at this hospital, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 576,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), the erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate 57 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the C-reactive protein level 60.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8.0). Testing for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Serologic testing for hepatitis C virus was positive. The blood-culture isolate detected at the other hospital was identified as bacillus species, and all other blood cultures performed at the other hospital showed no growth. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

Imaging Studies.\nAt the other hospital, CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Axial and sagittal images (Panels A and B, respectively) show soft\u2011tissue density adjacent to the infrarenal abdominal aorta (arrows) and associ\u2011 ated periaortic fat stranding. CT angiography was per\u2011 formed 1 hour later. The angiogram (Panel C) more clearly delineates aortic wall thickening (arrows) at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (asterisk), with an aortic diameter of 2.3 cm. At this hospital, CT angi\u2011 ography was performed 12 days after the initial study.\nThe angiogram (Panel D) shows an increase in the aortic diameter to 4.2 cm at the level of the inferior mesenteric artery (asterisk), with associated aortic wall thickening (arrows) and increasing luminal irregularity (arrowhead) in the distal abdominal aorta and left common iliac ar\u2011 tery. Three\u2011dimensional volume renderings of the initial CT angiogram (Panel E) and the CT angiogram obtained at this hospital (Panel F) are provided. As compared with the initial study, the later study shows the development of multifocal luminal irregularity (Panel F, arrowheads) and interval narrowing of the inferior mesenteric artery (Panels E and F, asterisks).\n\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Anahita Dua: I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the final diagnosis. This 37-year-old woman, who had a history of recent injection-drug use, presented with a 3-week history of abdominal pain and radiologic evi- dence of an enlarging infrarenal aortic aneurysm, characterized by aortic wall thickening and peri- aortic fat stranding. These findings are consis- tent with a preliminary diagnosis of infectious aortitis or large-vessel vasculitis.\n\nInfectious Aortitis\nCould this patient have a mycotic aneurysm due to infectious aortitis? Mycotic aneurysms, which are most frequently caused by degeneration of the aortic wall by staphylococcus or salmonella, account for less than 1% of aortic aneurysms. They typically occur in men older than 50 years of age who have coexisting conditions, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, congenital vascular abnormalities, or a history of trauma to the aorta.1,2 Mycotic aneurysms are often associated with aortic involvement and rapid degeneration, fea- tures seen in this case; however, several other features of this case are atypical of mycotic an- eurysms (Table 2).3,4\nThe mechanistic basis for mycotic aneurysms is thought to be infiltration of neutrophils and subsequent activation of lytic enzymes, which results in the distinctive saccular appearance of the aneurysm noted nearly universally in patients with this condition.2 The aneurysm identified in this patient did not have a saccular appearance; instead, it expanded circumferentially, dilating the aorta radially.\nMycotic aneurysms are infrequently caused by primary infection of the aorta. Infection of the aorta typically requires both inoculation by an offending pathogen and the presence of an un- derlying vascular abnormality or graft material. This is probably the reason that infectious aorti- tis is a rare diagnosis in persons younger than 50 years of age. Septic emboli involving periph- eral vessels are not uncommon, occurring in ap- proximately 10% of patients with endocarditis5; however, aortitis is an extremely rare complica- tion of this condition. Moreover, this patient had no evidence of valvular vegetations on transtho- racic echocardiography performed later during the hospitalization and no other evidence of emboli on imaging studies or physical exami- nation.\nExcept for recent injection-drug use, the pa- tient had no epidemiologic risk factors or clini- cal findings that would support a diagnosis of infectious aortitis. Syphilitic aortitis should be considered, although more than 90% of cases involve the ascending aorta.6 The white-cell count was less than 10,000 per microliter on the initial presentation to the other hospital, although it increased to 32,800 per microliter after gluco- corticoid treatment was started and then prompt- ly normalized after glucocorticoid treatment was discontinued (Table 1). The patient had no re- corded fevers (temperatures >38.6\u00b0C) or positive blood cultures, aside from the one in four bot- tles that grew bacillus species, bacteria that have not been associated with aortitis in the litera- ture. In summary, the only findings that would support a diagnosis of infectious aortitis were this patient\u2019s history of injection-drug use and the rapid aortic degeneration on imaging.\nLarge-Vessel Vasculitis\nLarge-vessel vasculitis usually involves major vessels, including the aorta and its proximal branches. Several autoimmune diseases, includ- ing Takayasu\u2019s arteritis, giant-cell arteritis, sar- coidosis, Kawasaki\u2019s disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Cogan\u2019s syndrome, can affect large vessels. In addition, other vasculitic processes, including polyarteritis nodosa, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, and IgG4- related disease, can cause findings similar to those seen in this patient.7\nAmong the possible causes of large-vessel vasculitis, Takayasu\u2019s arteritis is the most prob- able diagnosis in this case, given this patient\u2019s clinical and laboratory data.8 Takayasu\u2019s arteritis affects the ascending and descending aorta and can cause rapid dilation radially, which was seen in this patient. The most frequently reported symptoms are low-grade fever and malaise, which are consistent with the features of this patient\u2019s presentation. Takayasu\u2019s arteritis can occur in both men and women but typically oc- curs in women younger than 40 years of age. Although the prevalence is highest among Asian women, Takayasu\u2019s arteritis is known to occur in White women, as well. The American College of Rheumatology classification system for Takayasu\u2019s arteritis consists of the following six criteria: onset at younger than 40 years of age, claudica- tion of an arm or leg, a decreased pulse in the brachial artery, a difference in the systolic blood pressure between the two arms of more than 10 mm Hg, a bruit over the subclavian arteries or the aorta, and arteriographic evidence of nar- rowing or occlusion of the entire aorta, its pri- mary branches, or large arteries in the proximal arms or legs. The presence of three or more of these six criteria is associated with a sensitivity of 90.5% and a specificity of 97.8% for the diag- nosis of Takayasu\u2019s arteritis.9 This patient meets only two of these criteria \u2014 she is younger than 40 years of age and has a bruit over the subcla- vian arteries \u2014 which makes the diagnosis of Takayasu\u2019s arteritis less likely.\nThe remaining features of this case are not\nespecially helpful in establishing a diagnosis. There are no diagnostic laboratory tests specific for large-vessel vasculitis; the erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate and C-reactive protein level are neither sensitive nor specific. Indeed, elevated values would be expected with both vascular in- fection and active vasculitis, so these results were not helpful in differentiating between our lead- ing diagnoses in this patient. Rapid degenerative expansion of the affected vessel is uncommon in patients with Takayasu\u2019s arteritis but does not rule out this diagnosis, since there have been reports of rapid aneurysmal degeneration in patients with vasculitis of the aorta.10 Given this patient\u2019s age, the imaging findings, the absence of fever, the normal white-cell count on presen- tation to the other hospital, and the apparent improvement in her condition with the adminis- tration of glucocorticoids, despite the exceed- ingly rapid aortic degeneration, large-vessel vas- culitis remains a possible diagnosis in this case.\n\nDiagnostic Challenges\nAnother diagnostic possibility is the presence of both an underlying vascular disease that con- ferred a predisposition to aortic infection and a superimposed infection of the \u201ctraumatized\u201d aorta, probably introduced with injection-drug use. The term \u201clocus minoris resistentiae\u201d (\u201cthe location of least resistance\u201d) was used in the epic myth of Achilles to describe the notion that disease will occur in the location of the body that is most vulnerable to insult.11 Infections take the path of least resistance, and antecedent disease or trauma to the aorta would possibly serve as a nidus for infection. Hence, it is possible that this patient has an aortic wall infection oc- curring at a site of indolent vasculitis or of previ- ous vascular injury caused by adulterants of in- jected material.\nThis case was made more challenging by the fact that the treatments for active Takayasu\u2019s dis- ease and infectious aortitis are diametrically op- posed. The management of vasculitis should not include surgery on vessels with acute inflamma- tion. Instead, guidelines and most experts suggest treatment with glucocorticoids and observation for quiescence of disease, as evidenced by nor- malization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level.12 By contrast, the management of infectious aortitis, particularly cases associated with abscess and thrombus, includes prompt surgical intervention, d\u00e9bride- ment of infected tissue, and avoidance of gluco- corticoids and other immunosuppressive  agents.\n\nTemporizing Surgical Treatment\nGiven this challenging situation and the poten- tial risk of complications associated with delay- ing surgical management of infectious aortitis that does not have a clinical response to antibi- otic therapy, we opted to temporize with place- ment of a Gore endograft. We chose an endo- graft that does not have suprarenal fixation so that it would be easier to remove if reconstruction of the aorta were ultimately required. The endograft was placed in a percutaneous manner through the common femoral arteries on the day that the patient was transferred to this hospital. The graft lined the aorta from the level below the renal arteries to the level of the bilateral common iliac arteries to prevent acute aortic rupture and hemorrhagic death from occurring while the final diagnosis was being determined.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Jakob Moran: At the time of admission to this hospital, blood specimens were obtained for culture. After 72 hours of incubation and after endograft placement, one of four bottles (an aerobic bottle) was positive. Gram\u2019s staining of the blood-culture broth showed gram-positive cocci in clusters. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spec- trometry of the culture isolate identified the species as Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic suscep- tibility testing revealed methicillin resistance and susceptibility to vancomycin.\nDr. Moran: We performed an examination of two surgical specimens: aortic wall tissue, which consisted of an aggregate of tan-white fibrofatty soft tissue (measuring up to 6.1 cm), and aortic graft tissue, which consisted of an aggregate of white-to-yellow hemorrhagic and chalky fibro- fatty tissue (measuring up to 7.5 cm) that was attached to an aortic stent graft. Microscopic examination of both specimens revealed scar- ring in the fibroconnective and adipose tissue (Fig. 3A) with florid acute and chronic inflam- mation (Fig. 3B). Brown\u2013Hopps staining re- vealed gram-positive cocci in clusters (Fig. 3C). There was no evidence of active Takayasu\u2019s arte- ritis. Taken together, the histologic findings were consistent with acute infection involving the vascular graft and adjacent fibroconnective tissue.\nThe role of pathological examination in the diagnosis of vasculitis depends on the type of vasculitis, the type of sampling, and the clinical presentation. Takayasu\u2019s arteritis is typically di- agnosed on the basis of clinical and imaging findings and rarely requires pathological exami- nation.13 In this case, although the diagnosis of acute infection can account for the histopatho- logical changes observed in the specimens, cor- relation of these changes with the clinical and imaging findings would be needed to rule out Takayasu\u2019s arteritis.\n",
