    "Primary Symptom": "A 41-Year-Old Woman with Transient Ischemic Attack\nand Mitral Valve Masses\n",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 41-year-old woman with transient dysarthria and facial droop was transferred to this hospital for evaluation of masses on the mitral valve.\nThree weeks before this presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital because of concerns about heavy vaginal bleeding that had developed 1 week earlier and was associated with crampy abdominal pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and lightheadedness. Examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 130/79 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 100% while she was breathing ambient air; the examination was otherwise reportedly normal, although a gynecologic examination was not per- formed. Laboratory results were notable for a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g per deci- liter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0; previous level 1 year earlier, 9.1), a mean cor- puscular volume of 71.3 fl (reference range, 80 to 94), and a platelet count of 148,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000). Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable. Normal saline was administered intravenously, and a 5-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was prescribed.\nEleven days after the patient completed the therapy with medroxyprogesterone\nacetate (9 days before this presentation), heavy vaginal bleeding and dyspnea re- curred. An additional 3-day course of medroxyprogesterone acetate was pre- scribed. The evening after the patient finished the second course of treatment, within 1 hour after she had been seen and had appeared to be well, her husband noted that she had facial droop on the right side and slurred speech; he called emergency medical services. When she arrived at the emergency department of a second hospital, within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms, her examination was notable for a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 173/83 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 99% while she was breathing ambient air. She was noted to have facial droop on the right side and unintelligible speech.\nDr. Sandra P. Rincon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Fig. 1A) revealed no evidence of acute infarction or intracranial hemorrhage. Small chronic infarcts were seen in the right thalamus and right cerebellar hemisphere. A CT angiogram (CTA) of the head and neck did not show high-grade stenosis or large-vessel occlusion.\nDr. Nestor: A neurology consultation was ob- tained; aspirin and atorvastatin were adminis- tered. Blood levels of electrolytes, albumin, low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the white-cell count and differential count and the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable, and urinalysis showed 3+ blood, no protein, and no casts. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Within 45 minutes after the patient arrived at the emergency department of the second hospital, the facial asymmetry and dysarthria resolved. The patient was admitted to the medical unit of the second hospital.\nDr. Rincon: The next day, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography of the head and neck again revealed old lacunar infarcts in the right thalamus (Fig. 1B) and right cerebellar hemi- sphere (Fig. 1C). There was no evidence of an acute infarction (Fig. 1D), intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebrovascular occlusion (Fig. 1E and 1F).\nDr. Nestor: Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Post-transfusion laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A transthoracic echocar- diogram (Fig. 2A and 2B and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) showed thickened mitral valve leaflets and mild-to- moderate mitral regurgitation, with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg. Dr. Evin Yucel: On the third hospital day, a trans- esophageal echocardiogram (Fig. 2C and Videos 2 and 3) showed multiple echodensities on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the clo- sure lines that were consistent with vegetations.\nCultures of blood were obtained, and heparin\nwas administered intravenously.\nDr. Nestor: On the fourth hospital day, the rate of heparin infusion was decreased at 6-hour inter- vals when the partial-thromboplastin time ex- ceeded 150 seconds, until the infusion was stopped. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1; complement levels (C3 and C4) were normal. Ad- ditional cultures of blood were obtained.\nDr. Rincon: Repeat CT of the head revealed no acute abnormality. CT of the chest showed clus- tered nodules in the lower lobes that were prob- ably related to aspiration, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 2D, 2E, and 2F) revealed an en- larged heterogeneous uterus with multiple fibroids. Dr. Nestor: The next day, the patient was trans- ferred to this hospital. On a review of systems,she reported no recurrence of dysarthria or fa- cial droop and noted no other neurologic symp- toms. She reported that she had had heavy menstrual bleeding and exertional dyspnea in the weeks preceding this presentation; pruritic, macular rashes on the trunk, scalp, arms, and legs with associated photosensitivity that had persisted for many weeks; new Raynaud\u2019s phenom- enon in the past 10 months; and a long history of dry eyes and seasonal allergies. Medical his- tory was notable for sickle cell trait, vitamin B12 deficiency, iron deficiency resulting in past iron infusions, uterine fibroids, anxiety, and hypertension. Surgical history included multiple laparos- copies and two laparotomies, including salpingo- oophorectomy for endometriosis. Owing to infertility, she had undergone in vitro fertiliza- tion; she had a first-trimester spontaneous abor- tion at 25 years of age. During her second preg- nancy at 33 years of age, a screening rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was positive at 1:8; however, a treponemal-specific confirmatory test for syphilis was negative. Pregnancy-induced hy- pertension developed, followed by placental ab- ruption at 30 weeks, which resulted in a cesarean delivery. Medications included amlodipine, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, and medroxyproges- terone acetate. She had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient lived in eastern Massachusetts with her husband and child. She did not drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Her mother had rheu- matoid arthritis, hypertension, and a history of spontaneous abortion. One grandmother had diabetes and the other grandmother had had a stroke. An aunt had had leukemia and later breast cancer. Her child has psoriasis.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 155/98 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 175 cm, the weight 107 kg, and the body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 34.9. There were several small, circular macules on her back (Fig. 3). There was a grade 2/6 holosystolic mur- mur at the left sternal border and apex. She had no lymphadenopathy, petechiae, nail changes, or evidence of arthritis. The remainder of the examination was normal, as was a neurologic examination.\nLaboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAll the blood cultures obtained at the second hospital showed no growth. An electrocardio- gram was normal.\n\nTable 1.

Neuroimaging Studies.\nAn initial axial CT image of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material (Panel A), shows no acute intracranial abnormality. There was no large infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. The following day, magnetic resonance imaging of the head was performed. Axial T2\u00adweighted images show chronic infarcts in the right thalamus (Panel B, arrow) and right cerebellar hemi\u00ad sphere (Panel C, arrow). An axial diffusion\u00adweighted image (Panel D) shows no areas of restricted diffusion that would suggest an acute infarction. Maximum\u00adintensity\u00adprojection images were obtained from three\u00addimensional time\u00adof\u00adflight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the intracranial circulation (Panel E) and gadolinium\u00adenhanced MRA of the neck (Panel F). The images show no high\u00adgrade stenosis or occlusion of the major intracranial or cervical arteries.\n\nFigure 2. Echocardiograms and CT Scans of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nOn transthoracic echocardiography (Panel A), a parasternal long\u00adaxis view shows thickening at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets, a finding suggestive of vegetations (arrow). An apical three\u00adchamber view on transthoracic echocardiography (Panel B) again shows thickening at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets on the atrial surface. A transesophageal echocardiogram (Panel C) shows the vegetations (arrow) on the atrial side of the mitral valve leaflets at the closure lines. There was associated mild\u00adto\u00admoderate mitral regurgitation (not shown). Coronal (Panel D) and sagittal (Panel E) CT images of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained without the administration of intravenous con\u00ad trast material, show an enlarged heterogeneous uterus (Panel E, arrow). An axial CT image of the pelvis (Panel F) shows calcified uterine masses (arrows) that were consistent with fibroids. LA denotes left atrium, LV left ventricle, and MV mitral valve.\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mark A. Matza: The first step in developing a differential diagnosis in this case is to determine whether this patient\u2019s presentation is related to an inflammatory condition or a noninflamma- tory condition. Noninflammatory disorders to consider include transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke due to atherosclerotic disease or em- bolism, culture-negative infective endocarditis, fibroid-induced bleeding, and cancer. Possible inflammatory causes include nonbacterial throm- botic endocarditis, antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and vasculitis. I will focus on the individual features of this patient\u2019s presentation and see whether there are any clues that point to one or more of these diagnoses.\nProlonged Partial-Thromboplastin Time and Bleeding\nOne notable feature of this patient\u2019s presenta- tion is vaginal bleeding in the context of a slightly prolonged partial-thromboplastin time. This may be due to anticoagulation, an intrin- sic-factor deficiency (such as that which occurs in patients with hemophilia), or the presence of an inhibitor of coagulation. Acquired inhibi- tors can develop during pregnancy or in asso- ciation with cancer or connective-tissue dis- eases but can also be seen in nonpregnant, healthy persons. Furthermore, prolongation of the partial-thromboplastin time may indicate the presence of lupus anticoagulant, which is typically determined by sequential testing. First, a phospholipid-dependent screening test such as the dilute Russell\u2019s viper\u2013venom time test or a lupus anticoagulant\u2013sensitive activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT) test is per- formed. Subsequently, the failure of mixing studies to correct the prolongation of the aPTT indicates the presence of an inhibitor, rather than a factor deficiency. Finally, if the addition of excess phospholipid corrects the prolonga- tion, the presence of lupus anticoagulant is confirmed. Despite the name, lupus anticoagu- lant generally causes clotting in the venous or arterial system and rarely causes bleeding. Thus, the vaginal bleeding in this patient may be caused by another disorder such as uterine fibroids.\nFalse Positive Result on Rapid Plasma Reagin Test\nFalse positive results on nontreponemal serologic tests for syphilis are generally of low titer. It is important to confirm any reactive nontrepone- mal test such as the RPR test with a treponemal- specific test. Since this patient\u2019s RPR test did not confirm a diagnosis of syphilis, it is important to understand the conditions that are associated with a false positive RPR result. A false positive result may occur because of the detection of anticardio- lipin antibodies, since the antigen in the RPR test contains cardiolipin. A false positive RPR result can also occur in the context of pregnancy, acute febrile illnesses (e.g., endocarditis), chronic liver disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, recent immunizations, intravenous drug use, and autoimmune diseases such as APS and SLE.\n\nTransient Ischemic Attack and History of Pregnancy Complications\nThe most likely cause of TIA in this patient is embolic phenomena from valvular vegetation. Although women who have had a previous com- plicated pregnancy have a higher risk of stroke than women with previous uncomplicated preg- nancies,1 the combination of pregnancy compli- cations, miscarriage, and thromboembolic phe- nomena in this patient arouses suspicion of APS. APS is an autoimmune syndrome characterized by venous or arterial thrombosis, pregnancy com- plications, or both, in the context of a positive antiphospholipid antibody test. APS can be a primary disorder, or it can be a consequence of SLE or another autoimmune disease. The revised Sapporo criteria, also known as the Sydney cri- teria, can be helpful in the diagnosis of APS, which requires that a patient meet one clinical criterion and one laboratory criterion.2 The clin- ical criteria include vascular thrombosis or preg- nancy complications, and the laboratory criteria require the presence of one or more antiphos- pholipid antibodies with confirmatory testing.2 Although we do not yet know whether this pa- tient has antiphospholipid antibodies, there was concern about the presence of such antibodies, given the history of a positive RPR test and a prolonged partial-thromboplastin time.\nPhotosensitive Rash\nThe photosensitive nature of this patient\u2019s rash increases suspicion of connective-tissue disease,\n \nparticularly subacute cutaneous lupus erythema- tosus \u2014 perhaps the papulosquamous form, since the typical annular appearance is not evident. A biopsy of the rash can be helpful, although it is not always necessary; a skin specimen may show vacuolar interface dermatitis, which can occur with connective-tissue disease. Subacute cutane- ous lupus erythematosus is often associated with the presence of anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies. The rash seen on this patient\u2019s scalp arouses concern about discoid lupus, which generally affects the face, scalp, ears, and neck and can be associated with follicular plugging and scarring. These rashes in combination with new-onset Raynaud\u2019s phe- nomenon may be associated with a connective- tissue disease such as SLE. Although the comple- ment levels are normal, obtaining an autoantibody profile for this patient that includes tests for antinuclear antibody and antibodies to extract- able nuclear antigens is recommended.\nNonbacterial Thrombotic Endocarditis\nThe valvular vegetations identified on cardiac imaging in the context of negative blood cul- tures and no clear signs of infection are sugges- tive of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. This condition is characterized by sterile platelet thrombi that commonly adhere to the mitral and aortic valves. This is distinct from culture-neg- ative endocarditis, which is caused by micro- organisms that are difficult to culture. Nonbac- terial thrombotic endocarditis is often associated with advanced cancer but can also occur in patients with SLE or APS. Nonbacterial thrombotic endo- carditis is commonly known as Libman\u2013Sacks endocarditis in the context of SLE or APS \u2014 an entity first described in 1924 by Emanuel Lib- man and Benjamin Sacks.3 Up to 50% of patients with SLE or APS have valvular abnormalities.4\n\nMaking a Diagnosis\nThis patient\u2019s constellation of TIA, chronic in- farcts on imaging, pregnancy complications, a prolonged partial-thromboplastin time, and a false positive RPR test result is highly suggestive of APS. Given the report of a photosensitive rash and new-onset Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, there was concern about SLE. Finally, nonbacterial mitral valve vegetations and mitral valve leaflet thick- ening in the context of all these findings are most consistent with Libman\u2013Sacks endocardi- tis. Putting all the features of this case together,this patient most likely has Libman\u2013Sacks endo- carditis with associated APS and SLE.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sacha N. Uljon: Initial laboratory tests revealed a slightly prolonged partial-thromboplastin time with a normal prothrombin time. Common causes of isolated prolonged partial-thrombo- plastin time include heparin administration, certain coagulation factor deficiencies, and the presence of lupus anticoagulant. No heparin was detected in this patient\u2019s blood sample, and the results of partial-thromboplastin time coagula- tion factor studies were normal (Table 2). A screening lupus anticoagulant\u2013sensitive aPTT test was positive, and the blood sample did not correct the prolongation of the aPTT when it was mixed with normal plasma. The presence of lupus anticoagulant was confirmed when the partial- thromboplastin time shortened after the addition of excess phospholipid. Further testing revealed elevated levels of anticardiolipin IgG and anti\u03b22-glycoprotein 1 IgG. Taken together, these results constitute \u201ctriple positive\u201d findings for the presence of lupus anticoagulant, the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s prolonged partial- thromboplastin time. To meet the laboratory cri- teria for APS, either a lupus anticoagulant test or a test for any one of the antibodies repeated at least 12 weeks later must show a positive result.6 Some laboratory tests that were performed at the second hospital were repeated on presenta- tion to this hospital, resulting in duplicate sets of results (Table 2). An assay in which HEp-2 cell substrate was used to confirm the presence of antinuclear antibodies in a sample evaluated in our hospital laboratory was positive at a titer of 1:160 with a homogeneous pattern. A test for antinuclear antibodies that had been performed at the second hospital 5 days earlier was positive at a titer of 1:320 with a similar pattern (Table 2). Tests for anti-Smith and anti-RNP antibodies were weakly positive when they were performed at the second hospital; results were normal in our laboratory. Anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies were pres- ent in the samples evaluated at both laboratories.Results of tests for anti-La (SSB) antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were nor- mal at both laboratories.\nThe results obtained from the laboratory at the second hospital were similar but not identical to those obtained from our laboratory; this may be explained by biologic variation over time, preanalytic factors such as specimen handling, or interassay variability. Nationwide proficiency testing, in which identical samples are sent to hundreds of laboratories for comparison, shows a similar degree of variability across platforms.7 This variability compounds the difficulty of devel- oping strict laboratory criteria for SLE.8 Although the diagnosis of SLE does not hinge on one laboratory result,9 the combination of positive antinuclear antibody tests, positive lupus antico- agulant tests, and the presence of anti-Smith antibodies in this patient supports the clinical diagnosis of SLE.\nTable 2.
