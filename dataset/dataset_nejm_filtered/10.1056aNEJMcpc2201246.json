    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Javier A. Suarez (Neurology): A 32-year-old man was admitted to this hospital after 2 weeks of confusion and headache and 2 days of fever.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before admis- sion, when his wife noted that he began to have behavior suggestive of anxiety. Two weeks before admission, his wife noted that he began to have confusion; for example, he was unable to recall the ages of his children or to correctly identify the date. At that time, headache and neck stiffness developed. Two days before admission, fever developed. On the day of admission, the patient had worsening confusion and somnolence, and his wife brought him to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn presentation, the patient was not able to provide any history but was ac- companied by his wife, who described his recent symptoms. His medical record showed a 10-year history of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, which had initially been complicated by oral and genital ulcers and intermittent fever. During the following decade, flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had been associated with various manifestations: pulmo- nary embolism, iliac artery aneurysm and dissection, bilateral renal vein throm- bosis, erythema nodosum, deep venous thrombosis, uveitis, an inferior vena cava clot complicated by superior vena cava syndrome that led to thrombectomy, and renal infarction. The flares of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had usually included oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, or fever.\nPast treatment for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease had included azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Two years before this presentation, treatment with azathioprine and cyclosporine was discontinued and adalimumab initiated. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone resulted in flares of genital and oral ulcers. The frequency of adalimumab administration was increased to weekly, but genital and oral ulcers persisted. Thirteen months before this presentation, treatment with adalimumab was stopped and infliximab initiated. Diffuse arthralgias developed that were at- tributed to infliximab. Twelve months before this presentation, treatment with infliximab was stopped and golimumab initiated.\nOther medical history included an episode of lymphocyte-predominant meningitis, which had been diagnosed during an evaluation for head- ache, fever, and neck pain 17 months before this presentation. During the episode, there was a 72-hour delay in performing lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal f luid (CSF) analysis because the patient had been taking apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. While he was awaiting lumbar puncture, broad-spec- trum antibiotic agents were administered, and the headache, fever, and neck pain resolved. CSF analysis revealed normal levels of glucose and total protein, no red cells, and a nucleated-cell count of 88 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 97% lymphocytes and 3% monocytes. Nucleic acid amplification testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was nega- tive, and Gram\u2019s staining revealed no organisms.\n Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued, and the patient was discharged home.\nThere was also a history of coronavirus dis- ease 2019, which had been diagnosed 16 months before this presentation. Current medications included golimumab, apixaban, prednisone, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. There were no known allergies. The patient lived with his wife and four children. He had previously worked in construction; he had been released from prison 3 months before this presentation and was not currently working. He had a remote history of smoking tobacco; he did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. His grandmother had hypertension. On examination in the emergency depart- ment, the patient was somnolent but arose in response to verbal stimuli. His level of alertness f luctuated, he was only intermittently able to answer simple questions, and he could not pro- vide a coherent history of his illness. The tempera- ture was 39.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 122/71 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.7. He was oriented to person and place but not to time. There was no neck stiff- ness. Mild injection in the left eye was present, but there were no oral or skin lesions. The pa- tient was not able to participate fully in a neuro- logic examination, but he was able to move his arms and legs; no focal neurologic findings were noted on observation. The remainder of the\nexamination was normal.\nBlood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were results of liver-function, kidney- function, and coagulation tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis re- vealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The blood acetaminophen level was less than\n5.0 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 25.0); blood testing for ethanol was negative. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for respira- tory viral pathogens was positive for human rhinovirus or enterovirus. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were ob- tained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: A chest radiograph was\nnormal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed mucosal thickening with layering fluid levels  in  both  maxillary sinuses,  but  the study was otherwise normal. CT angiography of the head and neck, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed normal arterial and venous vasculature. Dr. Suarez: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftri- axone, ampicillin, and acyclovir was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treat- ment with apixaban was stopped and heparin administered intravenously in anticipation of performing a lumbar puncture. Fever and head- ache abated, but the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Blood cultures showed no growth. On the fourth hospital day, a lumbar puncture was performed. The opening pressure was not obtained. CSF analysis revealed a normal total protein level, a glucose level of 40 mg per deci- liter (2.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), a red-cell count of 2 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and a nucleated-cell count of 284 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 72%\nlymphocytes, 13% neutrophils, 11% monocytes, and 4% unclassified cells. Nucleic acid amplifi- cation testing for herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 DNA was negative, and Gram\u2019s stain- ing revealed no organisms. No acid-fast bacilli were observed on a mycobacterial smear, and no fungi were seen on examination of a fungal wet preparation. Testing of the CSF for cryptococcal antigen and enterovirus RNA was negative.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Nagagopal Venna: I was involved in the care of this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. This 32-year-old man was noted by his wife to have progressive confusion over a 2-week period and was brought to this hospital after headache,  neck stiffness, and fever developed. Of note, the patient had a history of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease with multisystemic complications, which had been in remission with the use of prednisone and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2013inhibitor therapy. This pa- tient\u2019s clinical picture \u2014 fluctuating alertness, incoherent answers, and inability to provide a history, in the absence of elementary neurologic abnormalities \u2014 can be characterized as acute confusional encephalopathy. Although this fa- miliar and common disorder is most often due to a readily identifiable infection or other cause of toxic metabolic encephalopathy, it can also be a sign of life-threatening illness and is best ap- proached as a medical emergency, with rapid examination and diagnostic testing.\n\nAcute Confusional Encephalopathy\nPatients with acute confusional encephalopathy are typically unable to engage in examination maneuvers, but simple observation of the patient can offer useful information. For example, pa- tients with toxic metabolic encephalopathy usu- ally have preserved eye movements and pupillary reactions. In contrast, the presence of nystag- mus, impaired extraocular movements, or asym- metry in pupillary size or response to light is indicative of brain-stem distress.\nIn addition, patients with toxic metabolic en- cephalopathy frequently have multifocal myoclo- nus, asterixis, and carphologia (constant picking at clothes). However, the development of staring spells associated with lip-smacking, sniffing, swallowing, or more complex automatisms is consistent with nonconvulsive status epilepticus, a condition that mimics acute confusional en- cephalopathy, in which fluctuations in respon- siveness are due to the staring spells.1\nIn patients with an autoimmune encephalopa- thy such as encephalitis associated with anti\u2013 N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies who present with acute confusional encepha- lopathy, the presence of characteristic chorea or dystonic movements can be a clue to the diag- nosis. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are a distinctive feature that is strongly suggestive of encephalitis associated with anti\u2013leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) receptor antibodies.2 On observation, this patient had normal pupil- lary reactions and did not have staring spells, automatisms, or dystonic movements.\nAnother condition that can mimic acute con- fusional encephalopathy is receptive aphasia (also known as Wernicke\u2019s aphasia), which is due to left middle cerebral artery territory infarction. Patients with such an infarction do not have the focal sensory or motor signs that are usually seen in patients with stroke; speech is typically fluent, grammatically correct, and well articu- lated but is characterized by neologisms and paraphasias. The presence of profoundly im- paired comprehension of spoken and written speech is the key to the diagnosis, although it can be mistaken for acute confusional encephalopathy. This patient was intermittently able to answer questions appropriately and appeared to have intact comprehension, which makes this diagnosis unlikely.\nInitial laboratory testing did not reveal toxins, metabolic derangements, or evidence of extra- neural infection. Therefore, the patient\u2019s acute confusional encephalopathy, as well as the fever, headache, and neck stiffness, are most likely due to acute encephalitis. Acute encephalitis in this patient could be caused by new manifestations of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, complications of treatment for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, or a different disease pro- cess altogether.\n\nAcute Encephalitis\nNeuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\nThe patient had had an episode of acute lympho- cytic meningitis 17 months before this presenta- tion. During the episode, no infectious causes were identified and symptoms resolved quickly.  I suspect that this had been an episode of asep- tic meningitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease.3 Patients with aseptic meningitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease are typically not as ill as patients with bacterial meningitis, and the presence of concurrent oral or genital ulcers, uveitis, or arthritis can be a  clue to the diagnosis. Although aseptic meningi- tis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease can be recurrent, this patient\u2019s current presentation with acute confu- sional encephalopathy is not consistent with this diagnosis.\nEncephalitis is an uncommon complication of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease that is caused by small-vessel vasculitis with a predominant component of venulitis.4 There is a predilection for involvement of the brain stem and diencephalon, and charac- teristic clinical manifestations include dysar- thria, dysphagia, double vision, abnormal ocular movements, and sensory, motor, and gait abnor- malities. Although encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease remains a possible diagnosis in this pa- tient, the absence of the expected neurologic manifestations after weeks of illness prompts consideration of other causes of encephalitis.5\nOther types of neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease \u2014 which encompasses a broad range of neurologic complications of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease \u2014 are un- likely to explain this patient\u2019s presentation. Intracranial venous sinus thrombosis is a well- documented complication of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease,\n \n\nbut patients who have this complication present with worsening headache, vision impairment, and papilledema due to intracranial hypertension. Occlusion or dissection of the craniocervical artery, internal carotid artery, or a vertebral ar- tery and intracranial aneurysm occur rarely in patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, but these compli- cations would not explain this patient\u2019s fever, neck stiffness, and acute confusional syndrome. In addition, CT angiography of the head and neck showed normal vasculature.\n\nAdverse Effects of TNF-Inhibitor Therapy\nThis patient had been receiving TNF-inhibitor therapy for 2 years before this presentation. Cere- bral complications of TNF-inhibitor therapy are rare and characterized by demyelinating lesions with corresponding focal sensory, motor, and less often cognitive changes, which resemble features of multiple sclerosis.6 Although magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) would be necessary to evaluate for demyelinating lesions, the patient\u2019s clinical presentation is not suggestive of this diagnosis.\n\nInfectious Encephalitis\nThis patient\u2019s prolonged immunosuppression from treatment with prednisone and TNF-inhibitor therapy suggests the possibility of an opportu- nistic infection. Immunosuppression associated with TNF-inhibitor therapy confers a predisposi- tion to reactivation of latent tuberculosis, inva- sive fungal infections, and bacterial infections, particularly listeriosis. This patient is also at risk for reactivation of latent viral infections, includ- ing herpes simplex virus infection and varicella\u2013 zoster virus infection. Encephalitis due to a seasonal virus that is endemic in New England\n\u2014 such as eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, or Powassan virus \u2014 is also a relevant consideration in this patient, although he is not at particularly increased risk. Patients with infectious encephalitis often present with a nonspecific febrile acute confusional encepha- lopathy; however, this initial presentation is fol- lowed by rapid neurologic decline, which this patient did not have, even after weeks of symp- toms. In addition, encephalitis due to listeria or  a seasonal virus is typically characterized by progressive brain-stem dysfunction, which this patient did not have.\nAutoimmune Encephalitis\nAutoimmune encephalitis is increasingly recog- nized as a condition that mimics infectious en- cephalitis.7 During the past 15 years, various encephalitic syndromes have been associated with specific neural antibodies, including anti- bodies against NMDA, LGI1, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, as well as anti\u2013 glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) antibod- ies and antineuronal nuclear antibodies type 1 (ANNA1). Patients with autoimmune encephali- tis may initially have only acute confusional encephalopathy. However, chorea, dystonic movements, seizures, specific memory impairments,and psychiatric symptoms often develop in asso- ciation with autoimmune encephalitis, and none of these features were seen in this patient, even after weeks of symptoms. It would be appropri- ate to test this patient for neural antibodies in the serum and CSF, since early diagnosis and treatment with immunotherapy can lead to re- markable recovery in patients with autoimmune encephalitis.\n\nCNS Vasculitis\nPrimary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis is presumed to be immune-mediated, and affect- ed patients can present with headache and acute confusional encephalopathy. However, the dis- ease course is typically punctuated by strokes. This patient is not at particularly increased risk for primary CNS vasculitis, but further diagnos- tic testing with MRI would be necessary to rule out this diagnosis.\n\nNarrowing the Differential Diagnosis\nCan the results of CSF analysis provide any clues to the most likely diagnosis in this case? A CSF specimen that was obtained on the fourth hos- pital day showed a mostly lymphocytic cellular response. However, there was a substantial proportion of neutrophils, and the glucose level was slightly low. The intense CSF pleocytosis makes autoimmune encephalitis unlikely. This CSF pro- file, along with the clinical presentation, confirms that encephalitis is the cause of the patient\u2019s acute confusional encephalopathy. A neutro- philic response and low glucose level in  the CSF are typical features of encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, although this profile is not commonly recognized. However, these CSF abnormalities can also be seen with early bacterial infections (including listeriosis) and with myco- bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, so an investigation for these infections needs to be performed, especially in this context of treat- ment-induced immunosuppression.8 Although encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease was consid- ered to be the most likely diagnosis in this pa- tient, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy was continued, and further diagnostic testing with MRI was performed.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Schaefer: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images from MRI of the head (Fig. 2), obtained on the fifth hospital day, showed patchy hyper- intense signal abnormalities in the pons, mid- brain, thalami, right lentiform nucleus, right internal capsule, and right caudate nucleus. There was no associated restricted diffusion, abnormal enhancement, hemorrhage, or mass effect. There was no evidence of acute arterial infarction or venous sinus thrombosis. \nDr. Venna:  Encephalitis due  to listeria was of particular concern in this immunosuppressed patient.10 However, the absence of enhancing discrete nodular lesions or abscesses on MRI, in addition to the absence of cerebellar and brain- stem dysfunction, made listeriosis an unlikely diagnosis. This patient\u2019s imaging findings were characteristic of encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease and provided strong supportive evidence for this diagnosis. However, as with systemic Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, there is no diagnostic labora- tory test or imaging finding to definitively es- tablish the diagnosis of encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. Similar MRI findings involving the thalami, basal ganglia, and brain stem are also typical of encephalitis due to eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, or Powassan virus. Despite the lack of certainty regarding the diagnosis, treatment for encephalitis due to Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease was the next step, followed by observation for a rapid and clear response to treatment, as evidenced by both clinical and radiologic improvement.\n\nFigure 2.
