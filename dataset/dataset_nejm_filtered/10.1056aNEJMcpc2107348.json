    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Daryl J. Selen: A 29-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent bone fractures and hypophosphatemia.\nThe patient had been well until 19 months before admission, when pain in the right midfoot developed during a vacation in Europe. On her return to the United States, she was evaluated by her primary care physician at a clinic affiliated with another hospital; an orthotic device was recommended, but the foot pain did not decrease with use of the device.\nThree months later, the pain in the right foot increased in severity after a sec- ond vacation in Europe. Radiography of the right foot reportedly revealed no fracture; physical therapy was recommended. During the subsequent 8 months, the pain continued to gradually increase in severity, was worse when the patient stood upright or walked, and was relieved with the administration of ibuprofen.\nEight months before admission, the patient tripped, and the severity of pain in the right foot increased suddenly. She was evaluated in the orthopedic clinic of this hospital. On examination, the height was 173 cm, the weight 115 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 38.6. There was tenderness over the right third metatarsal. Imaging stud- ies were obtained.\nDr. Rene Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Fig. 1A) revealed a fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the right foot re- vealed a nondisplaced, incompletely healed transverse fracture of the third meta- tarsal shaft, as well as subchondral sclerosis and bone marrow edema within the distal navicular bone and in the calcaneocuboid joint. Bone stimulation was rec- ommended, but the patient\u2019s pain did not abate after these treatments.\nDr. Selen: Seven months before admission, the patient had increased pain in the right foot after a fall while walking on ice. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Radiography of the right foot (Fig. 1B) revealed fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals.\nDr. Selen: Five months before admission, the second metatarsal region of the right foot was tender on palpation after the patient had walked up a flight of stairs. However, no evidence of a fracture was seen on radiography.\nFour months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic affili- ated with the other hospital. The calcium level was 9.5 mg per deciliter (2.4 mmol per liter; refer- ence range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.1 to 2.6 mmol per liter]), the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 26 ng per milliliter (65 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per deciliter [50 to 200 nmol\n \nper liter]), and the parathyroid hormone level 45 pg per milliliter (reference range, 10 to 60); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed for the assessment of bone mineral density, revealed normal bone mass in the lumbar spine (z score, 0.0; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9) and in the femo- ral neck (z score, 0.4; reference range, 1.9 to \u22121.9). Calcium and vitamin D supplementation and weight loss were recommended. The pain in the right foot persisted, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Three months before admission, MRI of the right foot (Fig. 1C and 1D) showed a non- displaced fracture of the second metatarsal metadiaphysis with associated bone and soft- tissue edema, a nondisplaced fracture of the medial cuneiform, and healing fractures of the third, fourth, and fifth metatarsals. A controlled ankle motion walking boot and crutches were recommended for ambulation.\nDr. Selen: During the next 3 months, the pain in the right foot persisted, and new pain devel- oped in the left foot. The patient was seen in the pain medicine and podiatry clinics affiliated with the other hospital. Diagnoses of plantar fasciitis, Achilles\u2019 tendinitis, and sinus tarsi syn- drome were considered. Treatment with methyl- prednisolone and celecoxib was initiated, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation in the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported bilateral foot and ankle pain and swelling that was greater in the right foot and ankle than in the left, as well as stiffness and warmth in the ankles. There was lower back pain and bilateral hip pain, which was greater on the right side than on the left side. The pa- tient reported that the back and hip pain had been present since she was a teenager but had gradually increased in severity during the previ- ous year. Fatigue and generalized weakness had developed and worsened during the previous month. There was no fever, weight loss, or change in diet.\nMenarche had occurred when the patient was\n11 years of age, and menstrual cycles had been regular since then. There was a history of frac- tures of the left wrist in childhood. Other medical history included obesity, hyperlipidemia, anxiety, nephrolithiasis, biliary dyskinesia (which had led to cholecystectomy 1 year before this admis- sion), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease diag- nosed on the basis of a liver biopsy. Medications included celecoxib, ergocalciferol, citalopram, and lorazepam; she had no known drug aller- gies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and had previously worked as a nurse; however, she was unable to work during the previous 8 months because of pain and dif- ficulty with ambulation. She did not smoke ciga- rettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had osteopenia; her mother, father, and sister had psoriasis; her father had psoriatic arthri- tis; and her brother had the Williams syndrome, a rare genetic and developmental disorder.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/78, and the heart rate 94 beats per minute. Dentition was normal, and the gait was antalgic. Proximal muscle strength was intact in both arms (5/5) and slightly reduced in the  legs  (4/5).  There  was  tenderness  over  the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints that was more pronounced on the right side than on the left side. The FABER test \u2014 in which the leg is flexed and the thigh is abducted and externally rotated \u2014 elicited pain in both hips. There was tenderness over the right midfoot and warmth and swelling of the ankles. No musculoskeletal deformities, bowing of the legs, lymphadenopa- thy, skin lesions, or rashes were noted. The blood level of phosphorus was 1.0 mg per deci- liter (0.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 2.6 to 4.5 mg per deciliter [0.8 to 1.5 mmol per liter]);\nother laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was instructed to go to the emer- gency department of this hospital. Intravenous sodium phosphate and oral potassium phosphate were administered. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Balza: Radiography of the lumbar spine, pelvis, hips, and ankles revealed anterolisthesis of L4 and L5 with a defect in the pars interarticu- laris; there were no fractures. On radiography of the right foot, a fracture in the third metatarsal was initially identified 8 months before admission (Fig. 1A), followed by the development of frac- tures in the fourth and fifth metatarsals 1 month later (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, T2-weighted MRI of the sacrum with fat suppression performed on admission (Fig. 1E and 1F) revealed vertically oriented hypointense bands in the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontally oriented hypoin- tense band in S2, as well as bone marrow edema adjacent to the fracture lines; the combination of these findings was consistent with an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture.\n\nFigure 1. Initial Imaging Studies of the Foot and Sacrum.\nA radiograph of the right foot obtained 8 months before admission (Panel A) shows a nondisplaced fracture of the third metatarsal shaft with peripheral callus formation (arrow). A radiograph of the right foot obtained 7 months before admission (Panel B) again shows a non\u2011 displaced fracture of the third metatarsal shaft with peripheral callus formation (arrow), as well as new minimally displaced fractures of the distal fourth and fifth metatarsals (arrowheads). Long\u2011axis T2\u2011weighted fat\u2011suppressed images from MRI of the right foot performed 3 months before admission (Panels C and D) show a new nondisplaced fracture of the distal second metatarsal (Panel C, arrow) with associated bone marrow edema (Panel C, asterisk) and surrounding soft\u2011tissue edema (Panel C, arrowheads). There is also a nondis\u2011 placed fracture of the medial cuneiform (Panel D, arrow) and previously identified fractures of the distal third, fourth, and fifth meta\u2011 tarsals (Panel D, arrowheads) with minimal bone marrow edema. A T2\u2011weighted fat\u2011suppressed coronal image from MRI of the sacrum performed on admission (Panel E) shows vertically oriented stress fractures of the bilateral sacral alae (arrows) with surrounding bone marrow edema (asterisks). A T2\u2011weighted fat\u2011suppressed sagittal image of the sacrum (Panel F) shows a horizontally oriented fracture through S2 (arrowhead).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael J. Econs: When evaluating a patient with multiple fractures, obtaining a thorough history is critical. First, if the history provided by the patient regarding the cause of the fractures does not seem to make sense, physical abuse must be considered. Second, if the patient has had a lifelong history of fractures, or the fractures occur with low levels of trauma, the suspicion of a genetic bone fragility disorder increases. In this patient, the history and pattern of fractures are not suggestive of abuse, and the fractures occurred recently. Next, we can turn to her labo- ratory studies for additional information.\n\nInterpretation   of    Laboratory   Test   Results The process of interpreting this patient\u2019s labora- tory test results illustrates several important clinical principles. First, interpretation of labo- ratory values is not binary. The values are not just normal or abnormal, but rather should be interpreted with an understanding of how far outside the normal range they are. This patient\nhad marked hypophosphatemia; a blood phos- phorus level of 1.0 mg per deciliter is very low, and there is the potential for hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis.1 Second, it is important to in- terpret laboratory values in the context of the patient\u2019s physiologic state. In patients with hypo- phosphatemia, the normal physiologic response is to increase the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to restore phosphate homeostasis. Even a low- normal level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D would be physiologically inappropriate; this patient\u2019s level was markedly low. Third, this patient had an elevated alkaline phosphatase level and a normal bicarbonate level \u2014 a pattern often seen in the context of osteomalacia.\n\nHypophosphatemia\nThere are many causes of hypophosphatemia (Table 2). Acute hypophosphatemia is common among hospitalized patients and frequently re- sults from carbohydrate refeeding or intracellular shifts, as is often seen in patients being treated for diabetic ketoacidosis.\nThis patient\u2019s presentation and clinical exami- nation, as well as imaging studies showing de- mineralized bone, are consistent with chronic hypophosphatemia. A key branch point in the differential diagnosis is to determine whether the hypophosphatemia was due to impaired in- testinal absorption or increased renal excretion. She had no history of use of phosphate binders or antacid medications. Surreptitious use of these agents could have occurred; however, if this were the case, the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D would be elevated as a compensatory mecha- nism to restore phosphate homeostasis. Although this patient had a low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was within\n \n\nthe normal range, which rules out vitamin D deficiency. Of note, vitamin D deficiency would not typically cause the profound issues that were seen in this patient. In addition, in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency, the parathyroid hor- mone level would be elevated, and it was normal in this patient. Taken together, a renal cause of hypophosphatemia is the most likely explanation in this patient.\n\nIncreased   Renal   Excretion   of   Phosphate Causes of phosphate wasting in the kidney in- clude hyperparathyroidism, hereditary hypophos- phatemic rickets with hypercalciuria, and use of diuretic agents. Hyperparathyroidism can be ruled out in this case, because the patient had normal levels of parathyroid hormone and cal- cium. Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with\nhypercalciuria, a genetic form of hypophospha- temia caused by mutations in NPT2a,3 is unlikely in this patient, given that there was no sugges- tive family history and that the hypophosphate- mia developed in adulthood. She had no history of diuretic use and no other electrolyte abnormali- ties that would suggest surreptitious diuretic use. Fanconi\u2019s syndrome is a renal tubule disorder that causes hypophosphatemia. Genetic forms of Fanconi\u2019s syndrome typically manifest in child- hood. Drug-induced Fanconi\u2019s syndrome can oc- cur in children and adults, but this patient had no known exposure to drugs that are associated with Fanconi\u2019s syndrome, such as cisplatin or tenofovir. In addition, this patient\u2019s normal lev- els of bicarbonate and potassium combined with the absence of glucose in the urine make Fan-\nconi\u2019s syndrome an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nFGF23-Mediated Renal Excretion of Phosphate The next branch point in the differential diag- nosis of hypophosphatemia in this patient is whether the renal excretion of phosphate is me- diated by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23, a hormone that is produced in bone, signals the kidney to excrete phosphate and de- crease the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin\nD.4 FGF23 plays an important role in normal phosphate and vitamin D homeostasis.5 Excessive FGF23 levels occur in association with cer- tain disease states that can lead to hypophos- phatemia.\nGenetic causes include X-linked hypophospha- temia, autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets, and autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR).2 These disorders typically manifest in childhood and are unlikely diagno- ses in this case, although ADHR can have de- layed onset of penetrance, particularly in women.6 Genetic testing would be necessary to definitively rule out ADHR; however, this patient had no suggestive family history of this disorder.\nAcquired FGF23-Mediated Hypophosphatemia FGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia is fairly common in patients who have been treated with ferric carboxymaltose, but this condition is also\nassociated with iron isomaltoside.7 However, this patient had no history of intravenous iron administration.\nFGF23-mediated hypophosphatemia that manifests in adulthood is often caused by tumors that secrete FGF23. Although many types of tumors can secrete FGF23, the most common is referred to as a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor of the mixed connective-tissue type (PMTMCT).8 Patients with a PMTMCT present with isolated hypophosphatemia, an inappropri- ately normal or low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, osteomalacia (and rickets in children), bone pain, and proximal muscle weakness.9 Un- fortunately, diagnosis is often delayed, and pa- tients may be wheelchair-bound or bedbound by the time of diagnosis. The tumor can be found almost anywhere in the body, is usually benign, and can be removed or ablated, although it can recur years later. Tumor-induced osteomalacia is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. I sus- pect that the diagnostic test was assessment for an elevated blood level of FGF23, followed by imaging studies to identify a tumor. It is prudent to make a biochemical or genetic diagnosis of tumor-induced osteomalacia before performing imaging studies, because the tumor can occur anywhere in the body and false positive imaging studies are common.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Laboratory Analysis\nDr. Selen: Blood and urine samples for the mea- surement of phosphorus and creatinine levels were obtained while the patient was fasting. The fractional excretion of phosphate was calculated with the following equation: (urine phosphorus level\u00d7 blood creatinine level\u00d7 100)\u00f7 (blood phos- phorus level\u00d7 urine creatinine level). In the con- text of hypophosphatemia, a normal fractional excretion of phosphate value is less than 5%. The fractional excretion of phosphate in this pa- tient was 11.6% \u2014 a result that suggests that the kidneys were excreting excess phosphate, prompt- ing us to evaluate the blood levels of FGF23.\nDr. Yin P. Hung: Intact circulating FGF23 is bio-\nactive. Cleavage of intact FGF23 generates a bio- logically inactive N-terminal fragment and a biologically inactive C-terminal fragment. There are generally two types of commercial enzyme- linked immunosorbent assays that use antibody conjugates for assessment of FGF23. The iFGF23 assay measures intact FGF23, and the cFGF23 assay provides a composite measurement of both the intact form and the C-terminal fragment of FGF23. The blood level of cFGF23 in this patient was found to be elevated, at 202 reference units (RU) per milliliter (reference value, \u2264180), which confirmed the diagnosis of FGF23-dependent hypophosphatemia.\nDr. Selen: To determine the source of the elevated level of FGF23, additional imaging studies were obtained.\n\nAnatomical Localization of Source of Excess FGF23\nDr. Balza: Combined gallium-68\u2013dotatate positron- emission tomography\u2013computed tomography was performed (Fig. 2). Several sites of abnormal uptake were present in the axial and appendicu- lar skeleton. Uptake was most pronounced in a sclerotic lesion in the left femoral head (the most likely site of tumor in patients with PMTMCT) and was slightly less pronounced in known frac- tures in the right foot. Other notable sites of uptake included multiple bilateral rib fractures, a sacral fracture, bilateral pubic fractures, a fracture in the right calcaneus, and a lytic lesion in the C7 vertebral body.\nTo further characterize the lesion in C7, an MRI of the cervical spine was performed (Fig. 2). The lesion had a hyperintense appearance on short-tau inversion recovery images and was slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images. These findings were indeterminate, with possi- bilities including neoplasm and lipid-poor hem- angioma.\nDr. Omar Zurkiya: In patients with osteomala- cia and an elevated level of FGF23, evaluation of blood samples obtained from the venous drain- age close to the suspected lesion can help to identify and confirm the source of FGF23.10 In this patient, the available diagnostic imaging findings narrowed the search for the source of FGF23 to the left femoral head and the C7 verte- bral body. The venous drainage of the left femo- ral head f lows primarily through the medial circumflex femoral vein, with secondary drainage through the lateral circumflex femoral vein and the left gluteal vein. These ultimately drain into the left iliac vein and the inferior vena cava. The venous drainage of the C7 vertebral body flows through the vertebral veins bilaterally to the subclavian veins and ultimately into the superior vena cava.\nEndovascular access was obtained by first inserting a catheter through the right common femoral vein and then performing selective cath- eterization of the target vessels. Samples were obtained as selectively as possible, with samples that were progressively less selective as they were obtained more centrally to the inferior vena cava and superior vena cava.\nRepeat measurement of the FGF23 level re- vealed a peripheral blood value of 196 RU per milliliter. The levels in the vertebral venous samples were 197 RU per milliliter in the left vein and 202 RU per milliliter in the right vein, which were consistent with the peripheral blood level. The level was 480 RU per milliliter in the medial circumflex femoral vein, 326 RU per milli- liter in the left lateral circumflex femoral vein, and 335 RU milliliter in the left gluteal vein. These findings localized the source of FGF23 to the left femoral head. A bone biopsy of the femoral head was performed.\n\nFigure 2. Diagnostic Imaging Studies.\nCombined gallium\u201168\u2013dotatate positron\u2011emission tomography and computed tomography (PET\u2011CT) was performed (Panels A through D). A PET image (Panel A) shows focal uptake (arrow) with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 43.12 and physiologic activity in the bladder (arrowhead). A CT image (Panel B) shows a sclerotic lesion in the left femoral head (arrow) that corresponds to the focal uptake seen in Panel A. Another PET image (Panel C) shows physiologic thyroid uptake (asterisk) and focal uptake (arrow) (SUVmax, 5.02) that corresponds to a heteroge\u2011 neous lytic lesion in the C7 vertebral body (Panel D, arrow) seen on CT images. On a short\u2011tau inversion recovery sagittal image from MRI of the cervical spine (Panel E), the lesion in C7 has a hyperintense appearance (arrow); on a T1\u2011weighted image (Panel F), the lesion is slightly hypointense (arrow).\n",
