    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jacqueline N. Chu: A 44-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain.\nApproximately 6 months before admission, the patient began to have early satiety, nausea approximately 30 minutes after eating small amounts of food, and intermittent anorexia. He began to consume primarily liquids for breakfast and lunch and would skip dinner; during the next 5 months, he lost 9 kg.\nOne month before admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of fever, malaise, neck pain, photophobia, retro-orbital pain, and head- ache. The temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, and the blood  pressure  94/72  mm  Hg.  The  white-cell  count  was  28,600  per  microliter (reference range, 4500 to 10,800); other laboratory test results are shown in Ta- ble 1. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was reportedly normal. Empirical vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and dexametha- sone were administered intravenously. A lumbar puncture (opening pressure not recorded) revealed cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with 4 red cells per microliter and 1306 white cells per microliter, of which 83% were neutrophils (reference value, <25%), 12% were monocytes, and 5% were lymphocytes. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no organisms; the CSF protein level was 98 mg per deciliter (ref- erence range, 15 to 45) and the glucose level was 68 mg per deciliter (3.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 35 to 65 mg per deciliter [1.9 to 3.6 mmol per liter]).\nOn the third day at the other hospital, dysuria, nausea, and episodes of hemop-\ntysis and diarrhea developed. CT of the chest and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material; the results were reportedly unremarkable. On the fifth hospital day, after CSF culture revealed no growth and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 was negative, antimicrobial and glucocorticoid therapies were discontinued and the patient was discharged home. The vitamin B12  level and results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal; other laboratory test results obtained the day before discharge are shown in Table 1.\nAfter the patient\u2019s discharge from the other hospital, new, near-constant epigastric pain de- veloped. Approximately 1 hour after meals, nausea and vomiting occurred, with diffuse abdominal bloating and cramping. In addition, watery diar- rhea began to occur twice daily, without hema- tochezia or melena. One week after discharge, the patient\u2019s primary care physician prescribed omeprazole. The patient lost an additional 14 kg. Approximately 3 weeks later, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evalu- ation.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for depression, lumbar pain, and vitamin D defi- ciency. Intermittent diffuse headache persisted in the 3 weeks after discharge from the other hospital, and the patient reported low-grade fe- ver. A review of systems was negative for night sweats, chills, neck pain, photophobia, vision changes, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, coryza, sore throat, oral ulcers, back pain, dysuria, hema- turia, rashes, joint or muscle pain, edema, and pruritus. Medications included venlafaxine, cho- lecalciferol, and omeprazole. The patient took an herbal supplement of unknown type in the week after discharge from the other hospital. He had never used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. He had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient grew up on an island in the Caribbean and had immigrated to the United States 10 years earlier; he had last returned to the Caribbean 4 months before admission. He had traveled extensively in the northeastern and Mountain West regions of the United States. He was married with one child but had no known sick contacts. He drank one beer per day and had never smoked cigarettes; he occasionally smoked marijuana. There was no family history of  gastrointestinal  infections,  gastrointestinal cancers (his mother had ovarian cancer), peptic- ulcer disease, pancreatitis, irritable bowel syn- drome, inflammatory bowel disease, autoim- mune conditions, or malabsorption syndromes. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the heart rate\n107 beats per minute, the blood pressure 101/57 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.6. Examination was notable for cachexia. The  abdomen was soft and nondistended, with no or- ganomegaly. There was mild epigastric tender- ness, without rebound or guarding. No rashes, skin ulcerations, or lymphadenopathy were noted. The remainder of the examination was normal. The international normalized ratio and blood levels of magnesium, phosphorus, lipase, vita- min B12, folate, globulin, and IgA were normal, as were the results of a urinalysis; other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. An elec- trocardiogram showed right bundle-branch block, with no evidence of ischemia.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: A CT scan of the abdo- men and pelvis (Fig. 1), obtained after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, showed diffuse mild distention of the large and small bowel without a transition point to indi- cate a bowel obstruction. The presence of dif- fuse mild thickening of the bowel wall, mural enhancement, and prominent mesenteric vessels suggested diffuse inflammation. Additional non- specific findings included a reduced number of jejunal folds and an increased number of ileal folds (collectively known as jejunoileal fold pat- tern reversal) as well as mesenteric lymphade- nopathy.\nDr. Chu: Normal saline was administered intravenously, and sucralfate and dicyclomine were given orally. The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nDiarrhea and abdominal pain persisted on the second hospital day. Tests for human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 antibod- ies and antigen, Treponema pallidum antibodies, Clostridium difficile antigen, and tissue transglu- taminase IgA were negative. Blood testing for Helicobacter pylori IgG was positive; however, a stool test for H. pylori antigen was negative.\n\nTable 1.

CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis.\nA coronal reformation image (Panel A) shows prominent air\u00adfilled and fluid\u00adfilled loops of small bowel throughout the abdomen with mural thickening and enhancement (arrows). The jejunum, located in the left upper quadrant, lacks typical mural folds. An axial image of the pelvis (Panel B) shows dilatation of the ileum, thickening of the ileal wall, and prominent mural folds (arrows). An axial image of the transverse colon (Panel C) shows mild thickening of the haustral folds (arrows). An axial image of the midabdomen (Panel D) shows engorged mesenteric vessels (yel\u00ad low dashed line) and a representative enlarged mesenteric lymph node (blue dashed line). This constellation of findings is compatible with diffuse enterocolonic inflammation.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Robert C. Lowe: This 44-year-old man presents with a subacute gastrointestinal illness that is characterized by epigastric pain, vomiting, diar- rhea, and progressive weight loss during a 6-month period, with an intercurrent episode of neutrocytic, culture-negative meningitis. Labora- tory findings are notable for marked hypoalbu- minemia, elevated levels of inflammatory mark- ers, an elevated fecal calprotectin level, and a fluctuating absolute eosinophil count that ap- proaches the threshold for eosinophilia (1500 cells per microliter) but does not reach it. CT shows only marked hyperemia of the small bowel and evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy. This case raises several diagnostic possibilities, includ- ing cancer, autoimmune disease, and infection.\n\nCancer\nAlthough cancer must be included in the differ- ential diagnosis, a malignant process seems unlikely, given the diffuse nature of the intestinal abnormality seen on CT imaging; nevertheless, we need to consider the possibility of lympho- ma. The gastrointestinal tract is the most com- mon extranodal site of lymphoma. In the United States, up to 75% of cases of gastrointestinal lymphoma involve the stomach, whereas less than 10% involve the small bowel. However, in the Middle East and the Mediterranean, primary small-bowel lymphoma accounts for most cases. This patient has evidence of H. pylori infection, which may contribute to lymphoma involving the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the stom- ach. The Mediterranean variety of small-bowel lymphoma, known as immunoproliferative small intestinal disease, may be manifested by ab- dominal pain, diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss. The other small-bowel lymphomas include enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (associated with celiac disease), Burkitt\u2019s lym- phoma, and B-cell lymphomas other than im- munoproliferative small intestinal disease.1 Most often, these tumors are associated with obstruc- tion, perforation, or hemorrhage, and although they can be associated with more subtle muco- sal disease, the extent of this patient\u2019s bowel abnormality makes these diagnoses unlikely. Lymphomas may also involve the meninges, but a neutrocytic meningitis that resolves after anti- biotic therapy is not a feature of lymphomatous meningitis.\nAutoimmune Disease\nCeliac disease, which can cause a subacute syn- drome of diarrhea and weight loss as well as hypoalbuminemia and evidence of mucosal hy- peremia on imaging, is a consideration in this case. This patient had a negative tissue transglu- taminase IgA test, but the total IgA level is not reported. When considering celiac disease, it is important to first rule out concomitant IgA de- ficiency. If the total IgA level is low, a tissue transglutaminase IgG test should be performed. However, in this case, the evidence of mesen- teric lymphadenopathy that was seen on CT and the episode of meningitis are not characteristic of celiac disease. Although celiac disease may have neurologic manifestations, including seizures, neuropathy, ataxia, and cognitive slowing, it is not manifested by meningeal symptoms.2\nAutoimmune enteropathy is a rare disorder\nthat can lead to subacute diarrhea and weight loss. It is characterized by a lymphocytic im- mune reaction that causes enterocyte destruc- tion and intestinal villous blunting that can mimic severe celiac disease. The presence of antienterocyte or anti\u2013goblet-cell antibodies is suggestive of this disorder, and intestinal biop- sies typically show villous blunting and evidence of lymphocytosis in the intestinal crypts. Auto- immune enteropathy has been associated with\n \nseveral extraintestinal manifestations, but neuro- logic syndromes have not been described.3\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis is a rare inflam- matory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract in which eosinophilic infiltration of the mucosa of the stomach and small bowel leads to abdomi- nal pain, nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, with weight loss occurring in a minority of pa- tients. In some cases, the muscular layers of the gastrointestinal tract are involved, leading to gut dysmotility and obstructive symptoms. Serosal disease manifesting as ascites may also occur. Peripheral eosinophilia occurs in up to 80% of patients with eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and imaging studies may show wall thickening of the gastric antrum and small bowel. The diag- nosis of this condition is made by examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens, which show eosinophilic infiltration of the gut wall.4 This patient does not have persistent absolute eosino- philia, which makes this diagnosis unlikely.\nInfection\nMany HIV-associated infections can cause a pro- longed diarrheal syndrome with weight loss, and the presence of diffuse bowel abnormality and mesenteric lymphadenopathy on CT imaging in this patient is consistent with Mycobacterium avium complex infection. However, this patient\u2019s HIV screening test was negative, which rules out opportunistic infections resulting from advanced HIV infection.\nI would be remiss if I did not raise the pos- sibility of Whipple\u2019s disease in this case. Whip- ple\u2019s disease may be manifested by a subacute wasting illness. Infection with Tropheryma whip- plei leads to infiltration of foamy macrophages into the small bowel, which results in a syn- drome of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and malab- sorption that is typically accompanied by joint pain. Other extraintestinal features include fever, lymphadenopathy, and central nervous system abnormalities, such as dementia, cerebellar atax- ia, and in rare cases, oculomasticatory myorhyth- mia. Central nervous system involvement may be manifested by mild lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF with an elevated total protein level. The diagnosis of Whipple\u2019s disease can be made by periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining of a small-bowel biopsy specimen, which would show foamy mac- rophages in the lamina propria of the gut. The organism can be identified on electron microscopy of biopsy specimens or with PCR testing of biopsy specimens or peripheral blood.5 The ab- sence of joint symptoms and the occurrence of an acute episode of neutrocytic meningitis are atypical for this rare disease, making it an un- likely diagnosis in this case.\nTropical sprue should always be considered in patients from the Caribbean who present with a wasting diarrheal illness. This disorder is thought to be due to an uncharacterized intestinal infec- tion that leads to persistent small-bowel muco- sal damage. Patients may have severe hypoalbu- minemia as well as diffuse bowel-wall edema similar to that seen on this patient\u2019s imaging studies. However, this patient has mesenteric lymphadenopathy, which is not a characteristic of tropical sprue. Patients with tropical sprue typically have megaloblastic anemia, which re- sults from both folate deficiency and vitamin B12\ndeficiency, and neutrocytic meningitis is not a\nfeature of this disorder. Treatment of tropical sprue includes folate repletion and a prolonged course of tetracycline.6\nIn a patient who is from a tropical region of the world and has persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, parasitic infestation should also be considered. A common parasitic infection that seems to fit with this patient\u2019s presentation is strongyloidiasis with an associated hyperinfec- tion syndrome. Strongyloides stercoralis is a nema- tode that is endemic in large parts of the tropics and subtropics. Infection begins with inocula- tion of the skin with filariform larvae that reside in the soil. The larvae migrate through the skin into the bloodstream, which carries them to the lungs. The organisms then penetrate the alveolar wall and ascend the bronchi and trachea until they reach the pharynx, where they are swal- lowed and subsequently come to rest in the proxi- mal small bowel. The larvae mature into adult worms that inhabit the mucosa of the gut, where they shed eggs that hatch into rhabditiform lar- vae that are eventually excreted in the stool.\nA well-known characteristic of strongyloides\nis that it can complete its life cycle within the human host. In this autoinfection cycle, the rhabditiform larvae mature into invasive filari- form larvae in the small bowel and colon and then burrow through the bowel wall or perianal skin to restart the life cycle within the same host. In this way, the infection can last for de-\n \n\ncades after the patient has left the region where the organism is endemic.7\nThere are several gastrointestinal manifesta- tions of strongyloidiasis, including epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, features that mimic peptic-ulcer disease. Watery diarrhea is a com- mon manifestation that may be accompanied by frank malabsorption of fat and vitamin B12.\nMalabsorption syndrome can mimic celiac dis-\nease or tropical sprue and may manifest as a protein-losing enteropathy, characterized by hypo- albuminemia and peripheral edema.\nHyperinfection syndrome is associated with a greatly increased worm burden, which often oc- curs in the context of immunosuppression or human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. The nematode becomes more invasive, penetrating the bowel mucosa and causing watery or bloody stools and severe abdominal pain. The worms often carry bowel flora, typically gram- negative bacteria, through the intestinal wall, leading to episodes of bacteremia or meningitis. Although a bacterial cause can be identified in most cases of meningitis, neutrocytic, culture- negative meningitis has been described in asso- ciation with strongyloidiasis.8\nThis patient is from a region in which strongy-\nloides is endemic, and he has a subacute wasting illness with abdominal pain, diarrhea, hypoalbu- minemia, and evidence of a diffuse small-bowel abnormality on imaging. He has mild intermit- tent eosinophilia and had an episode of apparent bacterial meningitis that responded to antibiotic therapy. His transient episodes of hemoptysis are consistent with the pulmonary phase of auto- infection; although the chest CT report does not support this hypothesis, the eosinophilic infil- trates associated with strongyloidiasis (known as the L\u00f6ffler syndrome) may be transient. All the features of this patient\u2019s presentation are consistent with strongyloidiasis with hyperinfec- tion syndrome. Although the patient is not known to be immunosuppressed, he may have acquired HTLV-1 infection, which would contrib- ute to the hyperinfection cascade. To establish this diagnosis, I would begin his workup with a stool examination for rhabditiform larvae; if the examination is negative, I would perform esoph- agogastroduodenoscopy as well as a duodenal biopsy to look for mucosal infestation with this parasite.\n\n\n",

To assess for these conditions, we performed upper and lower endoscopy (Fig. 2). On the upper endoscopy, diffuse edema and subepithelial hemorrhages were noted through- out the stomach (Fig. 2A) and duodenum (Fig. 2B), and diffuse edema and small erosions were present throughout the colon (Fig. 2C). The terminal ileum (Fig. 2D) had a notable loss of villi. We obtained biopsy specimens throughout the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.\nDr. John A. Branda: Histologic examination of the biopsy specimens of the gastrointestinal mucosa revealed moderately active gastritis, duodenitis, il- eitis, and colitis, along with abundant nematodes and ova diagnostic of strongyloidiasis (Fig. 3). A stool examination for ova and parasites was also positive for a moderate amount of S. stercoralis rhabditiform larvae (Fig. 4). Separately, a blood enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 IgG was reactive, and an immunoas- say for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 showed seroreactiv- ity with a band pattern that met the criteria for HTLV-1 infection. Thus, the final diagnosis was strongyloidiasis with HTLV-1 coinfection.",
