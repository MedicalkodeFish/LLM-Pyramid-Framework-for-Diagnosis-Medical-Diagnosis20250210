    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Anna C. O\u2019Kelly (Medicine): A 35-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of lymphadenopathy and thrombocytopenia.\nThe patient had been well until 4 months before this admission, when painless swelling developed in the groin area bilaterally; there were no other symptoms. Three months before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the primary care clinic of this hospital. He had multiple enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, which were mobile and nontender on palpation; the largest was 3 cm in diameter. The white- cell count was 5460 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), the platelet count 168,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000), and the hemo- globin level 11.4 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5). An interferon-\u03b3\u2013 release assay (IGRA) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative, as was screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and HIV type 1 and type 2 antibodies. The patient was referred for a lymph-node biopsy but chose not to pursue it.\nThree weeks before this admission, the patient was again evaluated in the pri-\nmary care clinic of this hospital. The size of the enlarged lymph nodes had not changed, and there were no new symptoms. He was again referred for a biopsy.\nDr. Melissa Krystel-Whittemore: Three days later, a core-needle biopsy of a left in- guinal lymph node was performed. Pathological examination of the biopsy speci- men (Fig. 1) revealed necrotic tissue with fibrosis and lymphohistiocytic inflam- mation; no definitive lymph-node tissue was present. Staining for acid-fast bacilli, Brown\u2013Hopps staining, and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver staining were negative. No malignant cells were identified.\nDr. O\u2019Kelly: Three days before the current admission, a nosebleed developed and resolved spontaneously. The morning of admission, a petechial rash developed on both legs, and the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported 3 months of nonproductive cough that had been attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had no fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, dyspnea, headache, or palpable masses other than the inguinal lymphadenopathy. He had a history of \u03b2-thalassemia trait and deficiencies of vitamin B12 and folate. For the past 15 years, a chronic pruritic rash on the thighs had occurred intermittently. Two months before this admission, he had received a diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection and had been treated with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and omepra- zole. Current medications included cyanocobala- min, folate, albuterol, f luticasone nasal spray, and clotrimazole cream. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient worked as a scientist and his research involved mice, but he had no pets. He was married and monogamous with his wife. Eleven years earlier, the patient had moved to an urban area of New England from northeast India, where he was born. He had last traveled to India 6 years earlier; family members had visited 4 years ear- lier. The patient had also traveled throughout all regions of the United States during the past 11 years. He drank one alcoholic beverage weekly and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. The patient\u2019s mother had hypertension, and his father had died from valvular heart disease. One of his sisters had received treatment for pulmo- nary tuberculosis 1 year earlier, and a second sister had latent tuberculosis; a third sister had diabetes.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.2\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 127/79 mm Hg, the pulse 82 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.4. He appeared well. Purpura, including a hemorrhagic blister 1 cm in diameter, was noted in the oral mucosa. There were diffuse petechiae on the legs and some petechiae on the torso, flanks, and forearms. There were enlarged, nontender inguinal lymph nodes,  which were  nonmobile and up to 4 cm in diameter on the left side and were mobile on the right side; no other palpable lymphadenopathy was noted.\nThe platelet count was 0 per microliter (refer- ence range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver- and renal-function tests and urinalysis. Screening for HIV and hepatitis C virus was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Examination of a peripheral- blood smear showed very few platelets and no platelet clumps. There were target red cells and elliptocytes; the morphologic features of the lymphocytes were normal.\nDr. Allen P. Heeger: Ultrasonography of the pal- pable abnormality in the left groin (Fig. 2A) re- vealed a well-circumscribed mass superficial to the iliac vessels, with a thick hyperemic rind and central necrosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 2B, 2C, and 2D), performed after the intravenous administra- tion of contrast material, revealed a conglomer- ate lymph-node mass, measuring 4.0 cm by 2.1 cm by 3.1 cm, in the superficial left inguinal region,with peripheral enhancement and central hypo- density. There were similar-appearing lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and the left iliac chain. There was also mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, with lymph nodes mea- suring up to 1.4 cm in diameter, as well as a small lymph node in the right minor fissure. The spleen measured 13.5 cm in length (refer- ence range, <12.2 cm). Positron-emission tomog- raphy (PET) from the skull base to the thighs (Fig. 2E and 2F), performed after the adminis- tration of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed extensive areas of intense FDG uptake in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as physiologic uptake in the pharyngeal and man- dibular areas.\nDr. O\u2019Kelly: Prednisone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. On the second hospital day, prednisone was stopped and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was admin- istered. During the next 3 days, the platelet count increased and the petechiae abated. On the sixth hospital day, the platelet count was 83 per microliter.\n\nFigure 1. Biopsy Specimen of Left Inguinal Lymph Node.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimen is shown at low magnification (Panel A) and at high magni- fication (Panels B, C, and D). The specimen shows extensive necrosis (Panel B, arrow) with some inflammatory cells; giant cells of Langerhans type (Panel C, arrows) adjacent to histiocytes and necrosis; and lymphohistiocytic inflam- mation (Panel D), with no evidence of lymphoma or other cancers.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Philippe Armand: This 35-year-old man initially presented with bilateral inguinal lymphadenopa- thy and no other symptoms. Four months later, he was admitted to this hospital with persistent inguinal lymphadenopathy and severe thrombo- cytopenia, having in the interim undergone a core- needle biopsy that was nondiagnostic. Although the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy is very broad, the causes of thrombocytopenia are more limited. Following the chronology of this case, we will first consider the possible causes of lymphadenopathy at the time of the patient\u2019s initial presentation. We can then narrow the dif- ferential diagnosis by factoring in the superim- posed thrombocytopenia that was identified dur- ing his subsequent presentation. Finally, we can use the information available from the lymph- node biopsy to further narrow our differential diagnosis.\nLymphadenopathy\nAbnormal enlargement of lymph nodes can re- sult from many processes, which range from benign to cancerous and from indolent to aggressive. A typical approach to determining the cause of lymphadenopathy in adults is to con- sider the location, extent (localized or generalized), and lymph-node characteristics, including size, tenderness, firmness, and fixation to un- derlying tissues. Although the lymph-node characteristics observed on examination may alter the likelihood of cancer, these findings rarely provide enough information to establish an ac- curate diagnosis. For example, lymphadenopathy that is generalized may appear to be localized, since some enlarged lymph nodes may not be detected on physical examination. Therefore, an accurate assessment of the extent of lymphade- nopathy requires cross-sectional imaging from the neck to the pelvis, which may not be neces- sary or practical for every patient with lymph- adenopathy. Even if one makes a correct diagno- sis, there is a risk of missing the underlying process or an important superimposed process; indeed, many entities that cause lymphadenopa- thy (e.g., HIV infection, some connective-tissue diseases, and immunodeficiency syndromes) also increase the risk that other causes of lymphade- nopathy (e.g., lymphoma) will be present.\nInstead, it may be helpful to consider that\nmany causes of lymphadenopathy, including some life-threatening ones (cancer) and some esoteric ones (e.g., Kikuchi\u2013Fujimoto disease), can be diagnosed only with a biopsy of an involved lymph node. Diseases that can be diagnosed only with a biopsy encompass a wide range of presentations, which overlaps with the presenta- tions of diseases that can be diagnosed without a biopsy (e.g., infections and connective-tissue diseases). Therefore, an alternative approach would be to first consider the reasons not to pursue a lymph-node biopsy in a patient present- ing with lymphadenopathy.\nIn many cases, the cause of lymphadenopathy\nis apparent from the clinical context and can be confirmed by results of noninvasive testing or by a response to empirical treatment, and thus a biopsy is unnecessary. To maximize the likeli- hood of making a diagnosis noninvasively, it is important to obtain a complete history \u2014 in- cluding information about the pace of lymph- node enlargement (although in my experience this is often hard for patients to accurately re- call), travel and animal exposures, and risk fac- tors for infections such as HIV infection and tuberculosis \u2014 and to perform a physical ex- amination to determine the location and charac- teristics of the abnormal nodes.1 The location may provide an important clue to the underlying diagnosis after consideration of normal lymphatic drainage patterns (e.g., axillary lymphadenopa- thy could suggest an arm infection or inguinal lymphadenopathy could suggest a sexually trans- mitted illness). Several infections that can be diagnosed noninvasively should at least be con- sidered, because they are common, treatable, life-threatening, or of high public health impor- tance. These include infectious mononucleosis, Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV infection, bubonic plague, anthrax, and tularemia. Finally, it is worth remembering that certain medications can be associated with lymphadenopathy,2 often in the context of drug-induced hypersensitivity syn- drome, and presumptive identification and with- drawal of an offending agent is essential.3\nIn other cases, the cause of lymphadenopathy\nis not readily apparent but the patient is asymp- tomatic and the lymph-node characteristics are consistent with a benign process (in which the nodes are typically small and mobile, although even small nodes may be cancerous2). In this situation, a \u201cwatch and wait\u201d strategy is reason- able if adequate follow-up after 2 to 4 weeks is ensured. In my opinion, it is not advisable to prescribe an empirical course of antibiotics for such patients unless the treatment is clearly tar- geting a suspected infection that is consistent with the clinical presentation (e.g., in patients with cat scratch disease).\nIn general, routine testing, such as testing for\nantinuclear antibodies or thyrotropin, is unlikely to be helpful in determining the cause of lymphadenopathy in the absence of a suspicion grounded in the clinical presentation. However, HIV testing should be performed.\nIn applying this approach to this patient, we can start by asking whether there was a clinically apparent diagnosis that could have been made noninvasively at the time of the initial presentation. The inguinal location of the lymphadenopathy raises the possibility of infec- tion or cancer arising from the legs, genital area, or anorectal area. However, the history and physical examination did not reveal evidence of or risk factors for such an illness. There was no history of an exposure that would suggest a sexually transmitted infection; furthermore, sexually transmitted infections that can cause inguinal lymphadenopathy (lymphogranuloma venereum, chancroid, or herpes simplex virus infection) are typically associated with charac- teristic cutaneous genital findings that were absent in this case. Syphilis still warrants con- sideration, since it can cause painless bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy and the initial chancre can go unnoticed. Therefore, this patient\u2019s initial presentation could be consistent with primary syphilis.4 Beyond that possibility, there is no readily apparent diagnosis. Given the absence of other symptoms or findings on examination, a few weeks of observation was a reasonable ap- proach at that time.\nWhen the patient presented several months later, the situation had changed. The persistent lymphadenopathy was generalized (on the basis of results of CT and PET imaging) and was as- sociated with severe thrombocytopenia. Obser- vation was certainly no longer an option. The differential diagnosis of generalized lymphade- nopathy is even broader than that of localized lymphadenopathy, and there are few other clues to the diagnosis, except for thrombocytopenia. Therefore, the next step is to consider how the presence of thrombocytopenia may narrow the differential diagnosis.\n\nThrombocytopenia\nThe differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia includes pseudothrombocytopenia; decreased pro- duction of platelets, which is most often due to infection, cancer, or drug use; consumption of platelets due to microangiopathic hemolytic ane- mia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or hemo- phagocytic syndrome; increased destruction of platelets due to an immune or mechanical cause or drug use; splenic sequestration; pregnancy; dilutional thrombocytopenia; and congenital thrombocytopenia. A review of the complete blood count and a peripheral-blood smear, pregnancy testing (if appropriate), an assessment of spleen size, and a careful review of medications and supplements will usually lead to identifica- tion of the relevant pathophysiological category, narrowing the differential diagnosis.\nIn this case, the blood counts other than the platelet count were nearly normal and the mor- phologic features of the cells were unremark- able, except for abnormalities that were readily explained by the patient\u2019s known \u03b2-thalassemia trait. The spleen was slightly enlarged, but this would not explain a platelet count of 0 per micro- liter. Therefore, this patient had \u201chematologi- cally isolated\u201d severe thrombocytopenia, which suggests either a drug-related process or immune thrombocytopenia. In the absence of an appar- ent culprit medication, the patient\u2019s thrombocyto- penia is most likely immune thrombocytopenia.\n\nImmune Thrombocytopenia\nImmune thrombocytopenia has its own differ- ential diagnosis, with the most common triggers being idiopathic disease, infections (e.g., infec- tion with HIV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovi- rus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, hepatitis C virus, or\nH.\tpylori), autoimmune diseases, lymphoid can- cers, immunodeficiency syndromes, and thyroid disorders. In comparing this list with the one for generalized lymphadenopathy, we can narrow the differential diagnosis considerably. HIV infection and hepatitis C were ruled out by means of labo- ratory testing, and other infections associated with immune thrombocytopenia would not be expected to cause 4 months of asymptomatic lymphadenopathy. There is no evidence of an autoimmune disease or thyroid disorder and no history of immunodeficiency, which leaves lym- phoid cancer as a possible diagnosis. Many such cancers can be associated with immune throm- bocytopenia, and some \u2014 especially indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \u2014 could have an indolent course for several months.\nBiopsy Findings\nIn this case, a lymph-node biopsy was per- formed before admission. Although the results were not diagnostic, they were very informative, with the biopsy specimens showing evidence of prominent necrosis and lymphohistiocytic pro- liferation (Fig. 1). The imaging studies also showed findings consistent with substantial necrosis of the lymph nodes. The amount of necrosis observed on biopsy and imaging would not be consistent with indolent non-Hodgkin\u2019s or Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and is more suggestive of an infection or a histiocytic disorder, including idiopathic disorders such as Kikuchi\u2013Fujimoto disease. Unfortunately, this complicates our dif- ferential diagnosis, since these disorders are not typically associated with immune thrombocyto- penia.\nSince focusing on the combination of gener- alized lymphadenopathy, immune thrombocyto- penia, and intense lymph-node necrosis did not readily yield a diagnosis, we will instead focus on the combination of lymphadenopathy and prominent necrosis, leaving aside the immune thrombocytopenia for now. We can further nar- row the differential diagnosis by considering only entities that could manifest as lymphade- nopathy for 4 months without any other symp- toms. The remaining list includes infections (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and non- tuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis) and Kikuchi\u2013Fujimoto disease. Cancers with promi- nent histiocytosis, such as histiocytic sarcoma and Langerhans-cell histiocytosis, rarely mani- fest as isolated lymphadenopathy. If isolated lymphadenopathy occurs in Langerhans-cell his- tiocytosis, it typically involves the cervical area; furthermore, histiocytic sarcoma is an aggres- sive cancer, which would not be consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation.\nNone of the remaining entities in the differential diagnosis are typically associated with immune thrombocytopenia, but most can be. More- over, immune thrombocytopenia can be idiopathic. Although we have already raised the possibility of syphilis, it is notable that the patient reported no new sexual exposures, primary syphilis typi- cally would not persist for 4 months, and gener- alized lymphadenopathy would be more consis- tent with secondary syphilis, which would be associated with additional clinical manifestations. Therefore, syphilis remains possible but is an unlikely diagnosis in this case. The patient did not have any exposures that would suggest toxo- plasmosis, and inguinal involvement would be unusual for this disease. Kikuchi\u2013Fujimoto dis- ease is rarely asymptomatic and usually has cervi- cal involvement. Nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis typically affects younger patients and rarely causes inguinal or generalized lymph- adenopathy.\nTuberculosis\nAlthough this patient had epidemiologic risk factors for tuberculosis, he had a negative IGRA, which argues against this diagnosis. This test is not ideally suited for the diagnosis of active tu- berculosis, but it has a sensitivity of approxi- mately 90% and a specificity of 80% for the di- agnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis,5 and thus the negative IGRA in this case decreases the pretest probability of tuberculosis by a factor of approximately six. The absence of acid-fast bacilli on staining of the lymph-node\u2013biopsy specimen further decreases the probability. How- ever, this patient was originally from India, where\nM. tuberculosis is endemic, and he had direct per-\nsonal exposure to tuberculosis. His clinical pre- sentation would be a good fit with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, as would the appearance of the lymphadenopathy on imaging and biopsy. Im- mune thrombocytopenia has only rarely been described with tuberculosis, but this is true of all the diagnoses that are consistent with the patient\u2019s clinical presentation and with promi- nent necrosis on pathological examination. There- fore, despite the negative IGRA and staining for acid-fast bacilli, I think the most likely diagnosis in this patient is tuberculous lymphadenitis. To confirm this diagnosis, I would recommend an excisional lymph-node biopsy, which would be the next step in the evaluation of this patient\u2019s undiagnosed lymphadenopathy.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Krystel-Whittemore: Excision of the left inguinal lymph node was performed. On gross examination, the lymph node measured 4.5 cm by 3.4 cm by 2.4 cm and was surrounded by fibro- fatty tissue. Sectioning of the lymph node re- vealed tan, nodular cut surfaces measuring up to 1.2 cm in greatest dimension, with areas of white material. On microscopic examination, the lymph-node architecture was distorted by numerous granulomas with abundant necrosis, which corresponded to the white material seen on gross examination (Fig. 3). There were coalescent granulomas with large areas of necrosis and focal neutrophilic microabscesses, with some  granulomas infiltrating overlying  subcutaneous tissue. Adjacent areas showed follicular hyperplasia, capsular fibrosis, and scattered paracortical immunoblasts. No Reed\u2013Sternberg cells or other evidence of lymphoma or other can- cers were detected. Staining for acid-fast bacilli showed occasional organisms. Fite staining and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver staining were negative.\nFurther studies were performed to identify the acid-fast organisms. Examination of a lymph node smear for acid-fast bacilli was negative, which is not surprising, because this method can detect only a high concentration of organ- isms, whereas culture can detect a much lower concentration. On the 23rd day of incubation in liquid broth, mycobacterial growth was detected. On examination of a new smear made directly from the liquid broth, the organism showed cording, a morphologic feature consistent with M. tuberculosis. Ultimately, a DNA probe of the organism identified M. tuberculosis, and the final diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis was established.\n",
