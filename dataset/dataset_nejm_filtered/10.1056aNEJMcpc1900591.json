    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Christopher M. Kearney (Medicine): A 54-year-old man was evaluated for acute altered mental status after being hospitalized for alcohol withdrawal.\nThe patient was homeless but had recently been enrolled in an addiction treat- ment program in a residential clinical stabilization service. He reportedly left the program 4 days before admission to this hospital and then \u201cblacked out\u201d daily in tandem with drinking 0.5 to 1 gallon of vodka throughout the day. On the evening before admission, he decided to stop drinking alcohol. Approximately 10 hours later, he awoke on the ground without recollection of lying down; he had had vivid dreams and tremulousness and was worried that he may have had a seizure. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital.\nThe patient reported diffuse headache, nausea, nonbloody and nonbilious emesis, restlessness, auditory hallucinations, and a sensation of insects crawling on the skin. A review of systems was notable for heartburn and was negative for confu- sion, ataxia, dizziness, focal weakness and numbness, tongue laceration, inconti- nence, visual hallucinations, fever, chills, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dysuria. His medical history was notable for seizure disorder in childhood, hypertension, and glaucoma, and he had undergone umbilical hernia repair. He reported that he was taking gabapentin and hydroxyzine and had no adverse drug reactions. The patient had a lengthy history of alcohol use, with associ- ated delirium tremens and withdrawal seizures, although he had abstained from alcohol use over a 7-year period, which coincided with incarceration and ended 8 years before admission. He smoked cigarettes and had smoked 0.5 to 1 pack daily since he was 18 years of age. He had previously used marijuana, hash oil, and lysergic acid diethylamide. His family history was notable for alcohol use disorder in his parents and two brothers.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 108 beats per min-\nute, the blood pressure 161/96 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 55.4 kg, the height 142 cm, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.5. The patient was described as restless, anxious, and f lushed. Tongue fasciculations and mild arm tremors were present. There was no tenderness on the head, face, or spine. Auscultation revealed a tachycardic rhythm and scattered wheezes. There were reducible ventral and umbilical hernias, with a well-healed umbilical scar. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nLevels of globulin and thyrotropin were nor- mal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy urine with trace ketones but was otherwise normal. Samples of the blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram was notable for sinus tachycardia and borderline left atrial en- largement. A chest radiograph was normal, and a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the head, obtained without the administration of contrast material, showed no intracranial hemorrhage, mass, or stroke.\nFolate, multivitamins, intravenous normal saline, thiamine, and lorazepam were adminis- tered during the next 10 hours. Additional labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nPhenobarbital was administered at a gradually tapering dose for management of alcohol with- drawal. The patient was evaluated by the addic- tion consultation service; he reported ongoing alcohol cravings, for which topiramate was rec- ommended. Tremors, hallucinosis, and tachycar- dia all abated with phenobarbital treatment, but cravings persisted. He awaited transfer to an alcohol detoxification facility.\nOn hospital day 5, the patient reported feeling anxious. That evening, a nurse found him to be acutely delirious, lethargic, and minimally re- sponsive, even to sternal rub, just 1 hour after he had been awake and conversing; he had not left his room. A fingerstick glucose measurement was 151 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). Examination revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 beats per minute (as compared with 78 beats per minute 6 hours previously), tachy- pnea with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, an oxygen saturation of 95% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and new abdominal distention without tenderness; he had no tremors, seizure, incontinence, or tongue trauma. Naloxone was administered but had no effect. An electro- cardiogram showed sinus tachycardia. Results of repeat laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was again normal. A chest radiograph was normal, as was a CT scan of the head that was obtained without the administration of con- trast material.\nThe neurology service evaluated the patient.\nThe next morning, the patient was more awake, alert to person and place, and responsive to com- mands. An electroencephalogram showed generalized theta slowing, without epileptiform ab- normalities. Later in the day, he was lethargic. He reported heartburn and nausea and vomited dark-brown material. Examination revealed ab- dominal distention and guaiac-positive, black stool. Laboratory test results are shown in Ta- ble 1. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Amirkasra Mojtahed: A CT scan of the abdo- men and pelvis (Fig. 1), obtained after the ad- ministration of oral and intravenous contrast material, showed multiple dilated small-bowel loops, with an associated segment of small-bowel wall thickening, but no changes consistent with bowel obstruction.\nDr. Kearney: The surgery service evaluated the patient. A nasogastric tube was placed, with im- mediate return of 400 ml of dark-brown and \u201ccoffee grounds\u201d material. Intravenous normal saline, vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole were administered.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Andrew Z. Fenves: This 54-year-old man with a history of alcohol use disorder was admitted to the hospital with concerns about alcohol with- drawal symptoms. He had recent binges in which he consumed large amounts of vodka, but he did not report consuming toxic fluids, such as meth- anol or ethylene glycol. He had nausea, vomit- ing, headaches, auditory hallucinations, heart- burn, and formication. On physical examination, he was tremulous and had a body-mass index of 27.5, with an estimated total body water of 33 liters.\nThe patient had hypertension, tachypnea,\ntachycardia, and tongue fasciculations, and he was flushed. His blood alcohol level was 136 mg per deciliter, even though he had stopped drinking 10 hours earlier. Assuming an alcohol metabolic rate of 20 mg per deciliter per hour, I estimate that his peak blood alcohol level was approxi- mately 336 mg per deciliter, a level high enough to cause stupor in a relatively small person. He had an anion gap of 21 mmol per liter (normal range, 7 to 13), a serum bicarbonate level of 19 mmol per liter, and a normal serum albumin level, of 4.1 g per deciliter. The serum lactate level was elevated, at 5.1 mmol per liter (45.9 mg per deciliter; normal range, 0.5 to 2.2 mmol per liter [4.5 to 19.8 mg per deciliter]); the serum beta-hydroxybutyrate level was also elevated, and there were ketones in the urine.\nI can state with confidence that the patient\u2019s diagnosis on admission was alcohol intoxication with early signs of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition, he had anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to both lactic acidosis and alcoholic ketoaci- dosis. I should note that his anion gap decreased with therapy and was nearly normal (14 mmol per liter) by the morning of hospital day 5.\nWhat caused this patient\u2019s acute mental-status change on hospital day 5? He had appeared to be recovering appropriately from alcohol intoxica- tion. I should note the following key features of that day. He was anxious but fully alert in the morning, but he became tachycardic, tachypneic, and minimally responsive in the evening, within 1 hour after he had been seen and had appeared to be well. He had not left his room. He eventu- ally vomited and had upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Laboratory findings were notable for new anion-gap metabolic acidosis (anion gap, 20 mmol per liter), with an only minimally ele- vated serum lactate level. His urine was positive for ketones again; his arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.40, with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 32 mm Hg. In my interpretation, his acid\u2013base status at this point indicated a mixed disturbance: anion-gap metabolic acidosis of an uncertain cause and metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting, with appropriate respiratory compen- sation.\n\nAcute Mental-Status Changes during Hospitalization\nTo narrow the differential diagnosis, I will first discuss the acute decline in mental status that occurred while this patient was in the hospital. Numerous metabolic disturbances can develop rapidly and cause an acute change in mental status in a hospital setting. These include hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, hyponatremia or hypernatremia, and hypercalcemia. The labora- tory values associated with these conditions were normal in this patient. The arterial blood gas analysis ruled out both hypoxemia and hy- percarbia. His blood ammonia level was not ele- vated. There was no evidence of cardiogenic shock or septic shock, and an indolent infection would be unlikely to cause such a severe and sudden change in mental status. A large acute pulmonary embolus would be unlikely in the absence of chest pain, hypoxemia, or hemody- namic compromise. There was no evidence of seizure or a postictal state. A CT scan of the head was obtained to look for evidence of a new anatomical event in the central nervous system, such as stroke or hemorrhage, but none was present. Naloxone was administered in case of an opiate overdose but had no effect. By exclu- sion, we are left with the possibility of a drug or toxin ingestion by the patient while he was still on the hospital ward.\nAnion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis\nNext, I will concentrate on the presence of new anion-gap metabolic acidosis, as well as ketones in the urine, a mild increase in the serum creati- nine level with a normal blood urea nitrogen level, and the gradual improvement of the pa- tient\u2019s condition within 24 hours with conserva- tive measures, including the administration of intravenous fluids. This is a clinical situation in which calculating the anion gap is very useful in establishing the differential diagnosis.1 With the help of a few readily available laboratory tests, the cause of metabolic acidosis can be quickly established in most patients. The serum anion gap is typically calculated with the follow- ing formula, with the electrolytes measured in millimoles per liter: serum sodium \u2212 (serum chloride+ serum bicarbonate).\nThe normal range for the anion gap is 7 to 13 mmol per liter, although there may be some variation. It is important to note that the anion gap is an artificial measurement in the sense that the sum of the cations and the sum of the anions in human serum are equal. The anion gap is primarily a result of the major unmeasured anions, namely albumin, in the serum, which have a net negative charge in the physiologic pH range. There is a reduction in the serum anion gap of 2.3 to 2.5 mmol per liter for every reduc- tion in the serum albumin level of 1 g per deci- liter.2 This patient had a normal serum albumin level, so no further adjustments are needed in his elevated anion gap of 20 mmol per liter.\n\nInborn Errors of Metabolism\nMy approach to the presence of anion-gap meta- bolic acidosis is to consider five categories of clinical disorders. The first category includes several inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., propi- onic acidemia, fatty acid oxidation defects, and others). Virtually all these disorders are present at birth or are diagnosed in infancy and thus do not apply in this patient.\n\nLactic Acidosis\nThe second category is lactic acidosis. Standard hospital laboratories obtain measurements of l-lactate, which is the form of lactate that is produced by humans. In this patient, the l-lactate level became minimally elevated, to 2.4 mmol per liter (21.6 mg per deciliter); this degree of\n \n\nelevation is clearly not enough to explain the elevated anion gap. I considered the possibility of d-lactic acidosis because the patient received intramuscular phenobarbital \u2014 a preparation that can contain propylene glycol, which is me- tabolized into both the d-lactate and l-lactate stereoisomers. Cases of d-lactic acidosis can cause confusion, memory loss, and cerebellar ataxia.3 Measurement of the serum d-lactate level is not mentioned in this case. However, the patient received only a few doses of the intra- muscular preparation and none in the last 3 days of hospitalization, and these factors essentially rule out this diagnosis.\n\nKetoacidosis\nThe next category to consider is ketoacidosis, including alcoholic, diabetic, and starvation keto- acidosis. This patient\u2019s blood glucose level was only slightly elevated, he had a regular hospital diet, and his alcohol ingestion was now too dis- tant to invoke this diagnosis.\n\nRenal Failure\nThe fourth category to consider is renal failure in which metabolic acidosis results from retention of both hydrogen ions and anions, such as sul- fate, phosphate, and urate. The observed increase in the serum creatinine level did not indicate acute renal failure and thus would not explain the patient\u2019s substantially elevated anion gap.\n\nDrug or Toxin Ingestion\nWe are now left with the fifth category, which is drug or toxin ingestion. Although there is a long list of substances that could cause the patient\u2019s condition,4 we need to consider only the ones that he could have accessed while he was in the hospital.\nWithout leaving the hospital, the patient would not have had access to substances such as metha- nol and ethylene glycol. Chronic acetaminophen ingestion can cause 5-oxoproline acidosis in some circumstances,5 but acetaminophen was undetect- able in this patient, as was salicylate. However, he would have had access to isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol), because the hand sanitizer that is commonly used at this hospital contains 63% isopropanol. Ingestion of hand sanitizer would explain the ketones in the urine (since this alco- hol is metabolized to acetone) and the severely altered mental status but still may not immedi- ately explain the anion-gap metabolic acidosis. The hand sanitizer contains some lactate, which could play a small role in causing an elevated anion gap. In addition, there have been reports of false increases in the serum creatinine level with isopropanol intoxication,6,7 and this could explain the increase in the serum creatinine level with normal blood urea nitrogen level that was seen in this patient. Accordingly, ingestion of a large volume of hand sanitizer would be a unifying diagnosis of the altered mental status, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acetone in the urine, and a false increase in the serum creati- nine level.\nCould any other ingestions have caused the elevated anion gap in this patient? I wonder whether he may have ingested the mouthwash in his room. The mouthwash that is available to patients at this hospital contains benzoic acid, which is metabolized to hippuric acid and can cause anion-gap metabolic acidosis. This sub- stance would also be more palatable, since hand sanitizer would be rather viscous to drink. To establish the diagnosis of toxic alcohol ingestion, I would perform a blood volatile substances screening.",
