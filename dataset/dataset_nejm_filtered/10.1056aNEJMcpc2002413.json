    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Rachel M. Erdil (Medicine and Pediatrics): A 7-year-old girl who had immigrated to the United States from Central America was evaluated in the asylum clinic of this hospital \u2014 where forensic medical evaluations of asylum seekers are per- formed to document evidence of persecution \u2014 because of psychological distress after family separation while in U.S. immigration detention.\nSeven months before this evaluation, the patient and her mother fled their vil- lage in Central America because of physical and emotional abuse. They traveled by foot, motorcycle, bus, and truck for thousands of kilometers, with limited access to food, water, and other basic resources during their journey. They traveled with- out legal authorization; on one occasion, they hid in a farmhouse for several days to evade local authorities.\nSix months before this evaluation, the patient and her mother crossed the United States\u2013Mexico border. The mother reported that they had been surrounded by border patrol officers and instructed to relinquish personal belongings and remove pieces of clothing; these items were not returned. The patient and her mother were driven to a border detention facility in the Southwest region of the United States and were placed with approximately 40 other women and children in a room that was locked and guarded by male guards. The room had cement floors, a toilet shielded by a partial wall, and a mattress for every four people.\nAfter 2 days of detainment, the patient\u2019s mother was instructed to bathe the child, dress her in an oversized, unmarked uniform, and place her in a line of children approximately 5 to 12 years old. The children were led out of the room without their mothers and transported to a facility in another state. The patient and her mother were not informed of the destination or told when they would be able to communicate. The mother was told that she would be deported and would not see her child again.\nFive days later, the patient\u2019s mother was transported to a facility more than 1000 km away from the patient\u2019s new facility. After 15 days of separation, the patient and her mother communicated by tele- phone for the first time. During the next month, they talked approximately once per week.\nThe patient described that, while she was in the facility, she was bullied by other children. They called her names, insulted her, and stole a hat that she had made for her mother. A boy hit the patient in the face and loosened a tooth; an- other child kicked a ball toward her mouth and caused a nosebleed. The patient befriended a girl and cried for days when that girl was transported to another location without notice. When the pa- tient had a fever, cough, and conjunctivitis, she was held in isolation for an unknown amount of time; the symptoms resolved spontaneously. The patient felt uncomfortable with male staff mem- bers and requested that female staff members be assigned to care for her; she reported that this request had not been granted.\nFour months before this evaluation and ap-\nproximately 5 weeks after crossing the border, the patient\u2019s mother filed for asylum in the United States. She was released and traveled to New England, at which point she petitioned for the release of the patient. After 2 months of separa- tion, the patient was released and transported to New England to join her mother.\nDuring the evaluation in the asylum clinic, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the girl no longer had interest in activities that she had previously enjoyed. She had performed well in school but now had trouble focusing during class and had become afraid of other children, especially boys. She had begun to have aggres- sive behavior \u2014 such as throwing rocks at peo- ple, cursing, and frequently getting into fights with other children \u2014 along with food aversions; the patient now ate only soup from a cup and had no interest in foods she had previously enjoyed. The patient\u2019s mother also reported that the girl had anxiety, which was worse when she was separated from her mother. During these times, the patient had catastrophic thoughts, such as thoughts of her mother dying or being run over by a vehicle. She insisted that her mother walk her to the door of her school every day. At night, she could not fall asleep unless she was holding her mother\u2019s hand, and she had frequent nightmares.\nThe patient scratched and kicked during sleep and would awake suddenly, screaming and crying.\nThe patient had no history of illness and had met normal developmental milestones. She took no medications and had no known drug allergies. She lived with her mother in a suburban area of New England. In Central America, the patient had lived with her parents and grandparents. Her father drank alcohol and used illicit drugs.\nThe patient reported that, in Central America, \u201cbad people wanted to kill my mother.\u201d She was aware that her mother had been abducted at gun- point and held against her will for an extended period. She recalled a burglary of the family\u2019s home. The patient had also witnessed her father hitting her mother. She reported that she had heard her father tell her mother that he wished the mother would die. On multiple occasions, he had locked the patient and her mother inside their home for several days while he drank alco- hol or used drugs. The father had used a belt to strike the patient.\nThe patient was well developed and appropriately dressed. She was alert and cooperative but detached. Speech was spontaneous and fluent in Spanish. Mood and affect were normal initially but became more negative during the interview. She became visibly anxious when discussing her childhood in Central America and her detention in the Southwest.\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Matthew G. Gartland: This 7-year-old girl, who had been exposed to multiple traumatic events, presented with severe psychological distress after prolonged separation from her mother while in\nU.S. immigration detention. She had been referred by a lawyer to an asylum clinic for a forensic medical evaluation (sometimes called an \u201cFME\u201d) to document the psychological consequences of past trauma. The challenge of this evaluation is balancing the importance of gathering clinical information to inform the forensic assessment with the risk of retraumatization.\n\nForensic Medical Evaluation of Asylum Applicants\nIn this case, the purpose of the forensic medical evaluation was to document signs and symptoms of psychological distress resulting from traumatic events, including family separation in immigra- tion detention, to provide important context for the mother\u2019s asylum case. Asylum may be granted to a person who is unwilling to return to their country because of a well-founded fear of perse- cution based on race, religion, nationality, politi- cal opinion, or membership in a social group. Medical providers can be a resource for asylum applicants by conducting a forensic medical evaluation to assess the consistency of medical and psychological findings with the reported abuse (Fig. 1).1,2 Asylum is granted to 89% of applicants who undergo a forensic medical evalu- ation by a trained evaluator, as compared with 37.5% of applicants who do not undergo the evaluation.3\n\nTrauma-Informed Approach to Diagnosis in an Asylum Evaluation\nWhen the evaluators first met this patient, they used a trauma-informed approach to diagnosis, based on the principles of trauma-informed care (Table 1), to protect the well-being of the child during the evaluation while gathering the infor- mation necessary for a rigorous clinical assess- ment. Obtaining a history of trauma from a child can be difficult because the child may have feel- ings of guilt, shame, and avoidance.7 Develop- mental stage and limitations in memory and language may also hinder a child\u2019s ability to communicate details of past trauma and related symptoms.8 In addition, distressing memories and emotions are likely to resurface when the child describes the traumatic events.9 The evalu- ation of this patient highlights the tension between the importance of obtaining a comprehen- sive history to support a thorough assessment and the risk of triggering distress. In this case, the patient became anxious when speaking about past traumatic experiences. The role of the evaluator included monitoring the child\u2019s distress and providing a safe environment to mitigate the risk of harm.\nIntegrating Knowledge of Trauma into Practice\nIn an asylum evaluation, the evaluator\u2019s approach to the interview is just as important as the con- clusions of the assessment. The evaluator creates a child-friendly and collaborative environment. The use of open-ended questions may be more effective than closed or focused questions in eliciting an accurate history from children.10 Evidence-based forensic interview guides, trauma screening tools, and structured play may be help- ful in obtaining a comprehensive history.11,12 Dur- ing this evaluation, the patient\u2019s mother provided support and served as an additional source for history and observations of the child\u2019s behavior.13 This patient had a history of multiple trau- matic events that had put her at risk for trauma- related distress. While she was in her country of origin, she experienced and witnessed multiple episodes of domestic violence and was aware of threats to her mother outside the home. Re- peated violence and threat of harm forced the\nmother and child to flee.\nDuring their migration, the patient and her mother were faced with a scarcity of food and with other insecurity. In immigration detention, they were initially held together in crowded con- ditions and then separated for almost 2 months with minimal contact. Neither the mother nor the child knew whether they would be reunited. The patient lacked stable relationships and was bullied by other children and staff.\nUnfortunately, this patient\u2019s experiences are representative of the harmful conditions children have experienced in immigration detention around the country. Reports from several government agencies have documented poor access to medi- cal care, sleep deprivation due to constant expo- sure to light, a lack of adequate bedding, and numerous examples of inappropriate or punitive use of medical isolation.14-16 Even without an analysis of specific conditions, detention and family separation are known to be fundamen- tally injurious to a child\u2019s well-being and devel- opment, putting the patient at lifelong risk for physical and mental health consequences.17-20\nRecognizing Signs  and  Symptoms  of  Distress The presentation of trauma-related psychiatric disorders differs across developmental stages. Classification systems such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders have started to\nincorporate aspects of symptom expression across specific developmental stages; however, it re- mains difficult to recognize signs and symp- toms of traumatic stress in young children.21,22\nThis patient had signs and symptoms of mul- tiple overlapping mental disorders. Her symptoms of anxiety included apprehension during the in- terview, catastrophic thoughts, separation anxi- ety, and irritability. Her symptoms of depression included detachment and isolation at school, negative affect and mood during the evaluation, and loss of interest in activities. Difficulty con- centrating and sleep disturbances are common features of both anxiety and depression.\nAlthough a diagnosis of coexisting anxiety and depressive disorders is common in children who have experienced trauma, the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) best fits this patient\u2019s symptoms. She has unique features of a trauma-related disorder that help to guide our clinical assessment.12\nThe features seen in this patient fulfill formal diagnostic criteria for PTSD (Table 2), including exposure to harm and threat of serious injury, in- trusive memories, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal.21 Still, this diagnosis does not convey the intensity of her symptoms or the degree of her functional impairment, and it does not capture trauma- related developmental regression and somatic symptoms. The child has shown changes in her ability to communicate and form social relation- ships, and she is no longer able to sleep inde- pendently. Her food aversions may be a somatic gastrointestinal manifestation of traumatic stress.23 Finally, it is important to note that the child\u2019s resilience has been bolstered by protective fac- tors including a loving relationship with her mother and previous success in school.\n",
