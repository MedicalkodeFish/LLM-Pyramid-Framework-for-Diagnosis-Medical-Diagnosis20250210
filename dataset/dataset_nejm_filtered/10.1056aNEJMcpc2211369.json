    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Carolina Geadas (Medicine): A 70-year-old man with a history of kidney transplan- tation was evaluated at this hospital because of multiple erythematous rashes that had developed during an admission for respiratory failure, pneumococcal bactere- mia, and kidney failure.\nApproximately 4.5 years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis after he presented with progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure and new hemoptysis. The anti-myeloperoxidase antibody titer was 221.0 U (reference value, <2.8). The patient underwent plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were administered. Hemodialysis was initiated. Two weeks later, ritux- imab was administered, and cyclophosphamide and prednisone were discontin- ued. During the next 4 years, his renal function did not improve, and treatment with rituximab and hemodialysis was continued.\nFour months before the current admission, the patient underwent transplanta- tion of a kidney from a deceased donor with hepatitis C virus antibody\u2013positive status. After the kidney transplantation, immunosuppressive therapy included a dose of basiliximab, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and tapering doses of prednisone. The patient had delayed graft function; the blood creatinine level de- creased from approximately 4.00 mg per deciliter (354 mmol per liter) immedi- ately after transplantation to 1.50 mg per deciliter (133 mmol per liter) 6 weeks later. Six days before the current admission, at a routine follow-up visit, the cre- atinine level was 1.33 mg per deciliter (118 mmol per liter).\nFour days before the current admission, the patient began to have central ab- dominal discomfort, nausea, anorexia, chills, and diarrhea with loose stools three times per day. During the next several days, he noticed decreased urine output and malaise, and he began to have rhinorrhea, cough, sinus congestion, and dyspnea. He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for palpita- tions and dizziness and was negative for fever, emesis, and hematuria. The patient\u2019s brother had recently received a diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patient\u2019s medical history was notable for vasculitis with end-stage kidney disease (culminating in kidney trans- plantation), coronary artery disease (with place- ment of a stent in the right coronary artery), atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyper- tension, cholelithiasis (with cholecystectomy), colonic polyps and diverticulosis, gout, gastro- esophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, hernia (with hernia repair), and spinal stenosis. Medications taken at home included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valganciclovir, warfarin, aspirin, atorvastatin, levothyroxine, and cholecalciferol, as well as lorazepam as needed. Penicillin had caused anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was a retired business owner and\nlived with family in Boston. He had a remote history of tobacco smoking that totaled 10 pack- years; he had quit smoking approximately 40 years earlier. He did not drink alcohol or use other substances. His family history was notable for diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in his father and siblings. There was no known family history of kidney or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 130 beats per minute, the blood pressure 109/56 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 84% while the patient was breathing ambient air, 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal can- nula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high- flow nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared acutely ill and weak. He had bitemporal cachexia, dry oral mucosa, and increased work of breathing. Aus- cultation of the chest revealed tachypnea, dimin- ished breath sounds and crackles in the lungs, and tachycardia. There was tenderness in the periumbilical area and the right lower quadrant, at the site of the kidney transplantation; the inci- sion was well healed.\nBlood levels of lipase, calcium, magnesium,\nand phosphorus were normal; other laboratory test  results  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Blood and urine specimens were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed possible sinus tachy- cardia with right bundle-branch block. Vanco- mycin and cefepime were administered intrave- nously. Three hours after presentation, a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was positive, and remdesivir and dexamethasone were administered intrave- nously.\nDr. Joseph D. King: Radiography of the chest\n(Fig. 1A) revealed confluent basilar consolida- tion in the left lung and scattered patchy opaci- ties in the right lung. Ultrasonography that tar- geted the renal allograft revealed normal renal parenchyma and a trace amount of adjacent free fluid. Doppler ultrasonography (Fig. 1B through 1E) showed patent vasculature with normal flow velocities but showed elevated renal arterial re- sistive indexes, which are suggestive of allograft dysfunction. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1F and 1G), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed confluent consolidation in the lower lobes of both lungs, with more extensive find- ings in the left lung than in the right lung, as  well as patchy multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the upper lobes of both lungs and the middle lobe of the right lung. Concurrent CT of the abdomen and pelvis  (Fig. 1H), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, was remarkable for only a trace amount of free fluid in the right lower quadrant, along the renal allograft.\nDr. Geadas: The  patient was admitted to the\nmedical intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospi- tal. Phenylephrine was administered intravenous- ly. He could not be weaned from the high-flow nasal cannula; because he had increased work of breathing and tachypnea, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation initi- ated. Bronchoscopy revealed dark secretions in the lower lobe and lingula of the left lung. Blood cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae in four of four bottles. A blood test for cyto- megalovirus (CMV) DNA and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative, and serum levels of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan were undetectable. Azithromycin, cefepime, linezolid, amiodarone, furosemide, and vitamin K were administered intravenously, and valganciclovir and atovaquone were administered orally. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed low-normal ventricular function, atrial enlargement, and no valvular vegetations. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated. ANCA titers were undetectable.\nOn hospital day 3, excoriation and erythema of the buttock and a purpuric plaque on the sa- crum were noted (Fig. 2A). Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no changes. Punch biopsy of skin on the right buttock was performed. The antibiotic regimen was transi- tioned to intravenous ceftriaxone.\nThe following day, histologic examination of the skin-biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis, with scattered apoptotic and necrotic keratinocytes and extravasated erythrocytes. No microorganisms were identified, and microbio- logic culture of the biopsy specimen was nega- tive. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 4 are shown in Table 1.\n\nDuring the next 6 days, treatment with con-     \t\n \ntinuous venovenous hemofiltration and intrave- nous ceftriaxone was continued. The level of mechanical ventilation was reduced from man- datory provided breaths to spontaneous ventila- tion, and the mode was switched to pressure- support ventilation. Repeat blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 11, the patient\u2019s respiratory status worsened; the fraction of inspired oxygen was increased, and a mandatory respira- tory rate was reinstituted.\nTwo days later, a new well-circumscribed pur- puric patch was noted on the abdomen (Fig. 2B). The patch measured 5 cm in greatest dimension and had a hyperpigmented halo but had no fluctu- ance or crepitus. The next day, a similar-appearing lesion was noted on the right thigh. Laboratory test results obtained on hospital day 14 are shown in Table 1.\nDr. King: Repeat CT of the chest, abdomen,\nand pelvis showed increased consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Dr. Geadas: Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and vancomycin, cefepime, and liposomal ampho- tericin B were administered intravenously. \n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael K. Mansour: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diag- nosis. This 70-year-old man \u2014 who had  a  his- tory of ANCA-associated vasculitis that was in remission, diabetes, and recent kidney trans- plantation \u2014 was admitted to this hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory failure, for which he received mechanical ventilation. Dur- ing the admission, multiple hemorrhagic, non- blanching skin lesions developed. When I ini- tially evaluated this patient, I constructed a differential diagnosis on the basis of the objec- tive findings that were associated with his im- munocompromised state after solid-organ trans- plantation, as well as his clinical presentation in the context of Covid-19.\nThis patient had undergone kidney transplan- tation 4 months before admission, and his in- duction immunosuppressive therapy included basiliximab (an interleukin-2 receptor blocker), mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and predni- sone. He had delayed graft function but eventu- ally had recovery of renal function. Four days before admission, an acute illness with mainly gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and chills, developed. Covid-19 had been diag- nosed in his brother, so there was a known sick contact. Two days before admission, an upper respiratory illness developed, with cough and rhinorrhea that progressed to dyspnea. The pa- tient presented to the emergency department with a low oxygen saturation (84%) and increased work of breathing. Covid-19 and S. pneumoniae bacteremia were diagnosed. Subsequently, hem- orrhagic rashes involving multiple areas of the body developed. Given the nature and rapid on- set of the skin lesions, infectious causes rose to the top of the differential diagnosis. Noninfec- tious causes, including drug allergy, autoimmu- nity, mechanical injury, and cancer, were also considered. Because the patient was in an immu- nocompromised state, I will explore potential infectious processes that occur in association with immunosuppression, critical illness, and rapidly disseminated skin lesions.\n\nViral Infections\nRash is a characteristic feature of viral infection. Reactivation of herpesviruses is common in im- munocompromised hosts. Specifically, reactivation of herpes simplex virus, CMV, and Epstein\u2013 Barr virus can occur after transplantation, and such infections can have cutaneous manifesta- tions. However, the related skin lesions are typi- cally maculopapular and not hemorrhagic. Vari- cella\u2013zoster virus infection occurs at a higher prevalence among transplant recipients than in the general population, but the rash is vesicular in nature.1 Infection with viruses other than herpesviruses, such as parvovirus and human immunodeficiency virus, can also have cutane- ous manifestations, but the skin findings are likely to be lacy and maculopapular.\nInfection with SARS-CoV-2 is the most likely viral cause of the hemorrhagic lesions in this patient. Cutaneous manifestations of Covid-19 include morbilliform, pernio, or chilblain acral lesions, as well as livedo reticularis, urticaria, vesicles, and purpuric and hemorrhagic lesions.2 The purpura associated with Covid-19 is proba- bly related to the prothrombotic effects of viral infection of endothelial cells. However, this pa- tient\u2019s rash was targetoid in nature and not the diffuse purpura that is typically described with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nBacterial Infections\nMany bacteria can cause skin lesions and rashes. In this patient, blood cultures were transiently positive  for  S. pneumoniae.  Pneumococcus  has  a polysaccharide capsule that is capable of evading the immune response, and this bacterial patho- gen is the most common cause of pneumonia and meningitis in adults. Infection with S. pneu- moniae has a breadth of cutaneous manifesta- tions, which range from macular lesions to rapidly progressive vascular-bed processes, such as purpura fulminans.3 Purpura fulminans re- sults from the rapid evolution of microthrombi in the capillary bed, which leads to large areas  of ischemia. This manifestation can also be as- sociated with other aggressive bacterial infec- tions, including Neisseria meningitidis and capno- cytophaga infections. Although the skin lesions observed in this patient would be consistent with purpura fulminans, the pneumococcal bac- teremia was brief and unlikely to have resulted in such a profound clinical presentation.\nThe patient had been hospitalized for almost 2 weeks, which placed him at risk for nosoco- mial bacterial skin infections. He was at high risk for infection with gram-positive pathogens (such as Staphylococcus aureus) as well as gram- negative pathogens (such as  pseudomonas), both of which can result in various skin lesions.\nS. aureus is classically associated with carbuncles, abscesses, and erysipelas. It has also been linked to vasculitic lesions that are hemorrhagic and thought to be caused by immune-related phenom- ena. Pseudomonas is a gram-negative rod that commonly infects immunocompromised hosts. It can result in a variety of cutaneous lesions,  including ecthyma gangrenosum, which is char- acterized by red macules with a hemorrhagic center and often by ulceration. However, both staphylococcus and pseudomonas are easily de- tected on culture. The absence of these bacteria in routine blood cultures and in the skin-biopsy specimen lowers the likelihood of these infec- tions.\n\nFungal Infections\nThis patient\u2019s history of kidney transplantation increases his risk of disseminated fungal infec- tion. The control of fungal pathogens requires intact, innate, and adaptive immunity. The pa- tient had received immunosuppressive medica- tions for the prevention of renal allograft rejec- tion, which increased his risk of infection with invasive fungal pathogens, including cutaneous infection.4-6 Some fungal pathogens can cause pulmonary infection with dissemination, which would be consistent with this patient\u2019s clinical presentation.5,7\nHistoplasma and blastomyces are dimorphic fungi that grow as mold in the environment and revert to the yeast phase upon infection of a hu- man host. It is possible to find both pathogens in New England. Exposure to blastomyces can result in a severe pulmonary infection that leads to critical illness, and nearly one fifth of af- fected patients have dissemination to the skin, with isolated nodular lesions. Similarly, expo- sure to histoplasma can result in pulmonary infection with dissemination to multiple organs, including the skin; raised nodules with ulcer- ation have been described. Although either of these fungal infections can have symptoms that are consistent with this patient\u2019s illness, they commonly result in lesions that are nodular and not purpuric.\nPathogenic yeast species, such as cryptococcus, can also cause pulmonary infection with dissemination in immunocompromised hosts. Cryptococcus is a ubiquitous yeast that is found worldwide. It causes an initial pulmonary infec- tion that commonly disseminates to multiple organs, including the central nervous system, liver, spleen, and skin. The related skin lesions are nodular and often umbilicated but are rarely purpuric.\nFinally, pathogenic mold species can result in pulmonary infection with dissemination. The molds that most commonly infect humans in- clude aspergillus, fusarium, and mucorales spe- cies. Of these molds, aspergillus is the least likely to spread, whereas fusarium disseminates and can result in hemorrhagic nodules. Mucorales species \u2014 including rhizopus, mucor, rhizomu- cor, cunninghamella, lichtheimia, and apophyso- myces species \u2014 are highly invasive. Rhizopus, specifically, expresses proteins such as spore- coat protein homologues (CotH3), which can bind to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) on endothelial cells and promote angioinvasion.8,9 Infection with mucorales species often results in severe necrotizing processes, including those involving the skin, which are caused by infarc- tion of multiple capillary beds.\nThe diagnosis of infection with mucorales\nspecies is challenging because of the lack of antigen-specific tests, and it often requires ei- ther growth and identification in culture or ribo- somal sequencing. On histopathological exami- nation of a biopsy specimen, the presence of pauciseptate and ribbonlike hyphae that branch at wide angles may be suggestive of mucorales species. In addition, mucorales species have a predilection for skin and soft tissue; studies sug- gest that 10 to 14% of affected patients have skin and soft-tissue involvement at the time of the initial presentation. Moreover, mold infection, specifically infection with aspergillus or muco- rales species, has been associated with SARS- CoV-2 coinfection.10-13\nIn this patient, who was immunocompromised after  solid-organ  transplantation,  presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection and critical illness, and then began to have multiple hemorrhagic, non- blanching skin lesions,  I was highly suspicious  of an angioinvasive process. The pneumococcal bacteremia and Covid-19 appeared to be too mild and brief to account for the severity of his clinical condition. A pulmonary mold superin- fection with dissemination was considered to be the most likely diagnosis. To rapidly establish this diagnosis, skin biopsy of the hemorrhagic lesions was requested to look for fungal ele- ments. If this test is unrevealing, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing can be performed to assist with the diagnosis.\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Rosalynn M. Nazarian: Punch biopsy of skin on the left side of the lower abdomen and on the left buttock was performed on hospital day 14 (Fig. 3). Routine histologic evaluation of sections of the biopsy specimens revealed a pauci-inflam- matory thrombotic vasculopathy with angioinvasive fungal hyphae and necrosis of the epidermis and eccrine glands. SARS-CoV-2 immunostain- ing was negative. Acid-fast, Fite, Brown\u2013Hopps, and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver staining was negative. Periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining with diastase digestion showed broad fungal hyphae involving thrombosed dermal vessels, a finding that is known as mucor thrombus and is consis- tent with cutaneous mucormycosis. Microbiologic cultures were negative, but aseptate hyphae were identified in a fungal wet preparation, which supported the histopathological findings. Genomic sequencing of a tissue specimen later identified Rhizomucor miehei.\nIntravascular thrombosis is a hallmark histo- pathological feature of cutaneous mucormyco- sis. This manifestation has been reported to re- sult from platelet activation through platelet receptor Fc\u03b3RIIa (the low-affinity receptor for the constant fragment of IgG) by fungal spores; the interaction of fungal spores with plasma IgG leads to the formation of immune complexes, which induces platelet aggregation.14 The epider- mis and eccrine glands are metabolically active regions of the skin, which makes them sensitive to ischemia.15 In this patient, the necrosis ob- served on the first biopsy was probably related  to hypoxia at pressure areas (a manifestation frequently described as coma bullae), and the necrosis observed on the second biopsy was probably related to infarction due to intravascu- lar thrombosis.15\nNo  evidence of vasculitis (vessel-wall inflam-\nmation) was observed on either skin biopsy; this helps to rule out the possibility of recurrent ANCA-associated vasculitis in this patient.16 No pathologically significant perivascular or inter- stitial inflammatory infiltrate was present in the skin-biopsy specimen obtained from the left but- tock; this suggests the possibility of thrombotic vasculopathy related to warfarin use (warfarin- induced skin necrosis), heparin injection (heparin- induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis), dis- seminated intravascular coagulation, or an inherited procoagulant state, such as antithrom- bin III deficiency.17 Covid-19 can also induce a prothrombotic state that is associated in part with abnormal levels of acute-phase reactants (e.g., elevated d-dimer levels and decreased antithrombin levels) that contribute to thrombotic events in affected patients.18 The detection of angioinvasive fungal forms helps to distinguish cutaneous mucormycosis from these histopathological mimics. Because mucor thrombus may be subtle, vigilance is needed to avoid a missed diagnosis.\n\n",
