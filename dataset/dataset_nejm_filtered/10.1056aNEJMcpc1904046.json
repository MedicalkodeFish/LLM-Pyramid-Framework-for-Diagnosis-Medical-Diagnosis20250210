    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Rachel Wood (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 35-year-old pregnant woman was admitted to the labor and delivery unit of this hospital at 36 weeks 4 days of ges- tation for a planned repeat cesarean section because of placenta previa.\nAt 6 weeks 4 days of gestation, the patient had been seen at a community health center because of a positive pregnancy test. She was gravida 4, 1-0-2-1. Her first pregnancy, 5 years earlier, had resulted in the need for a cesarean section because the fetus was in the breech presentation; the baby was delivered at full term with- out complications. The second and third pregnancies had been electively termi- nated. The patient reported that her husband had human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and that he had been taking antiretroviral therapy; he had had undetectable plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA during the 5 months before this visit. Blood testing in the patient for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and HIV-1 p24 antigen with the use of a fourth-generation combination assay was negative. Pre- exposure prophylaxis with a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was prescribed.\nThe patient continued to receive routine prenatal care at the community health\ncenter. At 16 weeks 5 days of gestation, the result of an oral glucose tolerance test was abnormal, and a diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus was made. Dietary modifications, exercise, and fingerstick glucose monitoring were prescribed. Ob- stetrical ultrasonography with fetal survey performed at 18 weeks 4 days of gesta- tion revealed a placenta that was positioned anteriorly, with complete placenta previa. The results of all other prenatal screening tests were normal. The blood type was O, Rh-positive, with negative antibody testing. The patient was advised not to have sexual intercourse and to seek immediate medical attention if vaginal bleeding were to occur. She was informed that a cesarean delivery would be sched- uled to occur between 36 and 37 weeks of gestation.\nTwenty-five days before presentation, at 33 weeks of gestation, vaginal bleeding developed, and the patient was brought by ambulance to the obstetrical unit of this hospital. She reported that on awakening that morning, she had passed a large volume of bright red, liquid blood and three large clots, each measuring approximately 1.5 cm in diam- eter, through the vagina. She felt occasional contractions; fetal movement was normal. She reported no recent trauma, fall, or sexual inter- course. On examination, the patient appeared well. The pulse was 112 beats per minute, and other vital signs were normal. The abdomen was gravid, soft, and nontender. A speculum exami- nation revealed a closed cervical os, a small amount of bright red blood, and no pooling fluid. The hemoglobin level was 11.5 g per deci- liter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0), and the hematocrit was 35.0% (reference range, 36.0 to 46.0). On a nonstress test, the fetal heart rate was 140 beats per minute, with moderate vari- ability, accelerations, and a single deceleration with a rapid return to baseline.\nUltrasonographic examination was performed;\nthe placenta was positioned anteriorly along the midline of the uterus, completely overlying the cervical os, and there was no evidence of pla- centa accreta. The measurements of the fetus were appropriate for gestational age, with a bio- physical profile score of 8/8 (indicating normal fetal well-being).\nThe patient was admitted to the labor and delivery unit for observation. External tocodyna- mometry showed uterine irritability; magnesium, betamethasone, and penicillin were administered, but the contractions persisted. After she received additional treatment with oral nifedipine, the contractions stopped. No additional vaginal bleed- ing occurred, and the hemoglobin level and hematocrit remained stable. Postprandial hyper- glycemia was noted, and a regimen of subcuta- neous insulin was initiated. The patient was discharged home on the fifth hospital day.\nTwo days after discharge, at 33 weeks 6 days of gestation, unprovoked vaginal bleeding re- curred, and the patient was transported by am- bulance to the emergency department at another hospital. She reported copious bright red vaginal bleeding, with several large clots, and pelvic cramping; fetal movement was normal. On exam- ination, the patient appeared well, and the vital signs were normal. The abdomen was gravid and soft, with mild tenderness on palpation at the fundus. A speculum examination revealed a closed cervix and approximately 5 ml of dark brown blood in the vaginal vault, with no ongoing bleeding through the os. The patient was trans- ferred by ambulance to the antepartum care unit of this hospital; the fetal heart rate was 145 beats per minute, with moderate variability and accelerations and without decelerations. Labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was observed for 4 days; she had no contractions or further vaginal bleeding. On the third hospital day, she was discharged home, and a cesarean section was scheduled for 36 weeks 4 days of gestation.\nOn admission for the scheduled cesarean delivery, the patient reported feeling well, with no abdominal pain, contractions, or recurrent vaginal bleeding. She was obese and had a his- tory of sciatica, for which she had undergone lumbar laminectomy in the remote past. Medica- tions included prenatal vitamins and subcutane- ous insulin. She had no known allergies. The patient had been born in southeastern Africa and lived in New England. She was monoga- mous with her husband and did not smoke to- bacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. The family medical history was unknown.\nThat afternoon, the patient underwent cesarean section under combined spinal\u2013epidural anesthesia. Cefazolin was administered intrave- nously before incision of the skin. During the surgery, a low transverse uterine incision was made through the anterior placenta. The mem- branes were ruptured bluntly, yielding clear amni- otic fluid. The uterine incision was extended, and the infant was delivered 37 minutes after injection of the spinal anesthetic agent, which was administered during a combined spinal\u2013epi- dural procedure; the opaque surgical drape was lowered, allowing the patient to see the infant through the clear drape. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were 8 and 10, respectively. The placenta was removed with gentle traction. Three minutes after delivery of the infant, while clot and debris were being cleared from the uterine cavity, the exteriorized uterus became blanched with minimal bleeding. Concurrently, the patient was noted to be unresponsive, with sporadic respirations; carotid and aortic pulses were present. Manual ventilation was begun. Two minutes later, the patient became pulseless, with normal sinus rhythm seen on the patient monitor of the anesthesia machine. Cardiopulmo- nary resuscitation was begun, the trachea was in- tubated, and mechanical ventilation was initiated. Thirty-eight minutes after delivery of the in- fant, generalized bleeding and oozing began, with blood and debris emanating from the surgical incision and spreading throughout the operative field. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sarah N. Bernstein: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. This 35-year-old healthy woman who was undergoing a repeat elective cesarean section for placenta previa had sudden cardiovascular collapse moments after delivery of the placenta. While we initiated cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion, we began to rapidly construct a differential diagnosis to identify the underlying cause (Ta- ble 2) and to institute appropriate interventions.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\nDid this patient have a pulmonary embolism that led to cardiovascular collapse? In support of this diagnosis was the acute nature of the event and the fact that the patient had several risk factors for pulmonary embolism, including hypercoagulability, pregnancy, advanced maternal age,and obesity. However, in preparation for surgery, sequential compression devices were placed on the patient\u2019s legs to prevent the development of deep-vein thrombosis. Furthermore, in the absence of deep-vein thrombosis, which was not noted during placement of the compression devices, it would be unusual for a clot to form and migrate so quickly during the surgical procedure. In addi- tion, the patient lost consciousness without any reports of dyspnea or chest pain, symptoms that often precede a pulmonary embolism. Neverthe- less, pulmonary embolism is one of the most common causes of cardiovascular collapse in pregnant women and cannot be ruled out in this patient without the performance of diagnostic imaging and laboratory tests.\nHemorrhage\nThe patient had multiple risk factors for hemor- rhage, and this was the adverse outcome for which we were most prepared. Given that she had had a previous cesarean section and that she had a complete anterior placenta previa in this pregnancy, we had concerns about a potential placenta accreta. We observed no signs of pla- centa accreta on antenatal ultrasonography, but we were prepared to administer blood products if clinically significant bleeding developed. The placenta was delivered with ease, the uterine tone was excellent, and bleeding at the surgical site was well controlled. We handed the newborn to our colleagues in Pediatrics, and just after we exteriorized the uterus, the patient became non- responsive. Hemorrhage as a cause of acute cardiovascular collapse was quickly dismissed because there was minimal bleeding at the surgi- cal site and the uterus appeared entirely blanched and malperfused.\n\nVenous Air Embolism\nVenous air embolism has been reported to occur at the time of cesarean section.1 This diagnosis should be considered any time the operative site is positioned above the patient\u2019s heart, which oc- curred in this patient when the uterus was exte- riorized. However, as is the case with pulmonary embolism, these events are often preceded by wheezing, dyspnea, chest pain, or gasping.\n\nAnaphylaxis\nAnaphylaxis was also a consideration in this case, given that many medications were administered before and during the procedure. However, the patient did not have any known drug allergies, and the timing for an anaphylactic event did not fit well, since cardiovascular collapse occurred more than 30 minutes after these treatment ex- posures. In addition, no rash, hypotension, dys- pnea, or wheezing preceded the event.\n\nHigh Cephalad Spread of Neuraxial Anesthetic Agent\nHigh cephalad spread of a neuraxial anesthetic agent can cause sudden loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest, but in this case, the event occurred more than 30 minutes after injection of the spinal anesthetic agent, which was adminis- tered during a combined spinal\u2013epidural proce- dure. There were no technical difficulties with injection of the spinal anesthetic agent, which resulted in analgesia bilaterally at the level of the T4 dermatome. No medication was injected through the epidural catheter. In addition, there was no evidence of respiratory distress, difficulty swallowing or talking, bradycardia, or weakness in the arms leading up to the event.\n\nPeripartum Cardiomyopathy and Myocardial Infarction\nThe patient had risk factors for peripartum car- diomyopathy, including being in the late stage of pregnancy, being of advanced maternal age, and being of African descent. However, before under- going the surgery, the patient was in her usual state of health and did not have symptoms that were consistent with heart failure, such as wors- ening dyspnea or pedal edema. Myocardial in- farction is rare in women of reproductive age, but this patient had several risk factors, including pregnancy, advanced maternal age, and obesity. However, this patient\u2019s presentation would not be typical for myocardial infarction, given that she had no dyspnea, chest pain, or nausea lead- ing up to the event. Furthermore, when the pa- tient became pulseless, she remained in sinus rhythm, with no evidence of clinically significant ischemia seen on the patient monitor of the anesthesia machine.\n\nEclampsia\nEclampsia should be considered in any pregnant woman who has an acute change in mental sta- tus. However, this patient was normotensive and did not report headaches, vision changes, or pain in the right upper quadrant. Also, she did not show any signs of seizure activity.\n\nAmniotic Fluid Embolism\nCould this patient have had an amniotic f luid embolism? Despite the advances of modern medicine, amniotic fluid embolism remains one of the most feared diagnoses of obstetrical pro- viders. These events are rare, with an estimated prevalence of only 1 in 16,000 to 50,000 deliver- ies.2 The outcomes are catastrophic, with mor- tality rates as high as 20 to 60% in the United States,3 and among those who survive, 61% are left with clinically significant neurologic conse- quences.4 Unlike placenta accreta, amniotic fluid embolism remains an unpredictable event, with no demographic or clinical risk factors that have been sufficiently studied to justify alterations in standard obstetrical care.2\nAmniotic fluid embolism is often  described in the context of a classic biphasic2 triad of events that includes sudden cardiovascular col- lapse occurring around the time of labor and delivery, followed by the development of coagu- lopathy and hemorrhage (Fig. 1).4,5 The first in- sult, cardiovascular collapse, most likely results from vasospasm of the pulmonary vasculature, clinically significant hypoxemia, heart failure on the right side, and cardiac arrest. This patient presented with cardiopulmonary arrest, which is one of the most common presenting signs and symptoms; it is reported to occur in 87% of women with amniotic fluid embolism.4 If the patient survives this initial insult, dilatation of the right side of the heart occurs, which leads to compression of the left side of the heart, de- creased filling pressure, and heart failure, followed by elevation of the pulmonary-artery pressure. Subsequently, right heart function improves. In patients who survive the initial cardiac event, a severe consumptive coagulopathy develops that must be corrected rapidly. Other common signs include hypotension, fetal distress (if still preg- nant), and pulmonary edema. This patient had the classic triad of events associated with amniotic fluid embolism, making this the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n",
