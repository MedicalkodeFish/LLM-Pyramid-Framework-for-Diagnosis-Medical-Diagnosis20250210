    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. P. Connor Johnson (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with fever, flank pain, and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until approximately 4 weeks before admission, when she noted tender bilateral inguinal swelling. Two days later, she began to have sharp, intermittent flank pain on the right side; she rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. During the next 3 days, she had nausea and a poor appetite. She noted foul-smelling urine but had no dysuria, urinary frequency, or hematuria.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care physician. On examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, and she appeared well. There was costovertebral and abdominal tenderness on the right side, without re- bound or guarding. The external genitalia were normal. Copious thin, white vagi- nal discharge was present; no cervical motion tenderness was noted, and the ovaries were normal on palpation. Multiple bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes, measuring up to 2 cm in diameter, were noted on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. On microscopic examination of the vaginal dis- charge, clue cells were observed, but there were no fungal elements or trichomo- nads. Nucleic acid amplification tests of a cervical swab for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were negative. A blood test for IgM, IgG, and IgA antibod- ies to C. trachomatis serovars L1 and D through K was negative. Urinalysis revealed leukocyte esterase and nitrates; urine was obtained for culture. Vaginal metroni- dazole gel was prescribed.\nTwo days later, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units\n(CFU) of Escherichia coli per milliliter and 10,000 to 100,000 CFU of Klebsiella pneu- moniae per milliliter. A 14-day course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole was prescribed. The inguinal swelling reportedly abated, but the flank pain and nausea persisted. Two days after the patient completed the prescribed course of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fever and night sweats developed. After 3 days of fever with a temperature of up to 38.5\u00b0C, she began vomiting and subsequently presented to the emer- gency department of this hospital for evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient re- ported ongoing flank pain, malaise, nausea, and poor appetite with weight loss of 2.3 kg during the past month. There was no sore throat, cough, or diarrhea. She had a history of hypothyroid- ism, asthma, bipolar disorder, dysmenorrhea, and migraines. She had had multiple urinary tract infections; pyelonephritis had been diagnosed 4 years before this presentation. A copper intra- uterine device had been inserted 6 months before this presentation. Medications included albuterol, budesonide\u2013formoterol, divalproex, levothyroxine, loratadine, and sumatriptan as needed for mi- graines. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She had im- migrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier; she had been living in New England dur- ing the past year and had been working in a laboratory. She had recently spent 3 months in Brazil visiting her husband and had returned to New England shortly before she noted inguinal swelling. While in Brazil, she had remained in a large city and had not visited any remote loca- tions. In New England, she lived alone with one kitten and one full-grown cat. There was no family history of cancer. An aunt had died from tuberculosis, but the patient had had only mini-\nmal contact with her aunt.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 100/63 mm Hg, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 67.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The patient ap- peared ill. The right side of the abdomen was tender on palpation, without rebound or guard- ing. Hepatosplenomegaly was not present. Tender bilateral inguinal lymph nodes were noted. No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy was noted. The re- mainder of the physical examination was nor- mal. A urine test for human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, creatine kinase, and lactate dehy- drogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Madeleine Sertic: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1), performed without the administration of intravenous con- trast material, revealed bilateral inguinal lymph- adenopathy, with the largest node, on the right side, measuring 2.6 cm in greatest dimension. A right pelvic sidewall lymph node measuring 1.3 cm in greatest dimension, a gastrohepatic lymph node measuring 0.9 cm in greatest dimension, and lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis were also seen. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed an intrauterine device in an appropriate position, normal ovaries, and trace free fluid in the pelvis. Dr. Johnson: Intravenous fluids and intramuscu-  lar ketorolac were administered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. \n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Richelle C. Charles: This 39-year-old woman presented to this hospital with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, flank pain on the right side, and abdominal pain, with systemic symptoms of fever, night sweats, anorexia, and weight loss after a 3-month stay in Brazil.\nThe causes of lymphadenopathy can be con- sidered in broad disease-based categories, includ- ing infection, cancer, autoimmune disease, and other various disorders. The approach to evaluating a patient with lymphadenopathy typically includes determining whether the lymphadenopa- thy is localized, involving only one region, or whether it is generalized, affecting more than one region. This initial assessment, together with thorough history taking and physical examina- tion to identify epidemiologic clues (e.g., exposure to cats, recent travel, insect bites, or high-risk sexual behavior) or pathologic features distal to the involved lymph nodes, can substantially narrow down the possibilities and, in most cases, lead to a diagnosis.\nThis patient had inguinal lymphadenopathy that was present predominantly on the right side, with contiguous pelvic wall lymphadenopathy seen on abdominal CT, findings that suggested a regional process. She had inguinal lymphade- nopathy on the left side, as well, but the develop- ment of lymphadenopathy on both sides of the inguinal region can occur if the underlying process originates from a central site, such as from a sexually transmitted infection or from the unlikely event of inoculation of a pathogen that affects both legs. The abdominal CT also revealed an enlarged gastrohepatic lymph node and lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis, find- ings that raise the possibility of a generalized process or early disseminated disease. Because fever and inguinal lymphadenopathy are the pre- dominant features in this case, I will construct my differential diagnosis around this symptom complex.\nMycobacterial Infection\nGiven that this patient had immigrated to the United States from Brazil 1 year earlier, chronic infections or reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis or endemic mycosis should be considered. Isolated peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis is most often due to reactivation disease.1 Typically, tuberculous lymphadenitis is painless, and the most common site of involve- ment is the cervical lymph nodes, but other pe- ripheral lymph nodes can be involved.1 This pa- tient had lymphadenopathy in the porta hepatis; however, if she had abdominal tuberculosis, I would expect mesenteric lymphadenopathy, intes- tinal wall thickening, or ascites, all of which were absent in this case. Her fever, nausea, vomit- ing, weight loss, and abdominal pain would be consistent with this diagnosis, as would her ele- vated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reac- tive protein level but otherwise normal laboratory test results. Although the patient had a negative interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis, a negative test does not necessarily rule out tuber- culosis.\nInfection due to nontuberculous mycobacte-\nria is also a possible diagnosis in this patient, but nontuberculous mycobacterial lymphadenitis is seen more often in children than in adults and would be rare in an immunocompetent adult.2 Infection with M. marinum can cause a nodular skin infection with accompanying lymphadenop- athy and is associated with skin trauma and ex- posure to a contaminated water source, but iso- lated lymphadenopathy without associated skin findings would be unusual.\n\nBartonella henselae Infection\nBecause the patient has a kitten and a cat, infec- tion with bartonella species \u2014 specifically Bar- tonella henselae, the primary causative agent of cat scratch disease \u2014 is a consideration in this case.3 Cats, particularly kittens, are the main reservoir of B. henselae; they transmit the bacte- ria through their saliva or through scratching (approximately 50% of cats are seropositive for\nB. henselae).4,5 This patient did not have any evi- dence of scratch marks on examination, and information about previous scratches was not provided in the case presentation. Typically, a skin lesion (i.e., a papule, vesicle, or pustule) forms at the scratch site 3 to 10 days after in- oculation; however, such a lesion is not always seen or properly identified.6 Approximately 2 weeks after inoculation, regional lymphadenopathy proximal to the inoculation site, a characteristic feature of cat scratch disease, develops.6 The most commonly involved sites of lymphadenopathy are the axillary, epitrochlear, cervical, supraclavicular, and submandibular regions.6 Generalized lymph- adenopathy is rare, but up to a third of cases involve more than one anatomical site.6 Although lymphadenopathy associated with cat scratch disease usually resolves within 1 to 6 months without therapy,7 the current recommendation is treatment with a short course of azithromycin.8 Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, which this pa- tient received, does have in vitro activity against bartonella species and has been shown to be clinically effective in some cases.7 This could explain why this patient\u2019s condition improved initially but later worsened after cessation of these antibiotic agents. The typical duration of treatment is 5 days for uncomplicated cat scratch disease. This patient received 2 weeks of therapy, but given the extent of her disease and involvement of gastrohepatic nodes and nodes in the porta hepatis \u2014 findings that could sug- gest early dissemination of B. hensalae \u2014 she probably would have needed a longer course of treatment.\n\nToxoplasmosis\nToxoplasmosis and cat scratch disease are both associated with adenopathy and exposure to cats. However, acute toxoplasmosis is manifested by a mononucleosis-like syndrome characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy or generalized, diffuse lymphadenopathy9 that is similar to that seen in patients with acute Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection, acute cytomegalovirus infection, and primary HIV infection. Because this patient had many features that were consistent with acute toxo- plasmosis, it is difficult to rule out this diagno- sis without additional testing for toxoplasmosis.\n\nBacterial Infections of the Skin and Soft Tissues\nBacterial adenitis, which is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, is a common type of acute unilateral lymphadenitis; however, the absence of signs of a leg infection makes these diagnoses unlikely. Less common causes of lymphadenitis include tularemia, nocar- diosis, and sporotrichosis, all of which can cause regional lymphadenopathy distal to a site of in- oculation. Typically, associated skin findings would be expected with tularemia, nocardiosis, and sporotrichosis; however, tularemia also has a glandular form without associated skin find- ings.10 However, the epidemiologic features of tularemia (e.g., exposure to an infected animal or an animal bite) do not fit with this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nThe sexually transmitted infections that are com- monly associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy are lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), syphilis, and chancroid. Of these, LGV is the most likely diagnosis for this patient, given her symptoms, the timing of onset of symptoms, and the ab- sence of skin findings on pelvic examination. LGV is a genital ulcer disease caused by the L1, L2, and L3 serovars of C. trachomatis.11 Histori- cally, it has been most prevalent in the tropics and subtropics, but its prevalence has been in- creasing in high-income countries, primarily among men who have sex with men.11 The primary stage of infection is characterized by the presence of a genital ulcer at the site of inocula- tion that spontaneously heals within a few days. The secondary stage, occurring 2 to 6 weeks later, can be manifested by an enlarged, painful reactive inguinal node and is related to direct extension of the infection to the regional nodes.11 The secondary stage can also be associated with anorectal symptoms including proctocolitis.11 The diagnosis is based on the clinical presenta- tion and epidemiologic findings and is con- firmed by nucleic acid testing.11 Serologic testing can also be performed to support the diagnosis. This patient underwent testing for LGV; both a serologic test and a nucleic acid test for C. tracho- matis were negative.\nThe absence of genital ulcers in this patient\nmakes chancroid, primary herpes simplex virus infection, and syphilis unlikely.12 The secondary stage of syphilis is typically manifested by rash and generalized lymphadenopathy; regional lymphadenopathy, as seen in this case, would be atypical of syphilis.\n\nTravel-Related Infections\nThis patient had recently returned from a 3-month stay in Brazil visiting her husband. Many travel- related illnesses can be associated with fever and lymphadenopathy, including dengue virus infec- tion, chikungunya virus infection, Zika virus infection, brucellosis, leptospirosis, enteric fever (typhoid or paratyphoid fever), and bartonellosis (caused by B. quintana and B. bacilliformis).13 With the exception of enteric fever, which would be manifested by mesenteric lymphadenopathy, these illnesses are usually associated with diffuse lymphadenopathy rather than the regional lymph- adenopathy seen in this patient. Infection with dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses can be ruled out in this case, since patients typically present with fever within 2 weeks after exposure. Endemic mycoses, such as paracoccidioidomy- cosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidi- oidomycosis, can cause widespread lymphade- nopathy in patients with disseminated disease and are usually associated with hepatospleno- megaly and bone marrow dysfunction.14 This patient had no recent exposures (she stayed in a city) or pulmonary symptoms that would sug- gest primary infection, and she was immuno- competent, which makes reactivation disease or disseminated disease unlikely.\nCancer, Autoimmune Diseases, and Other Conditions\nGiven the presence of fever, lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and weight loss, lymphoma must be considered in this case. Common tumors that metastasize to the inguinal lymph nodes include squamous-cell carcinoma of the vulva, penis, and anus15; however, the patient\u2019s clinical examina- tion and symptoms were not consistent with these diagnoses. A history of rash, weakness, or arthralgias is absent, making autoimmune dis- orders an unlikely cause of her presentation. Sarcoidosis characteristically manifests as pulmo- nary hilar lymphadenopathy (in 90% of cases) but can also be associated with peripheral lymphadenopathy.16\nIn summary, this patient\u2019s presentation with\nregional tender lymphadenopathy and history of exposure to cats makes cat scratch disease the most likely diagnosis in this case. An atypical presentation of a systemic infection, a systemic granulomatous process such as sarcoidosis, and lymphoproliferative disorder cannot be ruled out. To establish the diagnosis, I would recommend a right inguinal lymph-node biopsy and sero- logic testing for B. henselae and other infectious causes.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Aliyah R. Sohani: A right inguinal lymph-node biopsy was performed on an outpatient basis after the patient was discharged from the hospi- tal. Microscopic examination of the biopsy spec- imen (Fig. 2) revealed architectural distortion characterized by marked capsular fibrosis, hyper- vascularity with increased plasma cells, f lorid reactive follicular hyperplasia, focal clusters of monocytoid B cells, and prominent granuloma- tous inflammation without neutrophils or ne- crosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed polytypic plasma cells and an appropriate num- ber and distribution of B cells and T cells, and concurrent flow cytometry showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell population or an unusual T-cell population. Although an infectious cause appeared most likely, the combination of morphologic features did not point to a specific cause.\nIn addition, numerous stains for microorgan- isms were negative; these included acid-fast stain- ing for mycobacteria, Grocott methenamine\u2013 silver staining for fungi, and Steiner staining and Warthin\u2013Starry silver staining for spirochetes and other bacteria, as well as immunohistochem- ical staining for antibodies against Treponema pallidum, Toxoplasma gondii, and cytomegalovirus. It was difficult to reconcile these lymph node findings with serologic testing for bartonella that had been performed at the time of the pa- tient\u2019s admission; the testing had shown a mark- edly elevated B. henselae IgG titer of 1:1024 or higher (reference titer, <1:128) and a moderately elevated B. quintana IgG titer of 1:512 (reference titer, <1:128), with undetectable B. henselae and B. quintana IgM titers of less than 1:20 (reference range for both, <1:20). In patients with lymph- adenitis related to B. henselae infection (i.e., cat scratch disease), suppurative granulomas associ- ated with neutrophilic clusters and central necro- sis would be expected to be present, as would organisms on Warthin\u2013Starry silver stain17; how- ever, these features were not seen on histologic evaluation.\nFigure 2. Biopsy Specimen of a Right Inguinal Lymph Node, Initial Diagnostic Evaluation.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining shows marked capsular thickening and fibrosis (Panel A). At the interface of the capsule and lymphoid tissue, there are prominent small vessels associated with increased plasma cells (Panel B, arrows), which were polytypic on RNA in situ hybridization for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains (not shown). Some areas of the underlying lymphoid tissue contain increased numbers of reactive follicles (Panel C, arrows) with interspersed aggregates of reactive monocytoid B cells (Panel D), and other areas contain conspicuous histio\u2011 cytic infiltrates that are consistent with ill\u2011formed granulomas (Panel E, arrows). At higher magnification, histiocytes that can be seen within the granulomas are associated with small lymphocytes and plasma cells; giant cells and neutrophils are not present, and there is no central necrosis (Panel F).\n\nDr. Sohani: PCR testing for the 16S rRNA gene showed the presence of B. henselae DNA. Reevaluation of the original Warthin\u2013Starry silver stain from the patient\u2019s right inguinal lymph-node bi- opsy confirmed the absence of detectable organ- isms. Warthin\u2013Starry silver staining was repeated on the paraffin-embedded block of lymph-node tissue that had been evaluated initially and was performed on all three remaining paraffin- embedded blocks of lymph-node tissue that had been submitted for microscopic evaluation. In a single block \u2014 one that was different from the one originally stained \u2014 Warthin\u2013Starry silver staining highlighted scattered small foci of pleo- morphic bacilli in clumps and clusters associat- ed with small vessels, findings that were consistent with B. henselae infection (Fig. 3A and 3B).\nWe hypothesized that the initiation of therapy before the lymph-node biopsy had altered the typical histologic appearance of cat scratch dis- ease and resulted in a paucity of detectable or- ganisms.\n",
