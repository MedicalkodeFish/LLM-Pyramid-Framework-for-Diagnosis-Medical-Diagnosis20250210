    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Yuefan Chen (Anesthesia, Critical Care, and Pain Medicine): A 59-year-old woman had hypotension and electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment abnormalities after the administration of anesthetic agents while she was in the operating room of this hospital.\nEighteen weeks before the current presentation, features of acromegaly were observed on routine physical examination by the patient\u2019s primary care provider at another hospital. The blood level of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) was 595 ng per milliliter (reference range, 50 to 317) and the growth hormone level 9.1 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.0 to 7.1). The patient was referred to the endocrinology clinic of this hospital.\nEleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the endocrinology clinic. She reported that her shoe size, which had been stable since young adulthood, had recently increased by two sizes. She also reported a deepen- ing of her voice, fatigue, headaches, arthralgias, oily skin, skin tags, and acne on her face and back. She had had an intentional weight loss of 12.7 kg during the previous 9 months. The facial features were coarse, and there was no frontal boss- ing. Visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The tongue was thick and obscured the soft palate; the lower jaw was enlarged, with increased spacing be- tween the teeth. The hands and feet were large and fleshy. Scattered skin tags were present on the neck. Auscultation of the heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed a normal-sized pitu- itary gland with a well-circumscribed area of hypoenhancement that measured 9 mm by 7 mm by 10 mm. The patient was referred to the neurosurgery clinic of this hospital, and an elective microscopic transsphenoidal hypophysectomy was subse- quently recommended.\nSeven weeks before the current presentation, an extensive preoperative evaluation was performed, given the patient\u2019s diagno- sis of acromegaly. As part of the preoperative evaluation, additional history was obtained. The patient\u2019s medical history included hypertension, prediabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and scoliosis. Physical activity was limited by pain in the knees; she could climb a flight of stairs but did so very slowly because of knee pain. She had no chest pain or dyspnea. Medications included hydrochlorothia- zide, olmesartan, and ibuprofen and acetamino- phen as needed for joint pain. Hydroxychloro- quine had caused leukopenia, and meperidine had caused gastrointestinal upset. The patient lived in a rural area of New England with her husband and worked in an office. She did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; she drank alcohol rarely. Multiple maternal and paternal family members had cardiovascular disease.\nECG revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific\nST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, including a T-wave inversion in lead III. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal left ven- tricular volume and systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%, and there were no wall-motion abnormalities. The right ventricular volume and systolic function were normal; the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure was 28 mm Hg. Mild mitral regurgita- tion and tricuspid regurgitation were present. A pharmacologic stress test, with myocardial per- fusion imaging performed after the administra- tion of regadenoson, revealed no evidence of ischemia.\nThree weeks before the current presentation,\nthe patient was taken to the operating room for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy. The preopera- tive temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 131/69 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 35.7. Midazolam was administered, and anesthesia was induced with fentanyl, propofol, lidocaine, and rocuronium. Tracheal intubation was mod- erately challenging because of the presence of redundant tissue in the supraglottic region. Dur- ing intubation, the oxygen saturation decreased to 79% but normalized in less than 1 minute. Inhaled sevoflurane (an anesthetic) and dexameth-\n \n\nasone and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam were admin- istered, remifentanil and phenylephrine infusions were started, and the patient was placed in a level, supine position for the procedure.\nAfter the induction of anesthesia, before the surgical procedure was initiated, the blood pres- sure gradually decreased (Fig. 1A). Sixteen min- utes after induction began, the blood pressure was  96/48  mm  Hg  and  the  heart  rate  75  beats per minute; 29 minutes after induction began, the blood pressure had decreased to 67/36 mm Hg and the heart rate to 71 beats per minute. Tele- metric monitoring (Fig. 2A) showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the ante- rior and lateral leads. Aspirin was administered rectally, the rate of the phenylephrine infusion was increased, and multiple boluses of phenyl- ephrine and an ephedrine bolus were adminis- tered.  The  blood  pressure  increased  to  110/54 mm Hg and the heart rate to 111 beats per minute. Telemetric monitoring showed resolu- tion of the ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Findings on ECG and transesophageal echocar- diography (TEE) performed in the operating room were consistent with those of the preoperative ECG and TTE. The procedure was aborted, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor thera- pies, and the trachea was extubated. She was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit.\nOn admission to the cardiac intensive care\nunit, the blood level of troponin T was 10 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 9); 1 hour later, the level had decreased to 8 ng per liter. Other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiography was normal. Computed tomograph- ic angiography of the coronary arteries revealed moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior de- scending coronary artery. The intraoperative ST- segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm. Treatment with amlodipine and iso- sorbide mononitrate was initiated for coronary vasospasm, and treatment with atorvastatin was started for nonobstructive coronary artery dis- ease. After discussion among the cardiology, neurosurgery, and anesthesia teams, it was de- termined that the patient remained a candidate for transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, particularly because the surgery could offer a cure for her acromegaly; the procedure was rescheduled. The patient was discharged home on the third hos- pital day.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, the patient continued taking the newly prescribed medica- tions, and no new symptoms developed. On the day of the current presentation, she was again taken to the operating room to undergo transs- phenoidal hypophysectomy. The preoperative blood pressure, as measured through an arterial cath- eter,  was  118/67  mm  Hg  and  the  heart  rate  88 beats per minute. Sedation with fentanyl and mid- azolam was started, topical lidocaine was used to anesthetize the airways, and fiberoptic tracheal intubation was performed while the patient was awake. Anesthesia was then induced with propo- fol, rocuronium, and sevoflurane. A phenyleph- rine infusion was started, and piperacillin\u2013tazo- bactam was administered.\nThe blood pressure decreased abruptly to\n54/29  mm  Hg  (Fig.  1B).  Telemetric  monitoring (Fig. 2B) showed ST-segment elevations in the in- ferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Management decisions were made, and a di-\nagnostic test was performed.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page). Intraoperative Vital Signs.\nVital signs were recorded during two separate episodes of hypotension with concurrent ST\u2011segment elevation after the administration of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. During the induction of anesthesia that preceded the first attempted procedure (Panel A), there was a grad\u2011 ual onset of hypotension over a period of 10 to 15 min\u2011 utes for which the patient received doses of vasopres\u2011 sors that were higher than those typically used to restore normotension. During the induction of anes\u2011 thesia that preceded the second attempted procedure (Panel B), there was an abrupt and profound drop in the systolic blood pressure immediately after the ad\u2011 ministration of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. Dexametha\u2011 sone was administered to treat possible adrenal insuf\u2011 ficiency, and epinephrine was administered in escalating doses, followed by an infusion. The systolic and dia\u2011 stolic blood pressure was measured with a sphygmo\u2011 manometer during the first induction and through an arterial catheter during the second induction.\n\nFigure 2 (facing page). Intraoperative Telemetric Moni- toring.\nIntraoperative telemetric monitoring performed during the patient\u2019s hypotensive episodes shows ST\u2011segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF, with reciprocal de\u2011 pressions in leads I and aVR, during the administration of anesthetics before the first attempted procedure (Panel A) and during the administration of anesthetics before the second attempted procedure (Panel B).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Wilton A. van Klei: This 59-year-old woman with obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea presented for transsphenoidal hypophy- sectomy. A preoperative cardiac evaluation in- cluded echocardiography, which revealed a nor- mal ejection fraction, and a pharmacologic stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia. After the induction of anesthesia, the blood pressure gradually  decreased  from  131/69  mm  Hg  to 67/36  mm  Hg,  and  ECG  changes  suggestive  of cardiac ischemia developed. I will first consider possible causes of the intraoperative hypotension that occurred during the induction of anesthesia that preceded the first attempted procedure.\n\nIntraoperative Hypotension\nA decrease in blood pressure after the induction of anesthesia is common. The degree of decrease in blood pressure that is considered to be abnor- mal is not clear, since a single definition of intra- operative hypotension that applies to all patients does not exist. The most commonly used thresh- old is a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg, which is associated with adverse out- comes such as myocardial injury, kidney injury, and death. Nearly two thirds of patients under general anesthesia have at least one episode of intraoperative hypotension when the condition is defined by a mean arterial pressure of less than 65 mm Hg.1-3 To determine the cause of intraoperative hypotension in this patient, the timing relative to the surgery (between induc- tion and surgery, during surgery, or immediately after surgery), patient risk factors, and proce- dural risk factors should all be considered.\n\nTiming of Intraoperative Hypotension Relative to Surgery\nThis patient began to have hypotension during the period between induction of anesthesia and surgery, when the mean arterial pressure de- creased to 46 mm Hg. Hypotension that occurs during this period is most commonly due to the sympatholytic effects of anesthetics, whereas hy- potension that develops during surgery can also be caused by blood loss or reduced venous return resulting from surgical compression.\n\nPatient-Related Risk Factors for Intraoperative Hypotension\nPatient-related risk factors for intraoperative hypotension include age-related physiologic changes, pathophysiological changes due to coexisting conditions, and medication use.3,4 The physiologic increase in arterial stiffness and decreases in intra- vascular volume, baroreceptor reflex, and myocar- dial contractility that occur with older age can result in clinically significant hypotension after the administration of anesthetics; however, such changes would be unlikely causes of hypotension in this 59-year-old patient. In addition, the pa- tient did not have coexisting conditions that are typically associated with intraoperative hypoten- sion, such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, pe- ripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hypothyroid- ism, or adrenal insufficiency.\nCould the patient\u2019s medications have caused\nintraoperative hypotension? Intravascular volume depletion from the use of hydrochlorothiazide or residual blockade of angiotensin II\u2013mediated va- soconstriction might have contributed to a de- crease in blood pressure but would be unlikely to have caused the degree of hypotension that this patient had. She did not take other medica- tions known to contribute to the occurrence of hypotension after induction of anesthesia, such as antiarrhythmic medications, which reduce the heart rate and have a negative inotropic effect.\n\nThe fact that the patient had a gradual develop- ment of hypotension that abated after the admin- istration of ephedrine and phenylephrine argues against an anaphylactic reaction to other medi- cations such as rocuronium and piperacillin\u2013 tazobactam, which were administered during the period of induction of anesthesia.\n\nProcedural Risk Factors for Intraoperative Hypotension\nProcedural risk factors for intraoperative hypo- tension include the type and urgency of surgery, positioning of the patient, blood loss, and type of anesthesic agents administered. Transsphe- noidal hypophysectomy was a planned neurosur- gical procedure, and the hypotension occurred before the procedure began; therefore, blood loss was not a factor in this case. The patient was placed in the supine position rather than the prone position, the latter of which is more commonly associated with hypotension that is due to re- duced venous return.\nCould the patient\u2019s hypotension have resulted\nfrom the administration of the general anesthet- ics? The use of propofol decreases both systemic vascular resistance and myocardial contractility. The use of remifentanil decreases systemic vas- cular resistance and reduces the heart rate. Vola- tile anesthetics used for the maintenance of anes- thesia, such as sevoflurane, also cause a decrease in vascular resistance. Rocuronium \u2014 a neuro- muscular blocking agent \u2014 usually does not af- fect the cardiovascular system, except in the case of an anaphylactic reaction.\nThis patient\u2019s hypotension and ECG changes occurred after the administration of multiple medications to induce general anesthesia and at the start of the maintenance phase of general anesthesia with sevoflurane and infusion of remifentanil but before any painful stimuli were present. The hypotension developed gradually and abated after the administration of ephedrine and phenylephrine. The occurrence of hypoten- sion is not uncommon when the doses of anes- thesics are adjusted for an individual patient. If I had been caring for the patient during the first attempted procedure, I would have attributed the hypotension to a side effect of the anesthesics that was greater than expected. However, the ST-segment elevations require additional investi- gation.\nST-Segment Elevations\nShortly after the onset of hypotension, telemetric monitoring showed ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads and ST-segment depressions and T-wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. These are uncommon intraoperative ECG chang- es, even though intraoperative hypotension is com- mon among patients under general anesthesia. ST-segment elevations are seen with coronary occlusion but can also occur in patients with takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy or coronary vasospasm. No characteristic findings of takot- subo cardiomyopathy were seen on intraoperative TEE, and there was no obvious trigger. I would be very concerned about inferior-wall myocardial ischemia as the cause of the ST-segment eleva- tions. However, additional cardiac investigation revealed only moderate stenosis of the distal left anterior descending coronary artery, and intra- operative ST-segment elevations were attributed to coronary vasospasm.\nSecond Attempted Procedure\nWhen the patient returned to the operating room for the rescheduled procedure 3 weeks later, she had sudden and severe hypotension, and the mean arterial pressure decreased to 37 mm Hg after anesthesia was induced. The abrupt nature of the hypotension that developed after induction of anesthesia before the second attempted procedure is highly suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction.\n\n \nAnaphylaxis\nThe occurrence of anaphylaxis in the operating room is rare. The incidence is estimated to be one case per 10,000 to 20,000 procedures, and neuro- muscular blocking agents such as rocuronium are reported to be the most common cause, account- ing for 50 to 70% of cases. The second most common cause is antibiotic agents.5 This patient was exposed to both a neuromuscular blocking agent and antibiotics before the rapid onset of severe hypotension, which makes anaphylaxis the most likely diagnosis in this case.\nCould anaphylaxis also explain the ST-seg- ment changes seen on intraoperative telemetric monitoring? Coronary vasospasm associated with mast-cell activation due to anaphylaxis has been reported and is a clinical entity called the Kou- nis syndrome.6 Anaphylaxis could explain both the patient\u2019s hypotension and her ST-segment elevations, and I suspect that the diagnostic test that was performed in this case was drug-allergy testing.\n\n\n\n\n ",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Paul E. Hesterberg: I was asked to evaluate this patient for anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a highly likely diagnosis if any of the following three criteria are met: sudden onset of illness with involvement of skin or mucosal tissue and either respiratory symptoms or cardiovascular symptoms; involvement of two or more systems (cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal) after exposure to a likely allergen or trigger; or reduced blood pressure alone after exposure to a known allergen for that patient.7 In patients with perioperative anaphylaxis, cardiovascular symp- toms are common and can be the sole feature of anaphylaxis,8 as was the case in this patient.\nThe diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be made on the basis of serial measurement of the total trypt- ase level in blood samples obtained immediately after or shortly after symptoms begin, followed by measurement of the baseline level (in a blood sample obtained >24 hours after symptom reso- lution). Blood tryptase levels rise rapidly during the first 90 minutes after anaphylaxis, with a plasma half-life of approximately 2 hours.9 Therefore, tryptase levels for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis should ideally be measured within 4 hours after the onset of symptoms.\nIn this patient, serial measurement of the tryptase level was performed in blood samples obtained beginning approximately 15 minutes after the onset of hypotension. The initial blood level of tryptase was 7.4 ng per milliliter (refer- ence value, <11.5), with a peak level of 7.8 ng per milliliter occurring 110 minutes after the onset of symptoms. At 27 hours after the onset of symptoms, the baseline tryptase level was 3.4 ng per milliliter.\nThe minimum acute elevation in the tryptase level that is needed to show clinical significance is determined by a formula (2+1.2\u00d7baseline trypt- ase level)10 that has been validated in the periop- erative setting.11 In this patient, the peak tryptase level exceeded the calculated cutoff (6.1 ng per milliliter), thereby supporting the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.\nThe patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital for skin testing. Skin-prick and intradermal testing were performed at established nonirritating concentrations to evaluate for reac- tions to the suspected culprit medications that were used before the surgical procedures. The medications evaluated included fentanyl, propofol, dexamethasone, rocuronium, lidocaine, midazolam, chlorhexidine, and penicillin derivatives (piperacillin\u2013tazobactam, penicillin, ampicillin, and benzylpenicilloyl polylysine).\nSkin-prick testing was negative for all the medications. Intradermal testing was positive for piperacillin\u2013tazobactam (with the wheal measur- ing 11 mm in diameter and the flare 50 mm in diameter) at a concentration of 1 mg per millili- ter, thus establishing the diagnosis of allergy to piperacillin\u2013tazobactam. All the other tests were negative, including those for the additional peni- cillin derivatives.\n\n\n",
