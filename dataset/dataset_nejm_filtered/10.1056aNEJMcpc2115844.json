    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Suma Babu: A 67-year-old man was evaluated in the sleep clinic at this hospital because of odd behaviors during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and apnea detected on a home sleep study.\nThree years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had vocalizations, including talking and yelling, while sleeping. He also had thrashing movements while sleeping; he fell out of bed more than once and inadvertently hit his wife during these movements.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s wife noticed that the patient had prolonged episodes of daytime sleepiness. During the episodes, he appeared to fall asleep while sitting up and was unresponsive to shaking and loud voices; several hours later, he returned to normal interaction without any interven- tion. The daytime sleepiness was intermittent and fluctuated in severity.\nFour months before the current evaluation, the patient fell asleep while washing dishes. This resulted in a fall and unstable C1 spinal fracture, which required urgent surgical repair. After the surgical repair, melatonin and trazodone were prescribed for insomnia, and abnormal movements during sleep abated. However, vocalizations during sleep \u2014 including singing, talking, and expression of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams \u2014 continued and were most prom- inent in the early morning hours.\nThe patient also had a motor neurologic syndrome that had started before the onset of sleep symptoms, approximately 3.5 years before the current evaluation. Symptoms included progressive gait imbalance with falls, hand clumsiness, hoarse voice, and dysphagia. Serial neurologic examinations, performed over a 3-year period by multiple neuromuscular specialists, revealed slow progression of gener- alized fasciculations and the development of bulbar hyperreflexia, postural insta- bility, and hypophonia, although strength in the arms and legs remained intact. Serial electromyography revealed progressive and widespread involvement of muscles showing chronic reinnervation changes, including eventual involvement of craniobulbar muscles (tongue and masseter muscles).\nDr. Brian Zhao: One year before the current evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine revealed moderate neural foraminal narrowing at the level of C3\u2013C4 bilat- erally and no central canal stenosis. Four months before the current evaluation, MRI of the head revealed a punctate subacute infarct in the left posterior centrum semiovale, chronic infarcts in the left middle frontal gyrus and right cerebel- lum, and nonspecific moderate-to-severe white- matter changes (Fig. 1).\nDr. Babu: Blood tests for paraneoplastic, nutri- tional, and paraproteinemic causes of the pa- tient\u2019s neurologic syndrome were unrevealing. A diagnosis of slowly progressive motor neuron disease was made, and therapy with riluzole was begun. A videofluoroscopic swallowing study revealed severe oropharyngeal dysphagia with laryngeal penetration and silent aspiration; a gastrostomy tube was placed, and tube feeding was initiated.\nThe patient underwent a home sleep-apnea test, which showed sleep-disordered breathing with an apnea\u2013hypopnea index of 20 events per hour; hypoxemia was present at rest while he was breathing ambient air. Severe oxygen de- saturation occurred with frequent respiratory events while he was asleep in the supine position.\nThe patient was then referred to the sleep clinic for an initial evaluation.\nOn evaluation in the sleep clinic, the patient reported that obstructive sleep apnea had been diagnosed on the basis of a home sleep study performed 1 year earlier. Multiple attempts at treatment with continuous positive airway pres- sure (CPAP) had been unsuccessful; there had been difficulty in finding a mask that fit com- fortably.\nIn addition to the sleep and motor neurologic syndrome described previously, the patient\u2019s symptoms included snoring, difficulty with sleep initiation, forgetfulness, poor judgment regard- ing his ability to safely complete physical tasks, urinary urgency and frequency, and night sweats. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was well controlled with insulin and had been complicated by mild, stable, length-depen- dent sensory polyneuropathy; other history includ- ed hyperlipidemia, a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation, depression, orthostatic hypotension, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medications included alprazolam, bupropion, fenofibrate, in- sulin, melatonin, metformin, riluzole, sertraline, and trazodone; there were no known drug aller- gies. The patient lived in New England with his wife. He was a retired engineer. He drank two alcoholic beverages per day. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had died from an unknown cause at an elderly age; his father had died from trauma. One of his brothers had cerebrovascular disease, and another had schizophrenia.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 112/60 mm Hg, the pulse 83 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.2. The patient was awake, alert, and oriented, although his attention was somewhat diminished. He could recall two words out of three. Naming and repetition were intact. The pupils were equally reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full. Facial sensation and strength were normal. Speech was hypophonic and mildly slurred. Eleva- tion of the palate was symmetric, and movement of the tongue was normal. Shoulder shrug was symmetric. Strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups.\n \nDeep-tendon reflexes were brisk in the arms, with mild spasticity in the legs. Plantar responses were normal. Vibratory sensation in the legs was mildly diminished. Results of finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing were normal. There were mild myoclonic movements in both hands. Alter- nating movements were mildly clumsy. Tone was slightly increased in the legs. The gait was on a narrow base and was unsteady; the patient was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Rom- berg test showed truncal titubation.\nA sleep study to determine the appropriate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy was per- formed. In CPAP mode, there was good control of respiratory events. Electromyographic signals revealed elevated muscle tone during rapid-eye- movement (REM) sleep, but there were no ab- normal behaviors.\nTwo weeks later, during a follow-up visit in the neuromuscular clinic, the patient became unresponsive to sternal rub; the vital signs and blood glucose level were normal. He was trans- ported to the emergency department, where he returned to a normal level of consciousness without intervention. Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed frequent intermittent diffuse polymorphic delta slowing of the background, often with bifrontal predominance, but showed no epileptiform abnormalities. The patient was fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. Several weeks after the initiation of treatment, download of CPAP data revealed good effectiveness and adherence.\nHowever, episodes of unresponsiveness increased in frequency and lasted up to 3 hours at a time. During the episodes, the patient\u2019s wife was unable to arouse him despite performing a sternal rub. Modafinil was prescribed, but the episodes did not abate. The patient was admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for long-term monitoring and EEG. During the admission, two episodes of unresponsiveness occurred, during which the patient had a normal blood pressure, heart rate, and glucose level and EEG revealed findings consistent with sleep.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Aleksandar Videnovic: I evaluated this patient when he was referred to the sleep clinic, and I am aware of the final diagnosis in this case.After I was asked to see this 67-year-old man with progressive motor neuron disease, my ini- tial thoughts were centered around the detection of sleep-disordered breathing on a home sleep- apnea test, along with his previous diagnosis of sleep apnea in the context of motor neuron dis- ease and his history of unsuccessful treatment with CPAP.\n\nSleep-Disordered Breathing\nThis patient\u2019s symptoms of snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and daytime sleepiness are supportive of the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing. The findings on an initial home sleep- apnea test had led to the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The timely diagnosis and adequate treatment of sleep-disordered breathing are very important for overall health and quality of life. The standard treatment is PAP, with CPAP being used most frequently. However, patients with neuromuscular disorders may have clinically sig- nificant hypoventilation at night, in addition to apnea or hypopnea, and may receive bilevel PAP treatment.1\nTherefore,  during the initial evaluation, my first question was whether the unsuccessful treat- ment with CPAP was related to coexisting cen- tral sleep apnea that had not been detected on the initial home sleep-apnea test or to a need for bilevel PAP, which would enable oxygenation overnight. I recommended that the patient un- dergo a study in our sleep laboratory to deter- mine the appropriate treatment for his sleep- disordered breathing. The complete sleep study also allowed us to gather information about EEG activity during sleep, sleep stages, arousals from sleep, muscle activity, and unusual behaviors during sleep; a home sleep-apnea test cannot provide such a detailed characterization of sleep.\n\nAbnormal Behaviors during Sleep\nThe patient had additional sleep-related symp- toms, specifically difficulty with sleep initiation and abnormal behaviors while asleep. Difficulty with sleep initiation may be due to sleep-onset insomnia, which has many causes. The patient\u2019s abnormal behaviors during sleep included vocal- izations and movements, along with episodes of falling out of bed during sleep. These behaviors are suggestive of parasomnias, a group of sleep disorders characterized by abnormal behaviors during sleep.\n \n\nParasomnias\nParasomnias are divided into non-REM (NREM) and REM forms, depending on whether the be- haviors emanate from NREM or REM sleep.2,3 Certain clinical characteristics can help to differ- entiate between these two forms. For example, NREM parasomnias \u2014 such as sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals \u2014 often occur in younger patients, mainly happen during the first half of the night, and are associated with a lack of clear dream recall. During NREM parasomnias, the patient is often difficult to arouse, and the associated movements have a rather normal appearance. In this patient, the abnormal behaviors mainly happened during the second half of the night and were characterized by vocalizations and movements that indicated emotions of fear and anger in the context of upsetting dreams. These episodes suggested that the patient was acting out his dreams, which is a hallmark feature of a REM parasomnia known as REM sleep behavior disorder.\n\nREM Sleep Behavior Disorder\nThe loss of muscle atonia that accompanies nor- mal REM sleep is the neurophysiologic signature of REM sleep behavior disorder. Therefore, a sleep study is needed to establish the diagnosis; this was another reason to perform the sleep study in this patient.\nIt is important to emphasize that not every- thing that looks and sounds like REM sleep be- havior disorder is indeed that condition.4 The dif- ferential diagnosis includes nightmares, seizures, psychogenic disorders, malingering, and sleep- disordered breathing. Nightmares are character- ized by unpleasant dream imagery during REM sleep. Dream recall is usually very detailed, sleep may not be interrupted, and vocal and motor behaviors are absent. Seizures, specifically those originating from the frontal or temporal lobes, can be differentiated from REM sleep behavior disorder on the basis of the presence of stereo- typic tonic and dystonic posturing. Video poly- somnography with an extended EEG montage should be performed when epileptic seizures are suspected.\nPsychogenic disorders occur on a background of overnight wakefulness. Psychological testing may be helpful in distinguishing these disorders from REM sleep behavior disorder. Malingering can manifest with a variety of unusual behaviors at night. Video polysomnography is critical in docu- menting whether the events are occurring dur- ing wake time and in confirming the absence of characteristic findings of REM sleep behavior dis- order. Complex behaviors that resemble events of REM sleep behavior disorder can occur during arousal caused by respiratory events in the context of sleep apnea. These pseudo-events of REM sleep behavior disorder resolve with the use of CPAP. The patient underwent a sleep study in CPAP mode, and the sleep-disordered breathing abated. He was subsequently fitted with a mask for CPAP, and treatment was initiated. The sleep study also revealed increased muscle activity dur- ing REM sleep, a finding that confirms the diag- nosis of REM sleep behavior disorder. He was treated with melatonin, one of a few medica- tions used to treat this condition, which resulted\nin decreased dream enactment.\n\nExcessive Sleepiness\nThe patient had fallen asleep while washing dishes. He had several episodes of unresponsive- ness, which were preceded by sleepiness. During these episodes, his wife was unable to arouse him. He would eventually, sometimes after many hours, wake up and be back to normal. There was no mention of involuntary movements, in- continence, or signs of cardiorespiratory distress during the episodes.\nDespite treatment with CPAP, the patient con- tinued to have excessive sleepiness. Because this residual sleepiness could have been due to poor adherence to CPAP or poor effectiveness of CPAP, we checked his CPAP data, which were satisfactory. For the residual sleepiness, he was treated with modafinil, but he did not have a clinically significant increase in alertness.\nThe differential diagnosis of these episodes of unresponsiveness includes seizure disorder, syncope, arrhythmia, a cerebrovascular event, and substance use. Seizures were unlikely to explain these episodes because there was no mo- tor activity and no confusion on arousal. Syncope would not be associated with prolonged unre- sponsiveness. There was no history of findings suggestive of cardiac or cerebrovascular abnor- malities. Although sleepiness is the defining phenotype of narcolepsy, there were no other clinical features suggestive of narcolepsy, and such prolonged episodes of unresponsiveness would be atypical.\n \nBecause the episodes of unresponsiveness were increasing in frequency, the patient was admit- ted to the neurology unit of this hospital for long-term monitoring. During the admission, two episodes occurred. Corresponding EEG monitor- ing revealed findings consistent with sleep, mostly stage 2 (N2) and stage 3 (N3) NREM sleep, without evidence of epileptiform activity.\nIn summary, this patient\u2019s sleep\u2013wake pheno- type consisted of sleep-disordered breathing that was responsive to CPAP treatment, behaviors of REM sleep behavior disorder that were respon- sive to melatonin treatment, and excessive sleep- iness with prolonged episodes of unresponsive- ness (sleep) that did not abate after modafinil treatment.\n\nOther Symptoms\nAs I learned more about the patient\u2019s sleep\u2013wake phenotype, I tried to integrate his symptoms of poor sleep and poor alertness with his other symptoms, specifically the motor neuron pheno- type (predominantly bulbar features with dysar- thria and dysphagia), the autonomic dysfunc- tion, and the decline in balance. Sleep-disordered breathing is commonly associated with motor neuron disease, but REM sleep behavior disorder and autonomic symptoms are not. In addition, his imbalance was unlikely to be related to his motor neuron disease, given that he had normal strength in his arms and legs.\n\nNeurodegenerative Disorders\nREM sleep behavior disorder has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders and is now recog- nized as a prodromal stage of three evolving synucleinopathies: Parkinson\u2019s disease, demen- tia with Lewy bodies, and multiple-system atro- phy.5 REM sleep behavior disorder is exceedingly rare in patients with other neurodegenerative disorders. The combination of this patient\u2019s signs and symptoms did not fit well with any of the three neurodegenerative disorders associated with REM sleep behavior disorder. Parkinsonism is a hallmark of these disorders and was not a fea- ture of this patient\u2019s presentation. Although balance can be affected in any of these disorders, a balance abnormality is unlikely to be present in the early stages and to be rapidly progressive, except in patients with multiple-system atrophy of the cerebellar type. Patients with this condition have an ataxic gait, which was not present in this patient. Autonomic dysfunction is com- mon in patients with multiple-system atrophy, but bulbar symptoms are not. Profound lapses in consciousness from falling asleep are not char- acteristic of any of the three disorders. The ques- tion remained of whether we could fit the pa- tient\u2019s sleep and alertness problems and other neurologic manifestations into a unifying diag- nosis.\n\nAnti-IgLON5 Disease\nAs I considered this question, a disorder that had been described relatively recently came to mind: anti-IgLON5 disease. This disorder is associated with autoantibodies to IgLON5, a neural cell adhesion molecule of unknown function.6 The disorder affects men and women equally and usually develops at 50 to 60 years of age.\nAnti-IgLON5 disease is characterized by a distinctive sleep phenotype and a wide range of associated neurologic symptoms. Sleep pheno- types of the disorder encompass poorly consoli- dated sleep, NREM parasomnia with undifferen- tiated or poorly differentiated NREM sleep early in the sleep episode with vocalizations and move- ments, sleep-disordered breathing, REM sleep behavior disorder, and stridor.7 Daytime sleepi- ness may be present. Other symptoms include dysarthria, dysphagia, gait instability, chorea, eye movement abnormalities, cognitive changes, fasciculations, and myoclonus. Several clinical phenotypes of anti-IgLON5 disease have been recognized: a predominantly sleep-related disor- der, a bulbar syndrome with or without chronic reinnervation changes in arm and leg muscles on electromyography, a progressive supranuclear palsy\u2013like syndrome, a cognitive syndrome, and hyperexcitability with cramps, myoclonus, and fasciculations.7-9\nThe clinical heterogeneity of anti-IgLON5 dis- ease, the rarity of the disease, and the slow progression over a period of months or years are factors that frequently contribute to a delay in diagnosis. The median time from symptom on- set to diagnosis is 2.5 years. The clinical hetero- geneity can also lead to misdiagnosis with one of several conditions, such as isolated sleep- disordered breathing, REM sleep behavior disor- der, motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis, progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple-system atrophy, Huntington\u2019s disease, or stiff-person syndrome. Because the diagnosis of anti-IgLON5 disease is usually delayed, the symptoms are often quite prominent at the time of diagnosis. Death occurs within 3 years after diagnosis in more than 50% of patients.\nCurrent knowledge about treatment effective- ness is limited. Most patients are treated with immunotherapy including glucocorticoids, immu- noglobulins, plasma exchange, rituximab, cyclo- phosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or a combination of these therapies.10 The reported response rate to immunotherapy ranges from 10 to 70%. Combination therapy seems to be more effective than monotherapy.\nThis patient had many of the typical sleep symptoms reported in patients with anti-IgLON5 disease, as well as a combination of neurologic symptoms reported in patients with clinical subtypes of the disease. To establish this diag- nosis, testing for IgLON5 autoantibodies was performed.\n",

    "Diagnosis": "Anti-IgLON5 IgG\u2013associated neurologic disorder",
    "Key testing": "testing for IgLON5 autoantibodies",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Jenny J. Linnoila: Initially, serum paraneoplas- tic antibody panel testing was performed in a neuroimmunology reference laboratory. The test- ing was negative; at that time, tests for IgLON5 autoantibodies were not commercially available. Since then, tests for IgLON5 autoantibodies have become commercially available. These tests have equal sensitivity when performed on serum and on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).8 This is not the case with tests for all neural autoantibodies. For example, testing for anti\u2013N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies, which are associated with the most common form of autoimmune encepha- litis, is more sensitive with CSF than with serum,11 whereas testing for anti\u2013leucine-rich, glioma- inactivated 1 antibodies, which are associated with the second most common form of autoim- mune encephalitis, is more sensitive with serum\nthan with CSF.12\nIn general, when an autoimmune neurologic condition is suspected, good practice involves testing of both serum and CSF with autoantibody panels. Conditions associated with different neural autoantibodies can have overlapping symptoms, especially early on; with the continu- ally broadening array of neural autoantibodies included on panels, it is increasingly difficult to predict ahead of time which antibodies could be detected. Also, it is important to note that many newly identified neural autoantibodies, such as IgLON5 autoantibodies, are not included on paraneoplastic panels (which  should therefore be avoided), but they appear on newer autoim- mune panels, including panels of autoimmune encephalitis\u2013associated antibodies.\nIn this patient, because there was a high clinical suspicion for anti-IgLON5 disease, testing for IgLON5 autoantibodies was performed on a research basis (given that commercial tests were not available at the time), with the serum speci- men from the initial paraneoplastic antibody panel testing. IgLON5 autoantibodies were first identified on a tissue-based indirect immunofluorescence assay. In this assay, the patient\u2019s serum sample was applied to a composite of mouse brain, gut, and kidney tissue. Tissue- binding anti-IgLON5 IgG in the sample was vi- sualized with the use of a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody to human IgG. In the brain, anti-IgLON5 IgG is known to bind to the cere- bellum (to the granular layer more than the molecular layer), midbrain, and thalamus and binds less strongly to the hippocampus and cor- tex.8 It is important to assess the binding pattern on gut and kidney tissue, as well, because anti- IgLON5 IgG also binds to intestinal smooth muscle and renal glomeruli.\nAlthough this tissue-binding pattern is highly suggestive of the presence of IgLON5 autoanti- bodies, the diagnosis of anti-IgLON5 disease must be confirmed by testing the sample with a cell-based assay specific for IgLON5. In this assay, the patient\u2019s serum sample was applied to human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells expressing the IgLON5 protein. Because IgLON5 is a cell adhesion molecule, when it is trans- fected into HEK293 cells, it is expressed on the cell surface. Bound anti-IgLON5 IgG was visual- ized with the use of a fluorescently labeled sec- ondary antibody to human IgG. Both the tissue- based indirect immunofluorescence assay and the cell-based assay of the patient\u2019s serum sam- ple were positive for anti-IgLON5 IgG, and the patient received a diagnosis of anti-IgLON5 IgG\u2013 associated neurologic disorder, or anti-IgLON5 disease.\n",
