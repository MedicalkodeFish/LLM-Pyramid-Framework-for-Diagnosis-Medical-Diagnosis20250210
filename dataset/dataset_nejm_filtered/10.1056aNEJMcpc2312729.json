    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kaitlyn R. Shank (Medicine): A 46-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of hyperglycemia that was refractory to insulin therapy.\nFive years before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus after nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia had devel- oped. At that time, the weight was 113 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 45.6. Treatment with metformin was started, along with subcutaneous insulin glargine at a dose of 10 units daily. The patient had adverse effects associated with metformin, so treat- ment with metformin was discontinued and glipizide was started. During the next\n3.5 years, despite progressive weight loss, the patient\u2019s glycemic control worsened, which resulted in gradual intensification of her glucose-lowering regimen.\nTwo years before the current presentation, the patient moved to the Boston area and established care at a clinic affiliated with another hospital. The weight was 63 kg, and the BMI was 25.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (20 units daily) and glipizide, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 13.2% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Treatment with empagliflozin was started but then stopped because of a urinary tract infection. The dose of subcutaneous insu- lin glargine was increased to 30 units daily, and treatment with subcutaneous insulin lispro, administered at a dose of 10 units three times a day with meals, was added. Treatment with glipizide was stopped, and treatment with glimepiride and pioglitazone was started.\nOne year before the current presentation, the weight was 48 kg, and the BMI was 19.4. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (34 units daily), subcutaneous insulin lispro (15 units three times a day with meals), glimepiride, and pioglitazone, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 14.0%. Anorexia had developed, along with fatigue. Although the patient reported eating very little, the blood glucose levels remained markedly elevated.\nNine months before the current presentation, the weight was 42 kg, and the BMI was 16.9. Medications for diabetes included subcutaneous insulin glargine (46 units daily), subcutaneous insulin lispro (20 units three times a day with meals), glimepiride, and pi- oglitazone, and the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.0%.\nSix months before the current presentation, persistent abdominal pain developed, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Com- puted tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pel- vis, performed after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, reportedly did not show evidence of obstruction, perforation, or abscess. The abdominal pain was attributed to gastropare- sis; treatment with gabapentin, metoclopramide, and oxycodone was started. During the hospital- ization, the patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia without diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. The gly- cated hemoglobin level was 15.5%. Testing was negative for antibodies to glutamic acid decarbox- ylase, islet antigen 2, and zinc transporter 8. A diagnosis of lipodystrophy was considered. Treat- ment with human regular U-500 insulin, given in daily doses of 250 units with breakfast and 200 units each with lunch and dinner, was started; treatment with subcutaneous insulin glargine and subcutaneous insulin lispro was stopped. The pa- tient was discharged home. Subsequent to this hospitalization, a gastric-emptying study report- edly showed normal emptying at 1 hour.\nTwo months before the current presentation,\nthe abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was again admitted to the other hospital. Her hyperglycemia was initially treated with contin- uous intravenous insulin at doses of up to 40 units per hour. When the blood glucose level improved, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped. Treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was then resumed at an increased dose (550 units each with breakfast and lunch and 450 units with dinner); treatment with iso- phane insulin, also known as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, was started at a dose of 80 units twice a day. The abdominal pain subsided with improved glycemic control, and the patient was discharged home.\nOver the course of the 2 months between\nhospital discharge and the current presentation, the patient had five additional admissions to the other hospital because of abdominal pain and hyperglycemia. During each admission, the hy- perglycemia was treated with high-dose  intrave-\n \n\nnous insulin, the abdominal pain abated with improved blood glucose levels, and the patient was discharged home. During one admission, endoscopy was performed and reportedly re- vealed erosive gastritis and duodenitis due to infection with Helicobacter pylori, for which the patient was treated with amoxicillin, clarithro- mycin, bismuth subsalicylate, and pantoprazole. Nine days before the current presentation, the abdominal pain worsened, and the patient was transported by ambulance to the emergency de- partment of the other hospital. Treatment with intravenous insulin was initiated, and the pa- tient was admitted to the hospital. On the sec- ond hospital day, treatment with intravenous insulin was stopped, and treatment with human regular U-500 insulin was resumed at an in- creased dose of 650 units each with breakfast and lunch and 600 units with dinner; treatment with NPH insulin was also restarted at a dose of 80 units twice a day. She was transferred to this\nhospital for further care.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient re- ported constant epigastric abdominal pain. She also reported that she had been administering her subcutaneous insulin medications at home without missed doses and confirmed that she had been rotating the injection sites on her ab- domen. Other medical history included depres- sion, as well as anemia and leukopenia; a bone marrow biopsy performed 7 months earlier re- vealed mild-to-moderate fibrosis with patchy myxoid degeneration. She had numbness and tingling in the hands and feet that had begun 9 months before the current presentation. Her menses had stopped 14 months before the cur- rent presentation. Other medications included acetaminophen, fluoxetine, gabapentin, glipizide, hydromorphone, lorazepam, mirtazapine, oxyco- done, pancrelipase, pantoprazole, and piogli- tazone. She had no known drug allergies. The patient was Black and lived in Boston with her husband and children; she had previously worked as a chef but was not working at the time of the current presentation. She rarely drank alcohol or smoked marijuana and had never smoked to- bacco; she did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes, and her father had liver disease.\nOn examination, the temporal  temperature\nwas 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 108/78 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 100% while the patient was breathing ambi- ent air. The weight was 42 kg, and the BMI was\n17.0. The patient appeared cachectic with a dif- fuse absence of body fat and muscle mass. Her face had acromegaly-like features, including broad- ening of the nose and thickening of the lips (Fig. 1). Acanthosis nigricans was present, most notably in the neck and axillae. She had skin tags on the face and neck, and vitiligo was present on the ears and on the fingers of the right hand. The abdomen was soft, nondistended, and diffusely tender on palpation, without rebound or guard- ing; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was skin breakdown in the legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nLaboratory testing showed a fasting blood\nglucose level of 311 mg per deciliter (17.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deci- liter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]) and a C-peptide level of 12.1 ng per milliliter (reference range,\n1.1 to 4.4). Blood levels of cholesterol, triglycer- ides, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine ami- notransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total biliru- bin, total complement, C3, and C4 were normal. The blood level of leptin was undetectable, and the blood level of adiponectin was 24.5 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 2.9 to 30.4). A screen- ing test for human immunodeficiency virus was negative. Testing for antibodies to nuclear anti- gens was positive at a titer of 1:320 with a ho- mogeneous pattern; testing for antibodies to double-stranded DNA was negative. Serum pro- tein electrophoresis showed a normal pattern with a mild diffuse increase in the gamma globulin level. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were per- formed.\nDr. Leo L. Tsai: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, revealed a near-complete absence of both visceral and subcutaneous fat, with multiple skin folds reflecting a clinically significant lack of fat (Fig. 2). There was no bowel dilatation. The pancreas was atrophic, a finding commonly seen in patients with chronic insulin- dependent diabetes.1 There were bilateral, non- obstructing renal stones measuring up to 3 mm in diameter. The attenuation level of the liver was 58 Hounsfield units (HU), which is not con- sistent with hepatic steatosis (which is usually defined by an attenuation level of <40 HU).2 A nonspecific, round 3.3-cm hypodense lesion at the upper aspect of the spleen was noted.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs.\nClinical photographs obtained at the time of admission to this hospital show acromegaly\u2011like features on the face, including broadening of the nose, thickening of the lips, and skin tags (Panel A); extensive acanthosis nigricans involving the neck and axillae (Panel B); and skin breakdown, muscle atrophy, and low fat mass in the legs (Panel C).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lindsay T. Fourman: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagno- sis. The differential diagnosis presented here reflects my initial assessment of the patient at the time of her transfer to our hospital. This 46-year-old woman had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 5 years before the current pre- sentation. In the time between the diagnosis and the current presentation, the doses of exogenous insulin that were needed to lower her blood glu- cose level progressively increased. This impaired response to glucose-lowering medications is consistent with insulin resistance.\nPhysiologic insulin secretion approximates 0.4\nto 1 unit per kilogram of body weight per day.3 An exogenous insulin requirement greater than 2 or 3 units of insulin per kilogram per day is classi- fied as severe insulin resistance.4 On transfer to this hospital, this patient had a strikingly high insulin requirement, which exceeded 50 units per kilogram per day.\n\nInsulin Pseudoresistance\nIn patients with suspected insulin resistance, I first consider potential mimics. Poor adherence to insulin therapy or excessive carbohydrate con- sumption may masquerade as reduced insulin sensitivity. In addition, when insulin is adminis- tered subcutaneously, scar tissue or soft-tissue edema at injection sites may result in decreased insulin delivery to peripheral tissues.5 Further- more, the use of exogenous insulin that is expired or not stored properly (e.g., exposed to sunlight or not refrigerated) may reduce efficacy. This patient received high doses of insulin both intravenously and subcutaneously while in a monitored hospital setting, which made insulin pseudoresistance an unlikely diagnosis. In addition, she had classic signs and symptoms of insulin resistance that oc- cur due to cross-reactivity of high circulating levels of insulin with the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor, including acanthosis nigricans, skin tags, and acromegaly-like features (Fig. 1).4\n\nPhysiologic and Pathophysiological Conditions\nPuberty, pregnancy, and older age are risk factors associated with insulin resistance, but none of these applied to this patient. Insulin resistance can also occur in association with pathophysiological conditions, such as acute stress (e.g., trauma or sepsis), end-organ damage (e.g., cirrhosis or ure- mia), weight gain, obesity, or starvation.6 This pa- tient had obesity when she received her initial dia- betes diagnosis. However, obesity was an unlikely explanation for this patient\u2019s presentation because her insulin requirements continued to escalate despite profound weight loss and were highest when her BMI was in the underweight range.\n\nMedications\nSpecific medications may contribute to a reduced responsiveness to the glucose-lowering effect of insulin, including glucocorticoids, atypical anti- psychotic agents, and antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus infection.7 How- ever, this patient did not receive any of these medications.\n\nEndocrine Disorders\nGlucagonoma, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, and acro- megaly are endocrine disorders involving hor- monal hypersecretion that can lead to insulin resistance.6\nGlucagonoma is a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreatic islets that secretes glucagon. Hyper- glycemia and weight loss are common findings in patients with glucagonoma. However, necro- lytic migratory erythema, a characteristic rash present in more than half of patients with glu- cagonoma, was not seen in this case.8 In addi- tion, the plasma level of glucagon was normal.\nCushing\u2019s syndrome is characterized by a con- stellation of signs and symptoms associated with prolonged exposure to elevated levels of circu- lating cortisol, which may occur in patients who receive glucocorticoids or have pituitary or adre- nal tumors. However, the typical findings as- sociated with Cushing\u2019s syndrome \u2014 such as weight gain with central adiposity, rounded facies, fatigue, proximal muscle weakness, easy bruis- ing, and violaceous striae \u2014 were not present in this case.\nAcromegaly, a condition resulting from exces- sive secretion of growth hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland, is most often caused by a pituitary tumor. Although this patient pre- sented with some facial features consistent with acromegaly (i.e., broadening of the nose and thickening of the lips), there was no acral en- largement, joint pain, headache, or sweating, all of which are characteristic of this condition. In addition, the serum level of IGF-1 was not elevat- ed in this patient.\nMenstrual irregularities may develop in pa- tients with Cushing\u2019s syndrome or acromegaly. However, I suspected that this patient\u2019s amenor- rhea was most likely related to her low BMI. Thyrotoxicosis and pheochromocytoma are oth- er endocrine disorders associated with insulin resistance, although this patient\u2019s clinical pre- sentation was not suggestive of these diagnoses.\nLipodystrophic Syndromes\nLipodystrophy refers to a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by a selective lack of subcutaneous adipose tissue accompanied by insulin resistance.9,10 Lipodystrophic syndromes can be classified by the extent of deficient fat (generalized vs. partial) and the cause (genetic vs. acquired). In cases of partial lipodystrophy, areas of lipohypertrophy may also be present, involving sites such as the abdomen, neck, and chin. Insulin resistance develops in patients with lipodystrophy as a result of elevated circulating free fatty acids and the accumulation of ectopic fat. Low fat stores also may lead to low circulat- ing levels of the adipokine leptin, which further contributes to insulin resistance.9\nWhen evaluating a patient with severe insulin resistance, it is important to differentiate lipo- dystrophy from cachexia due to poorly controlled diabetes.9 Insulin is an anabolic hormone, and thus impaired insulin signaling in patients with insulin resistance may lead to catabolism of both muscle and fat. By contrast, patients with lipo- dystrophy have reduced body fat with preserva- tion of muscle mass. On examination, this patient had muscle atrophy and low body fat, findings consistent with cachexia. However, a lack of subcutaneous fat accompanied by a low circulat- ing level of leptin can occur in patients with either of these conditions. Thus, lipodystrophy remained a diagnostic possibility in my evalua- tion of this patient.\nPrimary Insulin-Signaling Defects\nPrimary insulin-signaling defects are rare genetic or acquired disorders in which insulin signaling is directly impaired upstream, at the level, or downstream of the insulin receptor (Fig. 3).\nPrimary insulin-signaling defects that occur upstream of the insulin receptor (prereceptor insulin-signaling defects) are caused by insulin antibodies that bind to circulating insulin.11 Insulin antibodies impair the ability of insulin to interact with its receptor, which leads to postprandial hyperglycemia. Fasting hypogly- cemia may also occur owing to the gradual dissociation of insulin from its antibodies. Acanthosis nigricans does not typically develop in patients with insulin antibodies, since bound insulin does not cross-react with the IGF-1 re- ceptor. This patient had severe acanthosis ni- gricans without fasting hypoglycemia, which made prereceptor insulin resistance an unlikely diagnosis.\nPrimary insulin-signaling defects that occur at the level of the insulin receptor (receptor-level insulin-signaling defects) are caused by muta- tions in the receptor or by antibodies that target the receptor.4,10 Conditions that affect the insulin receptor may manifest at birth as autosomal re- cessive syndromes associated with growth and developmental disorders. Alternatively, heterozy- gous or homozygous mutations in the insulin\n \nreceptor may result in type A insulin resistance syndrome, which often becomes clinically ap- parent during or after adolescence. Type B insu- lin resistance syndrome is a rare disorder char- acterized by the presence of antibodies to the insulin receptor. This disorder most commonly occurs in middle-aged Black women who have other autoimmune features or lymphoprolifera- tive disorders.12\nPrimary insulin-signaling defects that occur downstream of the insulin receptor (postrecep- tor insulin-signaling defects) rarely arise from mutations involving the insulin-signaling cas- cade.4 More commonly, postreceptor insulin re- sistance is caused by functional inhibition of intermediates within the insulin-signaling path- way (such as by posttranslational modification), which underlies the classic form of insulin resis- tance observed in patients with conditions such as obesity and lipodystrophy.13,14\nThis patient\u2019s demographic characteristics and autoimmune profile were suggestive of a diagnosis of type B insulin resistance syndrome due to insulin-receptor antibodies. However, lipodys- trophy remained a diagnostic consideration in this case.\nDistinguishing Type B Insulin Resistance Syndrome from Lipodystrophy\nIn the liver, the insulin-signaling cascade branch- es downstream of its receptor to form one path- way that suppresses gluconeogenesis and another pathway that activates de novo lipogenesis (Fig. 3). When insulin resistance is caused by a postre- ceptor insulin-signaling defect, as in the case of lipodystrophy, the suppression of gluconeogen- esis is selectively impaired, whereas activation of de novo lipogenesis remains intact.13 The inability of insulin to suppress gluconeogenesis results in hyperglycemia. Meanwhile, upregulation of de novo lipogenesis by high circulating levels of insulin leads to hepatic steatosis. Accordingly, hepatic steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia are common features of postreceptor insulin resis- tance in patients with lipodystrophy.9,15 By con- trast, receptor-level insulin resistance, as in the case of type B insulin resistance, results in global impairment of insulin signaling downstream of its receptor. Suppression of gluconeogenesis and activation of de novo lipogenesis both fail to oc- cur in response to insulin, which leads to the rare combination of insulin-resistant diabetes, normal hepatic fat content, and a normal plas- ma level of triglycerides.13,15 Receptor-level insulin resistance also results in high or high-normal circulating levels of adiponectin and sex hormone\u2013 binding globulin, which are typically suppressed by partially intact insulin signaling in postrecep- tor insulin resistance.\nThis patient had normal hepatic fat content and a normal triglyceride level, as well as high- normal levels of adiponectin and sex hormone\u2013 binding globulin. These findings made a diag- nosis of lipodystrophy unlikely and instead favored a diagnosis of type B insulin resistance syndrome due to insulin-receptor antibodies.\n",

In this case, at a serum dilution of 1:5, there was a strong positive signal for the presence of insulin-receptor antibodies (Fig. 4). This find- ing, in combination with this patient\u2019s clinical presentation, is consistent with a diagnosis of type B insulin resistance syndrome, a condition that was first reported in 1976.18\nUntil recently, there were no commercially available assays for the measurement of insulin- receptor antibodies. However, in 2023, a new assay was developed that was based on a bridge assay detection format, which captures insulin-receptor antibodies between an insulin receptor contain- ing a C-terminal peptide tag bound in the solid phase and a soluble insulin receptor with lucif- erase encoded at its C-terminus.19 The rarity of type B insulin resistance syndrome may present challenges for the widespread availability of such an assay, but this assay represents a potentially substantial advance in facilitating the diagnosis of type B insulin resistance syndrome \u2014 a serious but treatable disorder.\n\nFigure 4. Western Blot Analysis.\nLysate from CL6 cells stably expressing the human in\u2011 sulin receptor was added to a sample of the patient\u2019s serum in addition to positive and negative controls. The Western blot image analysis confirmed the pres\u2011 ence of insulin\u2011receptor antibodies in the patient\u2019s serum. The insulin receptor \u03b2 subunit was detected at 95kDa with the use of immunoprecipitation, shown as dark bands in the lanes for positive controls (+ve ctrl 1:5 and 1:50) and patient serum and as a faint band in the lysate\u2011only lane. The standard lanes contained pro\u2011 tein markers of a known size. The blank lanes contained diluent only. The positive control lanes contained serum from a patient who had had a diagnosis of type B insulin resistance syndrome; the serum was diluted at a ratio of 1:5 or 1:50 and incubated with recombinant human insulin receptors. The negative control (\u2212ve ctrl) lane contained serum specimens from a patient who had not been found to have type B insulin resistance syn\u2011 drome; the serum was diluted at a ratio of 1:5 and incubated with recombinant human insulin receptors. The lysate\u2011only lane contained lysate from CL6 cells stably expressing the human insulin receptor.\n",
