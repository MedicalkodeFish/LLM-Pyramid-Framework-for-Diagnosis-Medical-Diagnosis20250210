    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. John H. Stone: A 59-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of headache and progressive neurologic dysfunction.\nTen months before this evaluation, daily fever with a temperature of up to 38.9\u00b0C, chills, myalgias, drenching night sweats, and pressure and pain in both cheeks and ears developed. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physi- cian. He reported rhinorrhea and fatigue but no headache, pharyngitis, or dyspnea, and he had no sick contacts. On examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 112/64 mm Hg, and the oxy- gen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. He was ill-appearing, and the maxillary sinuses were tender on palpation; the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 463,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 400,000); the re- mainder of the complete blood count and the differential count were normal. Amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was prescribed.\nDuring the next 2 weeks, fever, night sweats, and sinus and facial pain contin- ued. Diffuse headache developed, along with jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, and hip and shoulder stiffness. The patient was evaluated again by his primary care physician. He reported weight loss of 2 kg, episodic double vision, and hip pain that caused difficulty in standing and climbing stairs. The physical examination was unchanged. Urinalysis was normal. A test for heterophile antibody and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative, as were screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus and Lyme disease. Chest radi- ography and computed tomography of the sinuses were normal. The patient was referred to a rheumatologist at another hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported persistent fever and frontal, temporal, and maxillary headache. There were palpable temporal artery pulses without tenderness; the remainder of the examination was normal, including the absence of bruits on aus- cultation of large vessels. The erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate was 108 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), the blood level of C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0), the blood level of rheumatoid factor 24 IU per milliliter (reference value, <14), and  the blood level of aldolase 8.4 IU per milliliter (reference value, <8.1). Biopsy of the right tem- poral artery was performed. Histologic examina- tion of the biopsy specimen reportedly showed no granulomas, but evidence of chronic inflam- mation of the temporal artery and fibrinoid ne- crosis of an adjacent small vessel were noted.\nA diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis was made, and treatment with prednisone was started. With- in a few days after initiation of treatment, head- ache, fever, jaw pain, and joint stiffness abated. The next month, an attempt to lower the predni- sone dose resulted in recurrent severe headache with scalp tenderness, jaw pain, and hip stiff- ness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour and the C-reactive protein level 84 mg per liter. Treatment with weekly subcutane- ous administration of tocilizumab was initiated. During the next 6 weeks, another attempt was made to taper the prednisone dose. After 1 week of treatment at  a  lower  prednisone dose, and 5 months after the development of initial symp- toms (5 months before the current evaluation), the patient reported headache that he described as \u201cthe worst headache of my life,\u201d with associ- ated jaw pain and diplopia. The pain  was worst at the right frontal and maxillary areas, but the entire right side of the face, including the scalp and neck, was affected. The patient returned to the other hospital for evaluation. He was found to have palsies of the third and sixth cranial nerves on the right side. The patient was admit- ted to the neurology service at the other hospi- tal. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing revealed a slightly elevated myeloperoxi- dase  antibody  level,  at  1.9  U  (reference value,\n<1.0), but antibodies to proteinase 3 were not\ndetected. Blood levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed abnormal expansion and enhancement of the right cavernous sinus that ex- tended into the right superior orbital fissure and right pterygopalatine fossa, as well as abnormal pachymeningeal thickening and  enhancement  of the adjacent right middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Fig. 1C and 1D) showed mass- like pachymeningeal thickening and enhance- ment in the upper cervical spinal canal at C2\u2013C4 with an anterior predominance as well as more circumferentially at the cervicothoracic junction (C6\u2013T3) with a posterior predominance, with resultant canal narrowing and mild cord com- pression at C7\u2013T2. There was no spinal cord edema.\nDr. John Stone: A lumbar puncture was performed; an opening pressure was not recorded. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose level was 65 mg per deciliter (3.6 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 80 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.4 mmol per liter]), and the protein level was 126 mg per deciliter (reference range, 15 to 45), with 2 red cells per microliter and 8 white cells per micro- liter (of which 79% were lymphocytes). Gram\u2019s staining and cultures of the CSF were negative. Tests for CSF myelin basic protein, angiotensin- converting enzyme, cryptococcal antigen, cysti- cercosis IgG, mycobacterial DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and borrelia DNA were negative, as was a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. Cytologic analysis of the CSF showed a mixed population of mononuclear cells with rare plasma cells. The CSF immunoglobulin level was 19 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0 to 6), with 5 oligo- clonal bands.\nOn the eighth hospital day, a meningeal biopsy was performed. Treatment with high-dose prednisone was started, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 2 weeks, the patient continued taking the prednisone, but the facial and head pain worsened. He was readmit- ted to the other hospital to receive 3 days of treatment with parenteral pulse-dose methyl- prednisolone.\nPathological examination of the meningeal biopsy specimen revealed a densely fibrotic, chronically inflamed dura mater with large num- bers of CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ T lym- phocytes and with focal collections of CD20+ B lymphocytes. There was a large number of poly- clonal plasma cells with more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field. Storiform fibrosis was present, and elastin staining revealed obliterative venulitis. Some of the inflammatory foci were angiocentric, but no vasculitis was present. There were rare foci of fibrinoid necro- sis and some neutrophils, with rare giant cells but no granulomas. A diagnosis of IgG4-related disease was made, and rituximab was adminis- tered. Two days after the first rituximab dose, a pulmonary embolism was diagnosed, and treatment with apixaban was initiated. Two weeks later, repeat imaging was obtained to evaluate the treatment response.\nDr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head (Fig.  2A and 2B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed increased abnormal enhancement in the right cavernous sinus and right middle cranial fossa and new ab- normal enhancement in the left cavernous sinus and adjacent left middle cranial fossa. MRI of the cervical spine (Fig. 2C and 2D) also showed progression in the extent and thickness of the ventral and dorsal pachymeningeal thickening and enhancement. There was also progression of the canal stenosis, which had become severe, and cord compression at the C7 level. There was no cord signal abnormality.\nDr. John Stone: The patient received a second infusion of rituximab, as well as treatment with oral dexamethasone. Three weeks later, and 7 months after the development of initial symptoms (3 months before the current evaluation), the pa- tient was admitted to the other hospital because of worsening headache, nausea, and vomiting. Examination was notable for new sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear and deviation of the tongue to the left. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Treatment with dexamethasone was continued, and the patient was discharged home. Three weeks after placement of the ventriculo- peritoneal shunt, the patient was admitted again to the other hospital because of streptococcal infection. Two months after discharge, and 10 months after the development of initial symp- toms, he was seen in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for additional evaluation.\nThe patient had a history of migraines, hyper- tension, and a heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation. Medications included apixaban, ba- clofen, dexamethasone, furosemide, gabapentin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. He was a retired businessman and lived with his wife. He drank one glass of wine weekly and had quit smoking more than 40 years before the current evaluation. His maternal grandfather had died from a rup- tured aortic aneurysm.\nThe temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/79 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square  of the height in meters) was 25.8. The scalp hair was thin. He had cushingoid facies; acne on the face, back, and chest; striae on the flanks; and proximal muscle weakness of the arms and legs. There was no scalp or temporal tenderness. He had no tongue lesions or oral ulcers, and the nasal examination showed no crusting. Extra- ocular movements were intact. There was no arthritis. The chest, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were normal. The complete blood count and the differential count were normal,  as was a urinalysis. The erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate was 52 mm per hour and the C-reac- tive protein level 5 mg per liter. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed an IgM level of 22 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334) and nor- mal levels of IgG and IgA. ANCA testing was negative.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "Pachymeningitis;Giant-Cell Arteritis;IgG4-Related Disease;Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. David Jayne: This 59-year-old man\u2019s illness began with fever, sweats, rhinorrhea, and maxil- lary tenderness, and he was presumably treated for sinusitis. The development of headache, jaw soreness, scalp tenderness, polymyalgia, diplo- pia, and marked elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of C-reactive protein prompted a temporal artery biopsy that led to a diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis and treatment with prednisone. After an initial re- sponse, symptoms returned when prednisone was tapered to a lower dose. Despite the addi- tion of tocilizumab treatment, headache persisted when prednisone was again tapered. Third and sixth cranial nerve palsies developed, and the patient was noted to have a low positive titer on ANCA testing, directed against myeloperoxidase. Evidence of pachymeningitis was observed on MRI, and a meningeal biopsy revealed many IgG4+ plasma cells; these findings prompted a change in the diagnosis to IgG4-related disease.\n\nPachymeningitis\nPachymeningitis describes a disease that is char- acterized by thickening of the intracranial dura mater, which on MRI can show gadolinium en- hancement caused by inflammation. Pachymen- ingitis is a central feature of this patient\u2019s pre- sentation; it accounts for the headache, cranial neuropathies, and spinal stenosis, and it pro- gressed despite substantial immunosuppression with rituximab and glucocorticoid therapy. The differential diagnosis for pachymeningitis in- cludes primary vasculitis syndromes, nonvascu- litic chronic inflammatory disease, infection, and cancer. Evaluation of extracranial features of a patient\u2019s disease and histologic examination of a meningeal biopsy specimen are necessary to determine the diagnosis that is responsible for the syndrome.1,2\nInfection and cancer have been ruled out in\nthis patient on the basis of appropriate micro- biologic and histologic studies, and there are no clinical or histologic features supportive of his- tiocytosis. The diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disease includes the integration of clinical and radiologic features with serologic tests and pathological examination of tissue-biopsy speci- mens, as well as careful observation over time with  respect  to  treatment  response.  Many inflammatory diseases do not have diagnostic criteria, but consensus definitions and classifi- cation systems can aid in diagnosis.3,4 This pa- tient had received diagnoses of two different inflammatory diseases: giant-cell arteritis and IgG4-related disease. I will begin by considering each of these in more detail.\n\nGiant-Cell Arteritis\nThis patient\u2019s headache, scalp tenderness, jaw soreness, polymyalgia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are consistent with the diagnosis of giant-cell arteritis. The temporal artery biopsy reportedly revealed evidence of chronic inflammation, which further supported but did not confirm the diagnosis. Although this patient meets the 1990 American College of Rheumatology classifica- tion criteria for giant-cell arteritis,5 I do not think that giant-cell arteritis is the correct diag- nosis. The relapsing course despite treatment with tocilizumab and prednisone would be un- usual for giant-cell arteritis. In addition, the findings of the temporal artery biopsy included necrotizing arteritis of a small adjacent blood vessel, and necrosis is not a typical feature of giant-cell arteritis.\n\nIgG4-Related Disease\nIgG4-related disease has a diverse range of clini- cal presentations, and histologic features include dense, storiform fibrosis with IgG4+ plasma cells and obliterative venulitis.6 Circulating IgG4 levels are often elevated. The levels of IgG sub- classes were normal in this patient, although they were measured after months of treatment with glucocorticoid therapy, which may have af- fected the results. Pachymeningitis is a known feature of IgG4-related disease.2 However, the severity of this patient\u2019s inflammatory presenta- tion, which was marked by fever and night sweats, would be highly unusual for IgG4-related disease, as would the patient\u2019s poor response to both oral and intravenous glucocorticoids. Pa- tients with IgG4-related disease typically have a good response to prednisone.\nThe results of this patient\u2019s temporal artery and meningeal biopsies are also helpful when considering the diagnosis of IgG4-related dis- ease. IgG4+ plasma cells would have been expect- ed to be present in the temporal artery\u2013biopsy specimen if IgG4-related disease were affecting the temporal artery, but these cells were not seen in this patient\u2019s specimen.7 The meningeal biopsy revealed storiform fibrosis, obliterative venulitis, and IgG4+ plasma cells, but these findings are\n \nnot diagnostic of IgG4-related disease. Indeed, the findings of fibrinoid necrosis in the tempo- ral artery biopsy and neutrophilic infiltration, giant cells, and necrosis in the meningeal biopsy argue strongly against IgG4-related disease. Each of these histologic features is part of the exclu- sion criteria for IgG4-related disease outlined in the 2019 American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism clas- sification criteria.8,9\nThese findings instead suggest the possibility of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), one type of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Many case reports have suggested diagnostic overlap between ANCA-associated vasculitis and IgG4-related dis- ease, but systematic observational studies have been able to differentiate between the diseases.10 When features of both diseases occur simultane- ously, it is  more  likely that the true diagnosis is one or the other, rather than the presence of both diseases in the same patient.\n\nGranulomatosis with Polyangiitis\nGPA has been defined as a necrotizing, granulo- matous inflammation of small and medium- sized blood vessels of the respiratory tract that often also affects the kidneys.11 The inflamma- tory features seen in this patient are consistent with this diagnosis, and both facial pain and maxillary tenderness are also common with GPA. The absence of findings in the lungs and kidneys would make this an unusual case of GPA, but such cases occur. Presentations that are limited to the head and neck, including hy- pertrophic pachymeningitis, are well described in patients with GPA.\nGPA is closely associated with one of two autoantibodies directed against neutrophil cyto- plasmic antigens: either proteinase 3 or myelo- peroxidase. This patient had a positive test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase, albeit at a rela- tively low level. ANCA assays remain poorly standardized, and their diagnostic performance depends on both the pretest probability of dis- ease and laboratory expertise.12 In addition, the titer in this patient may have been reduced by the preceding 6 weeks of treatment with pred- nisone.\nThe necrotizing inflammation of the small artery that was seen in the temporal artery biopsy and the presence of giant cells with areas of necrosis in the meningeal biopsy are consistent with GPA. Moreover, infiltrations of IgG4+ plasma cells are often detected in this disease.13 GPA is initially responsive to glucocorticoids, but remission requires treatment with either the cytotoxic drug cyclophosphamide or the B-cell\u2013 depleting antibody rituximab. Rituximab takes time to work and would not yet have been effec- tive within the 2 weeks after treatment, when this patient\u2019s radiologic findings had progressed and clinical deterioration had occurred.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. James R. Stone: The specimens from the tempo- ral artery and meningeal biopsies that were performed at the other hospital were reviewed. The temporal artery\u2013biopsy specimen (Fig. 3) showed necrotizing vasculitis involving a branch artery. The main temporal artery was not in- volved. There was both fibrinoid necrosis and luminal thrombosis of the branch artery. Focal involvement of small veins, which indicated a small-vessel vasculitis, was also observed. Im- munohistochemical staining showed that the inflammatory infiltrate was composed primarily of CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells, and CD68+ macrophages.\nAlthough the temporal artery biopsy  showed\nvasculitis, and giant-cell arteritis is by far the most common form of vasculitis to affect this site, in up to 6% of temporal artery biopsies that confirm the presence of vasculitis, the vasculitis is due to a form other than giant-cell arteritis.14-16 The use of the term \u201ctemporal arteritis\u201d to de- scribe temporal artery biopsies with evidence of vasculitis should be avoided because this con- struct inadvertently implies giant-cell arteritis.Several histologic features of the temporal arterybiopsy  specimen  from  this  patient  were  unusual for giant-cell arteritis: the finding of ar- teritis being confined primarily to a branch artery, the presence of both fibrinoid necrosis and luminal thrombosis, and the degree of plasma- cell infiltration. Moreover, venous involvement implicates a small-vessel vasculitis (e.g., an ANCA-associated vasculitis or an immune complex\u2013 mediated vasculitis).17 Although IgG4-related disease can be associated with vasculitis in both small and large vessels, necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis is not a feature of IgG4-related dis- ease.7,18 Taken together, the findings of the tem- poral artery biopsy were not consistent with giant-cell arteritis or IgG4-related disease.\nThe meningeal biopsy specimen showed a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate that was similar to that seen in the temporal artery\u2013biopsy specimen; the infiltrate was composed primarily of CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD138+ plasma cells, and CD68+ macrophages (Fig. 4). Relatively few CD20+ B lymphocytes were present, and the plasma cells showed polytypic expression for kappa and lambda immunoglobin light chains (not shown). There were occasional multinucle- ated giant cells, which indicated granulomatous inflammation, as well as areas with neutrophils and necrosis (often termed microabscesses). Stori- form fibrosis and obliterative venulitis, which were reported at the other hospital and can be seen in some cases of IgG4-related disease, were not identified. Staining for microorganisms was negative. There were more than 100 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-power field; 49% of the IgG+ plasma cells showed expression of IgG4. The diffuse nature of the meningeal infiltrate was not consistent with a focused vasculitis such as giant-cell arteritis. The degree of IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration would meet the criteria for IgG4-related disease in the appropriate con- text; however, giant cells and neutrophilic micro- abscesses are not features of IgG4-related dis- ease.18 Diffuse inflammation with giant cells and neutrophilic microabscesses are features of GPA.19 Biopsy specimens from patients with GPA may also show a high degree of tissue infiltra- tion by IgG4+ plasma cells.20 Taken together, this case of vasculitis affecting both the tempo- ral artery and the meninges is most consistent with the diagnosis of GPA.\n",
