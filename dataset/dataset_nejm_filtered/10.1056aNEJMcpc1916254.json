    "Primary Symptom": "A 29-Year-Old Man with High Blood Pressure, Renal Insufficiency, and Hematuria",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Sahir Kalim: A 29-year-old white man was evaluated at the nephrology clinic of this hospital because of hypertension, renal insufficiency, and hematuria.\nEight months before the current evaluation, at a physical examination per- formed for employment, the patient was told he had high blood pressure; no further evaluation was performed. One month before the current evaluation, he was seen by his primary care physician at another institution for a routine physical examination. A review of systems was reportedly negative. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C,  the  heart  rate  67  beats  per  minute,  the  blood  pressure  175/100  mm  Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. Examination of the skin revealed a rash consistent with rosacea and a small cyst on the back; the remainder of the examination was normal. The blood level of hemoglobin was\n10.7 g per deciliter (normal range, 14.0 to 18.0), hematocrit 31.5% (normal range,\n40.0 to 54.0), urea nitrogen 37 mg per deciliter (13.2 mmol per liter; normal range, 9 to 20 mg per deciliter [3.2 to 7.1 mmol per liter]), creatinine 3.1 mg per deciliter (274 \u03bcmol per liter; normal range, 0.7 to 1.3 mg per deciliter [62 to 115 \u03bcmol per liter]), potassium 4.5 mmol per liter (normal range, 3.5 to 5.1), albumin 3.7 g per deciliter (normal range, 3.3 to 5.0), and glucose 86 mg per deciliter (4.8 mmol per liter; normal range, 70 to 99 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.5 mmol per liter]). A screening test for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 was negative. Amlodipine therapy was started.\nSix days later, dark urine developed. After 4 days, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. He reported no dysuria, urinary frequency, obstructive urinary symptoms, antecedent trauma, or vigorous exercise. Examination was notable for a blood pressure of 148/100 mm Hg. The blood level of urea nitrogen was 46 mg per deciliter (16.4 mmol per liter), creatinine 3.5 mg per deciliter (309 \u03bcmol per liter), and potassium 5.7 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test re- sults were essentially unchanged from 10 days earlier. A urinalysis was notable for yellow, cloudy urine, with 3+ blood (normal value, negative), 3+ protein (normal value, nega- tive), 0 to 5 erythrocytes per high-power field (normal range, <5), and 10 to 20 leukocytes per high-power field (normal range, <2). Urine was obtained for culture. The dose of amlodipine was increased. The patient was referred to the outpatient nephrology clinic of this hospital.\nAt this hospital, the patient reported that he had had intermittent hematuria and episodic foamy urine during the previous 10 months. He had new pedal edema that was greater on the right side than on the left side. Since the last visit with his primary care physician approxi- mately 2 weeks earlier, he had had 2 days of coryza but no other respiratory symptoms. There was no anorexia, weight change, pruritus, ab- dominal pain, change in bowel habits, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, cough, hemoptysis, visual or auditory disturbances, headache, neu- rologic symptoms, or other bleeding symptoms. The medical history was notable for rosacea and childhood asthma. Medications included amlo- dipine. There were no known adverse reactions to medications.\nThe patient was in a long-term monogamous\nrelationship. He worked in maintenance but had not been exposed to inhaled chemicals or envi- ronmental allergens. He had not traveled outside Massachusetts. He drank three beers per week and had last smoked marijuana 10 years earlier; he had never used tobacco or other illicit drugs. There was a history of systemic hypertension in his paternal grandfather and a paternal aunt, as well as a history of cancer in multiple maternal relatives, including his mother, who had had brain cancer, and his maternal grandmother and a maternal aunt, who had had breast cancer. There was no known family history of kidney disease.\nThe temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate\n71 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 160/102 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) 27.2. There was 1+ pedal edema. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nResults of liver-function tests, blood levels of creatine kinase and glycated hemoglobin, the in- ternational normalized ratio, and the prothrombin time were normal; other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Tests for hepatitis B surface antigens and surface anti- bodies, hepatitis C antibodies, antinuclear anti- bodies, and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibod- ies were negative. Examination of urine sediment revealed fine granular casts, dysmorphic red cells, and rare white-cell casts.\nDr. Amirkasra Mojtahed: On renal ultrasonogra- phy, the kidneys were normal in size. There was increased bilateral renal parenchymal echo- genicity and no evidence of hydronephrosis (Fig. 1).\nDr. Kalim: Amlodipine was stopped, and labetalol was started.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Andrew L. Lundquist: This 29-year-old man with newly diagnosed hypertension presented with hematuria and was subsequently found to have declining renal function and proteinuria. He had been healthy previously, with no family history of kidney disease. Of note, he had had episodic hematuria and foamy urine without any other systemic symptoms. Other than ped- al edema, the findings on examination were normal.\nThe first step in developing a differential diag- nosis is to determine whether the kidney injury is due to a prerenal condition, intrinsic kidney injury, or an obstructive uropathy. There is no evidence to support a prerenal injury, and the absence of hydronephrosis on renal ultrasonog- raphy rules out obstruction. Instead, the features of this patient\u2019s presentation suggest intrinsic kidney injury.\n\nIntrinsic Kidney Injury\nIntrinsic kidney injury may be due to tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, vascular disease, or glomerular disease. In addition to showing evidence of proteinuria, the urine sediment showed dysmorphic red cells (acanthocytes) and white-cell casts, findings consistent with a ne- phritic syndrome. The presence of acanthocytes is highly specific for glomerular hematuria, and white-cell casts are suggestive of glomerular in- jury and inflammation.1 In the context of hyper- tension, ongoing kidney injury, and new edema, the nephritic urine sediment suggests that the patient has a rapidly progressive glomerulone- phritis.\nThere are numerous types of glomerulone-\nphritis. Several features of this patient\u2019s presen- tation may provide clues to the diagnosis in this case, including his young age, the absence of sys- temic symptoms, and the evidence of a smolder- ing course during the previous 8 to 10 months. Among the types of glomerulonephritis that are commonly seen on examination of a renal bi- opsy specimen,2 which types can cause disease in a 29-year-old patient?\n\nGlomerular Disease in Young Adults\nLupus Nephritis\nLupus nephritis should be considered in a young patient with glomerulonephritis, particularly with a history of rash. Could this patient\u2019s rash, which had been diagnosed as rosacea, be a malar rash? The absence of fatigue, fever, weight loss, and arthralgias and the negative testing for antinu- clear antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies argue strongly against lupus nephri- tis. Rare cases of renal-limited nephritis (also known as \u201clupuslike\u201d nephritis) have been re- ported3 but would be unlikely in this case.\n\nANCA-Associated Vasculitis\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013 associated vasculitis typically occurs in patients older than 50 years of age, with the peak inci- dence occurring from 65 to 75 years of age, but it can occasionally develop in younger patients. Given this patient\u2019s history of childhood asth- ma, we should consider eosinophilic granuloma- tosis with polyangiitis, although patients with this\n \ncondition are typically older and have peripheral eosinophilia and clinically significant respiratory involvement. The absence of malaise, fever, weight loss, and arthralgias makes a diagnosis of systemic vasculitis unlikely. Because cases of renal-limited vasculitis have been described,2 I would perform a test for ANCAs in this patient, but I would expect it to be negative.\n\nAntiglomerular Basement Membrane Disease Antiglomerular basement membrane disease has a divided age distribution, with the peak inci- dence occurring twice, in the third and the sixth decades of life, so the disease would be worth considering in this 29-year-old man with sus- pected rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. In addition to acute kidney injury, pulmonary hemorrhage tends to be present in young pa- tients with this condition, and it was not noted in this patient. It would be appropriate to per- form serologic testing for antiglomerular base- ment membrane disease in this patient, although the features of his presentation would be atypi- cal of this diagnosis.\n\nFibrillary Glomerulonephritis\nFibrillary glomerulonephritis is a rare type of glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis is based on the presence of fibrillar deposits on electron microscopic examination, along with positive staining for a biomarker (DNAJB9) on an immu- nofluorescence study. The majority of patients with this condition are white. However, the mean age at onset is approximately 53 years, and the condition is typically associated with cancer, dysproteinemia, or autoimmune disease4; these features make this diagnosis unlikely in a young and otherwise healthy adult.\n\nGlomerular Disease in the Absence of Systemic Symptoms\nAlport Syndrome\nIn addition to this patient\u2019s young age, the ab- sence of systemic symptoms is a notable finding that suggests he has renal-limited disease. Which causes of glomerular injury are not associated with systemic symptoms?\nThe presence of chronic hematuria and foamy urine along with reduced renal function in a young patient could be consistent with a diagno- sis of the Alport syndrome. This patient had no family history of kidney disease, hematuria, or hearing loss, but approximately 10% of cases of the Alport syndrome are thought to be sponta- neous.5 The absence of sensorineural hearing loss\n\u2014 a finding that is present in approximately 85% of affected males by the time they are 18 years of age6 \u2014 and the acute decline in renal func- tion make a diagnosis of the Alport syndrome unlikely.\n\nPostinfectious Glomerulonephritis\nGlomerular disease due to streptococcal or staphylococcal infection typically occurs 1 to 4 weeks after the initial infection. In this case, there was no description of an initial infection, and the recurrence of hematuria and foamy urine during the previous 8 to 10 months is not consistent with an acute postinfectious glomer- ulonephritis.\n\nProliferative Glomerulonephritis with Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposits\nCirculating paraproteins can result in chronic glomerular injury and in acute rapidly progres- sive glomerulonephritis. Although this patient\u2019s results on serum protein electrophoresis were normal and serum free light chain levels were only modestly elevated, a substantial proportion of patients who have proliferative glomerulone- phritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin de- posits do not have a detectable paraprotein in the serum on presentation. However, the mean age among affected patients is approximately 55 years,7,8 which makes the diagnosis unlikely in this patient.\n\nGlomerular Disease after a Smoldering Course\nC3 Glomerulopathy\nFinally, two types of glomerular disease can cause rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a young patient, in the absence of systemic symp- toms, after a smoldering course over a period of 8 to 10 months. C3 glomerulopathy is a newly defined glomerulonephritis that is characterized by predominant staining for C3 on histopatho- logical examination and manifests as electron- dense deposits or an immune complex\u2013mediated glomerulonephritis. Affected patients may pre- sent at a young age; the mean age at presenta- tion is 32 years in the absence of a paraprotein.9 Patients may have a smoldering course or rap- idly progressive glomerulonephritis. Kidney in-\n \njury is caused by dysregulation (overactivity) of the alternative complement pathway that is due to acquired or inherited factors. Efforts to treat C3 glomerulopathy have had mixed results, with end-stage renal disease developing after 10 years in up to 70% of patients.10,11 This is a rare diag- nosis (1 to 2 cases per 1 million population), but it is worth keeping in the differential diagnosis in this case.\n\nIgA Nephropathy\nIgA nephropathy is a common form of glo- merular disease in young adults and the most common glomerular disease in the developed world. This patient\u2019s presentation is highly sug- gestive of IgA nephropathy \u2014 a glomerulone- phritis that typically occurs without systemic symptoms, has a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life, and has male pre- dominance in white populations, occurring twice as often in men as in women.12,13 IgA nephropathy is diagnosed in approximately 25% of persons in Europe who undergo renal biopsy and in up to 40% of persons in Asia14; these data are consistent with genomewide as- sociation studies that have identified predis- posing alleles in certain populations.15 Loci of genetic risk show the importance of the muco- sal epithelial barrier and the immune response. In persons who have a predisposition to IgA nephropathy, mucosal infections result in the secretion of immunogenic and poorly galacto- sylated polymeric IgA1, which leads to immune complex deposition in the renal mesangium and thereby activates complement, with subse- quent renal injury.16 The majority of patients with IgA nephropathy present with asymptom- atic chronic hematuria and proteinuria or with gross hematuria in the context of an upper re- spiratory or gastrointestinal infection. Less than 10% of patients have a presentation simi- lar to that seen in this patient, with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis suggestive of proliferative or crescentic disease. Renal biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis of IgA nephropa- thy; serologic tests, including tests for comple- ment and serum IgA levels, are nondiagnostic, and currently, no biomarkers have been identi- fied for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy.\nIn summary, the most likely diagnosis in this young, previously healthy patient is IgA ne- phropathy associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and crescentic disease. Al- though it is rare, C3 glomerulopathy is worth considering since it can mimic IgA nephropathy. Renal biopsy, which is required for the diagnosis of both IgA nephropathy and C3 glomerulopa- thy, is the next diagnostic test I would pursue in this case.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Kristen J. Tomaszewski: The differential diagno- sis for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in an otherwise healthy 29-year-old man without extrarenal symptoms can be divided into three categories: antiglomerular basement membrane disease, pauci-immune disease (i.e., ANCA-associated disease), or select immune complex\u2013mediated or complement-related causes (e.g., IgA nephropathy or C3 glomerulopathy). In this case,Western blot analysis for the detection of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies and an indirect immunofluorescence assay for the detection of ANCAs were negative.\nRenal biopsy was performed (Fig. 2), and ex- amination of the biopsy specimen revealed a crescentic glomerulonephritis with cellular and fibrocellular crescents. More than half the glom- eruli had mesangial hypercellularity. Mononu- clear endocapillary hypercellularity and segmen- tal sclerosis were noted. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy involved approximately 30% of the renal cortex.\nImmunofluorescence studies showed intense (4+) staining of granular mesangial IgA deposits in the glomeruli. There was less intense staining of additional immunoreactants, including C3 (with focal 3+ staining), a finding inconsistent with a diagnosis of C3 glomerulopathy. The overall staining pattern of predominant IgA deposits in the renal mesangium is diagnostic of an IgA- related glomerulonephritis. Given the finding of a crescentic glomerulonephritis on light micro- scopic examination, a diagnosis of crescentic IgA nephropathy was rendered.\nThe pathophysiology of IgA nephropathy may be linked to aberrant mucosal immune activity, formation of abnormal IgA, autoantibody produc- tion, or genetic factors. Of note, discrete micro- scopic findings in IgA nephropathy confer prog- nostic information. The Oxford Classification of IgA Nephropathy describes five histologic vari- ables that are associated with clinical outcome: mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hypercellularity (E), segmental glomerulosclero- sis (S), tubular atrophy or interstitial fibrosis (T), and cellular or fibrocellular crescents (C). These variables form the elements of the MEST-C scor- ing system (Table 3). Higher scores (M1, S1, T1, T2, and C2) are associated with a swifter decline in renal function or progression to end-stage renal disease; scores of E1 and C1 are associated with a swifter decline specifically in patients who are not receiving immunosuppressive ther- apy.18,19 In this case, the patient\u2019s MEST-C score (Table 3) suggests a high risk of renal failure.\n\n",
