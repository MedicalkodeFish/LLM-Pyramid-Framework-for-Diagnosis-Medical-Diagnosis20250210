    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the intensive care unit of this hospital for persistent postoperative cardiogenic shock and new diffuse rash after undergoing mitral-valve replacement.\nTwo months before this evaluation, the patient was admitted to another hospi- tal with anorexia, generalized weakness, fatigue, and edema. Examination of the lungs was notable for decreased breath sounds and basilar crackles. The level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide was 15,895 pg per milliliter (reference value, <1500).\nDr. Matthew T. Stib: A chest radiograph (Fig. 1A) showed a mildly enlarged car-\ndiac silhouette, as well as evidence of pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural ef- fusions.\nDr. Dudzinski: At the other hospital, intravenous furosemide was administered.\nBlood cultures obtained at the time of admission grew methicillin-sensitive Staph- ylococcus aureus (MSSA) in four of four bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) reportedly revealed moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation and a 7-mm vegetation on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. Treatment with intravenous oxacillin was initiated; a 4-week course of treatment was planned, after which the patient was scheduled for follow-up in the cardiac surgery clinic at this hospital.\nHowever, 3 weeks after discharge, the patient reported dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, progressive edema of the legs, and weight gain of 7 kg. He was admitted  to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nMedical history was notable for hypertension, right bundle-branch block, hypo- thyroidism, and prostatism, as well as atrial fibrillation, for which the patient had undergone cardioversion. Surgical history included tooth extraction for a painful dental abscess 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital, appendectomy,arthroplasty of the left hip after a fall 3 years earlier, and repair of a meniscus tear in the left knee. Medications included oxacillin adminis- tered intravenously every 4 hours and oral furo- semide, sotalol, rivaroxaban, levothyroxine, and tamsulosin. He had had no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient was retired and lived with his spouse. He reported that, before his admission to the other hospital, he had been riding a bi- cycle a few miles several times per week. He had previously smoked cigarettes but had quit 30 years earlier; he consumed one beer weekly and used no other substances. His family history was notable for atrial fibrillation.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 83 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/72 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He ap- peared fatigued. The jugular venous pressure was elevated, at 15 cm of water. The cardiac impulse was discrete and was not displaced. Auscultation of the chest revealed an irregularly irregular cardiac rhythm, with a grade 3/6 holo- systolic murmur at the left sternal border and apex that did not change with respiration, and bibasilar crackles. There was 2+ pitting edema in the legs. A peripherally inserted central catheter was present in the right arm.\nThe blood levels of calcium, magnesium, albu- min, lipase, glycated hemoglobin, alkaline phos- phatase, and bilirubin were normal, and a screen- ing test for human immunodeficiency virus antigen and antibodies was negative. Other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood were obtained. An electrocardiogram (Fig. 1B) showed atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular premature beats, and right bundle- branch block.\nDr. Stib: A chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) showed bilateral pulmonary edema, which was more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung, as well as pleural effusions and left atrial en- largement. The tip of a peripherally inserted central catheter was appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava.\nDr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous oxacillin and furosemide was continued. TEE (Fig. 1D) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) re- vealed a normal-sized left ventricle with an ejec- tion fraction of 61%,  dilatation of the right ventricle with normal function, dilatation of both atria, mitral-valve perforation and thickening, severe mitral regurgitation due to mitral-valve perforation, and moderate tricuspid regurgita- tion with a right ventricular systolic pressure of 48 mm Hg (also see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Coronary angiography revealed 70% stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and 90% stenosis in the middle right coronary artery.\nOn hospital day 11, cardiac surgery was per- formed. The patient underwent bioprosthetic mitral-valve replacement, along with two-vessel coronary-artery bypass grafting and amputa- tion of the left atrial appendage. TEE per- formed after the surgical procedure revealed a well-seated mitral prosthesis with trace central regurgitation, as well as mild biventricular sys- tolic dysfunction. Subsequently, on transfer to the intensive care unit, the blood pressure was 108/52 mm Hg and the cardiac index 3.0 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area while the patient was receiving epineph- rine (at a rate of 2 \u03bcg per minute), norepineph- rine (10  \u03bcg per minute), and vasopressin (0.04  U per minute). An electrocardiogram (Fig. 1E) showed atrial fibrillation, right bundle-branch block, and ventricular premature beats. During postoperative day 1, the patient had increased ventricular ectopy and a 25-beat run of ven- tricular tachycardia. Laboratory and hemody- namic data are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Stib: An anteroposterior chest radiograph (Fig. 1F) showed left atrial enlargement, bilat- eral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with sternotomy wires, an endotracheal tube, a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, bilateral chest tubes, and a mediastinal drain.\nDr. Dudzinski: Treatment with intravenous amiodarone was started, and the epinephrine infu- sion was discontinued.\nOn postoperative day 2, the trachea was extu- bated, and mechanical ventilation was discon- tinued. The cardiac index had decreased to less than 2.0 liters per minute per square meter, and intravenous milrinone was initiated. The next day, a 35-beat run of ventricular tachycardia oc- curred. On postoperative day 4, given that the cardiac index was less than 1.9 liters per minute per square meter, intravenous dopamine was started. On postoperative day 5, deep-vein thrombosis was identified in the right lower leg,and treatment with warfarin was started. A truncal macular rash was noted. TTE revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32%,right ventricular dysfunction, atrial dilatation, trace central prosthetic mitral regurgitation with a mean transmitral gradient of 5 mm Hg measured at 70 beats per minute, and moder- ate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (see Video 3). There was also worsening renal function. Milrinone was stopped and epinephrine ini- tiated.\nOn postoperative day 8, microbiologic cul- tures obtained during the surgical procedure showed no growth; the patient\u2019s oxacillin treat- ment was switched to cefazolin. During the next few days, the rash became more confluent and extended to the face, back, arms, and neck in addition to the trunk, but there was no mu- cosal involvement. Examination of the joints was normal, and there was no lymphadenopa- thy or hepatosplenomegaly. The arms and legs were cool, and urine output had decreased, despite continued therapy with intravenous epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Lab- oratory test results are shown in Table 1. Re- peat TTE on postoperative day 13 revealed borderline left ventricular dilatation with an ejection fraction of 37%, right ventricular dila- tation and dysfunction, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page). Cardiac and Radiographic Studies. An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at the other hospital (Panel A) shows a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette and mild pulmonary edema. An electrocardio-\ngram obtained on admission to this hospital (Panel B) shows atrial fibrillation, multifocal ventricular prema- ture beats, and right bundle-branch block. An antero- posterior chest radiograph obtained at this hospital (Panel C) shows mild cardiomegaly that is unchanged from that observed on the image obtained at the other hospital, with increased pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. The tip of a peripherally inserted cen- tral catheter is appropriately positioned in the lower superior vena cava. An image from three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (Panel D) shows severe mitral regurgitation (orange-red jet and asterisk) due to a perforation at the lateral mitral-valve annulus. This image shows the \u201csurgeon\u2019s view,\u201d with the aortic valve (AV) anterior to the mitral valve (white oval) and the lateral aspect of the mitral valve on the left side of the image. Subsequently, cardiac surgery was performed. An electrocardiogram obtained postoperatively (Panel E) shows atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, and right bundle-branch block. An anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained postoperatively while the patient was in the supine position (Panel F) shows left atrial enlargement, bilateral pulmonary edema, and basilar atelectasis, along with support catheters and tubes (endotracheal and orogastric tubes, bilateral chest tubes, a mediastinal drain, the tip of a catheter in the right main pulmonary artery, and a peripherally inserted central catheter) and median sternotomy wires. Bilateral costophrenic angles were not included in the field of view. No evidence of pneumothorax was observed.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Akshay S. Desai: This 76-year-old man pre- sented with new-onset heart failure in the con- text of S. aureus bacteremia that was possibly as- sociated with a dental abscess that had been identified 6 weeks before admission to the other hospital. Initial evaluation of the patient at the other hospital revealed mitral-valve endocarditis with a vegetation on the anterior mitral-valve leaflet. He had been discharged home with in- structions to complete an extended antibiotic course of intravenous oxacillin, but worsening heart failure developed within 3 weeks after discharge. Notably, at the time of admission to this hospital, no rash was reported on examina- tion, and the laboratory evaluation was largely unremarkable except for a mildly elevated serum creatinine level that decreased with  treatment for the patient\u2019s heart failure. Echocardiography confirmed the presence of intact left ventricular function with perforation of the mitral-valve leaflet and severe mitral regurgitation. The pa- tient was referred for surgical mitral-valve re- placement, coronary-artery bypass grafting, and amputation of the left atrial appendage.\n\nShock after Cardiotomy\nThe patient\u2019s early postoperative course was complicated by shock, for which he received high-dose vasoactive support for stabilization. Possible causes of postcardiotomy shock include primary cardiac abnormalities such as ventricu- lar failure or myocardial stunning, myocardial infarction, or acute valvular obstruction or re- gurgitation; extrinsic obstruction from pericar- dial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, or ten- sion pneumothorax; hypovolemia from bleeding or inadequate volume resuscitation; neurogenic causes such as spinal cord injury; and distribu- tive causes including vasoplegia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, anaphylaxis, infec- tion, and adrenal insufficiency.\nThis patient was neurologically intact with no overt bleeding or hypoxemia. Postoperative echo- cardiography revealed biventricular dysfunction that was moderate on the left side and mild on the right side with no pericardial effusion, chest radiography showed no evidence of pneumotho- rax, and electrocardiography revealed no evidence of ischemia. Given the patient\u2019s negative blood cultures, normal intracardiac filling pressures, low cardiac index, and low systemic vascular resistance, the most likely cause of his early postoperative shock was mixed cardiogenic in- sufficiency with vasodilatory shock from a sys- temic inflammatory response.\n\nMyocarditis\nDespite initial stabilization and successful extu- bation, the patient subsequently had recurrent hemodynamic deterioration on postoperative days 3 and 4, with nonsustained ventricular tachycar- dia, worsening renal function, progressive left ventricular dysfunction identified on echocar- diography, and a worsening cardiac index that resulted in intensification of inotropic support. This biphasic pattern of worsening cardiogenic shock after cardiac surgery is distinctly unusual in the absence of additional cardiac insult. Pos- sible factors that could explain this patient\u2019s deterioration include myocardial infarction re- sulting from abrupt graft loss, sudden dehis- cence of the mitral-valve prosthesis, late tam- ponade resulting from pericardial bleeding, acute pulmonary embolism, progressive aortic dissection, and fulminant myocarditis. Fulmi- nant myocarditis is a concern, given the absence of valvular dysfunction or paravalvular leak, worsening pericardial effusion, electrocardio- graphic changes, chest pain, and hypoxemia.\nAlthough fulminant viral (lymphocytic) myo-\ncarditis and giant-cell myocarditis should be briefly considered in this case, the concomitant development of a rash and worsening eosino- philia make eosinophilic myocarditis a more like- ly diagnosis. Possible causes of eosinophilic myocarditis include hypersensitivity myocarditis or acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and myocarditis related to idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (L\u00f6ffler\u2019s endocar- ditis), parasitic infection (e.g., Toxocara canis), or\n \ncancer (e.g., myeloproliferative disorder). In this patient, the rapid onset of ventricular dysfunction after cardiac surgery in conjunction with the development of new rash and eosinophilia, as well as the absence of viral or parasitic infection and of typical features of EGPA, heighten suspi- cion for hypersensitivity myocarditis that is most likely related to one of the many drugs adminis- tered during his hospital stay. This form of myo- carditis is among the most common forms of eosinophilic myocarditis and is associated with  a particularly high risk of in-hospital death.1\n\nDrug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms\nIn patients with hypersensitivity myocarditis, the clinical syndrome of rapid hemodynamic deterio- ration in association with worsening cardiac and renal function, rash, and eosinophilia arouses concern about possible acute necrotizing eosino- philic myocarditis (a more severe variation of hy- persensitivity myocarditis associated with exten- sive myocyte damage and necrosis) or the syndrome of DRESS (drug reaction with eosino- philia and systemic symptoms). DRESS is typi- cally characterized by a constellation of findings, including fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, rash or erythroderma, abnormal liver-function tests, atypical lymphocytes, and multiorgan in- volvement; however, the presentation is highly variable, and not all features are present in every patient.2 In this case, although the rash, progres- sive eosinophilia, heart failure, and kidney injury were typical of DRESS, fever and lymphadenopa- thy were notably absent, and only a single mea- surement of the aspartate aminotransferase level on postoperative day 1 was abnormal. Medica- tions that are common triggers of DRESS include antibiotic agents, anticonvulsant agents, and an- tituberculous therapies, among others.3 Typically, systemic symptoms appear 2 to 8 weeks after exposure to the triggering agent; a review of this patient\u2019s medication history suggests that oxacil- lin was the most likely culprit in this case. Nota- bly, the eosinophil count was already rising on laboratory testing immediately before surgery, a finding that suggests that drugs given later in the hospital course were less likely to be the cause of DRESS. To  establish  the  diagnosis  of  DRESS, I would recommend an endomyocardial biopsy; a skin biopsy of the rash might also provide addi- tional supportive evidence.",
