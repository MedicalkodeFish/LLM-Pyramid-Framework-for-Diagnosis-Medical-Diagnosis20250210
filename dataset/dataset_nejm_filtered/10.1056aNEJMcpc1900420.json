    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Madeline L. Keyes (Pediatrics): A 32-day-old male infant was transferred to the emergency department and admitted to this hospital for evaluation of suspected abusive head trauma.\nOn the evening of admission, the patient\u2019s mother called emergency medical services and reported that the patient had fallen. The mother reported that the infant had been well until that evening, when she placed him on her bed before briefly stepping a short distance away to warm up a bottle of formula in the micro- wave. She heard a thud and then returned to find that the baby had fallen less than 1 m (2 to 3 ft) from the bed to the hardwood floor, where he was lying face down and crying. She picked him up immediately to console him. After continuing to cry for several minutes, the patient suddenly became quiet; this behavior was worrisome to the mother and prompted her to call for emergency medical as- sistance. During the phone call, the baby resumed crying. On arrival of emer- gency medical services personnel several minutes later, the infant appeared well and was bottle-feeding without difficulty; there were no signs of injury. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the baby had not lost\nconsciousness or vomited during the event and was behaving normally. On examina- tion, the patient was alert, regarded the examiner, cried when he was undressed, and calmed when he was swaddled. The vital signs were normal. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic. There were no bruises or subconjunctival hemor- rhages, and results of abdominal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic examinations were normal, as was the remainder of the physical examination.\nDr. Paul A. Caruso: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of contrast material, revealed scattered punctate densities in the right and left superior occipital lobes, a density (3 mm in diameter) extending along the left tentorial leaflet, mild prominence of both opercula, and mild diffuse prominence of the extraaxial spaces (Fig. 1).\nDr. Keyes: A report of suspected abusive head trauma was filed with the Massachusetts Depart- ment of Children and Families, and the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, a history was ob- tained from the patient\u2019s mother. The patient was born at another hospital after 37 weeks of gesta- tion; labor was induced because of maternal pre- eclampsia, and the infant was delivered vaginally. At delivery, a nuchal cord was unwrapped from the baby\u2019s neck. He received routine newborn care and was feeding and growing well. Two weeks before the current evaluation, he was seen in the emergency department of the first hospi- tal because of three episodes of vomiting; ab- dominal ultrasonography performed during that visit did not reveal findings consistent with pyloric stenosis. During the 10 to 14 days before the current evaluation, the patient was fussy. He had a diaper rash, for which his pediatrician pre- scribed topical nystatin; in addition, his mother was applying a zinc oxide\u2013containing cream to the rash. He took no other medications and had no known allergies. His mother had a history of asthma, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anx- iety; she had placed frequent calls to emergency medical services because of concerns about her health but was often reassured by the respond- ing personnel and not transported to a hospital. Both of the patient\u2019s maternal grandparents had a history of substance use disorder, and his mater- nal grandmother had died of a heroin overdose. The patient lived with his mother in housing funded by the Department of Mental Health. They were visited each week by a case manager and received social support from an aunt. The patient\u2019s mother was a high school graduate and was certified as an emergency medical techni- cian; she had been in the custody of the Depart- ment of Children and Families during adoles- cence and had a 2-year-old daughter who had been placed with the aunt at the recommendation of the Department of Children and Families because of concerns about the mother\u2019s mental health issues. Although the case involving the daughter was closed, the mother reported that she still had contact with her former social worker, who continued to provide support. The pregnancy with the patient was unplanned and occurred near the beginning of the mother\u2019s relationship with the father of the baby; this relationship was characterized by young age and intimate-partner violence, and the couple sepa- rated before the birth of the infant. The mother  was the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, although on two occasions (the most recent one occurring 6 days before this evaluation), the baby had spent time with his father.\n\nOn examination, the patient was alert and vigorous and appeared well. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 161 beats per minute, the blood  pressure  86/50  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory rate 56 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 3.99 kg (18th percentile), the length 53 cm (17th percentile), and the head circumference 35 cm (2nd percentile). There were no exterior signs of facial or scalp trauma, and the anterior fontanelle was soft and flat. An intraoral examination did not reveal lesions; the lingual frenulum was intact. The abdomen was soft, without distention, tenderness, or masses. Examination of the skin revealed scattered skin- colored papules (1 mm in diameter) on the chest and face, a crescent-shaped erythematous patch above the right nipple, a blanching erythematous macule (3 mm in diameter) on the left buttock, erythema of the intergluteal cleft, and a scratch (3 mm by 2 mm) behind the left knee. The re- mainder of the physical examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the hospital, and addi- tional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Caruso: Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), performed 16 hours after the head CT, revealed a lobular focus of hemorrhage (15 mm by 2 mm) in the right su- perior occipital gyrus that was probably chronic and corresponded to the 2-mm punctate density seen on non\u2013contrast-enhanced CT. A similar focus of hemorrhage in the left superior occipital gyrus was also probably chronic. A focus of hem- orrhage in the right caudothalamic groove and two foci of hemorrhage or mineralization (3 mm in diameter) in the bilateral choroid plexuses were also seen (Fig. 2).\n\n \nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Alice W. Newton: I am aware of the diagnosis in this case and participated in the care of this patient. This 1-month-old infant reportedly had a short fall at home. Although he appeared to be neurologically normal, a CT scan of the head showed multiple areas of intraparenchymal bleeding as well as enlarged extraaxial spaces, findings suggestive of subdural hemorrhage. In this case, it is critical to rule out possible abusive head injury. On the basis of this concern, I will construct a differential diagnosis to consider nonaccidental head injury as well as other medi- cal conditions that may result in subdural bleed- ing that mimics trauma due to child abuse.\n\nAccidental Trauma\nThis infant reportedly had a short fall with no signs of bruising or head injury and no loss of consciousness. The vast majority of household falls in infants result in no injury, and in most cases, parents do not seek medical attention.1 In this case, the mother reported that she did not see the fall but was nearby when it happened, and she said that the infant cried immediately and was able to be consoled. This minor house- hold fall would not explain intracranial hemor- rhage (possibly of a chronic nature) in multiple areas of the brain.\n\nArteriovenous Malformation\nThe presence of intracranial hemorrhage leads to the consideration of possible ruptured vascu- lar malformation. The most common vascular malformation in infants, albeit rare, is a vein of Galen abnormality,2 which may be diagnosed on the basis of magnetic resonance angiographic findings such as dilated venous structures in the posterior fossa that are likely to displace cerebel- lar tissue. Other forms of arteriovenous malforma- tion \u2014 such as those seen in PHACE syndrome, defined by posterior fossa anomalies, hemangio- mas, arterial and cardiac anomalies, and eye and endocrine abnormalities \u2014 are exceedingly rare. This patient\u2019s clinical presentation and neuroim- aging findings are not consistent with rupture or leaking of a vascular malformation.\nMetabolic Disease\nMetabolic disease is a consideration, with glu- taric acidemia type I being the metabolic disor- der most commonly associated with unexplained subdural hemorrhage in infants. This condition rarely leads to clinical signs in infancy and often comes to medical attention with an episode of metabolic decompensation associated with illness. In untreated infants, microencephalic macro- cephaly may develop over time, possibly leading to movement disorder and intellectual disability.\nBecause there are a few published cases of glu- taric acidemia type I that resulted in bleeding in the subdural space, this rare metabolic condi- tion is classically considered as a possible alter- native diagnosis to abusive head trauma.3 How- ever, studies show that subdural hemorrhage in glutaric acidemia type I is exceedingly uncom- mon and is associated with other brain abnor- malities, including cerebral atrophy.4 This infant did not have any of the head imaging findings that would commonly suggest glutaric acidemia type I, and routine newborn screening for this disorder had been negative.\n\nBenign Hemorrhage\nMany infants have prominent subarachnoid spaces on imaging. Some have benign enlarge- ment of the subarachnoid space (BESS), a clini- cal syndrome that leads to mild macrocephaly.5 These infants usually receive this diagnosis when their head circumference increases dispropor- tionately to the rest of their growth measure- ments; the increased head circumference is noted at approximately 3 to 4 months of age, with the accelerated growth slowing during the second year of life. In rare cases of BESS in in- fants, imaging reveals an incidental small col- lection of localized asymptomatic subdural hem- orrhage that is thought to result from minor trauma with associated rupture of bridging veins, which have been stretched owing to the presence of excessive subarachnoid fluid collec- tion. Because this phenomenon is rare and in- flicted injury is much more common, the pres- ence of unexplained subdural hemorrhage in an infant, even one with BESS, leads to an evalua- tion for signs of possible child abuse.\nCerebral Sinus Venous Thrombosis\nAlthough cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.67 in 100,000 children per year, the development of this condition can result in severe neurologic complications and death in infants.6,7 Initial cranial imaging may show signs of intracranial hemorrhage with hemorrhagic infarction of brain tissue. It is important to note that cerebral si- nus venous thrombosis does not occur without an inciting event, such as dehydration, infec- tion, a prothrombotic disorder, or an underly- ing chronic disease, such as cancer or sickle- cell disease. In addition, infants with this condition usually appear ill, often presenting with seizure, focal neurologic signs, vomiting and lethargy, or a decreased level of conscious- ness, findings not consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nBirth Trauma\nAsymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in the subdural, intraventricular, and parenchymal re- gions has been documented in full-term infants after birth. The most common type is subdural hemorrhage, which has been detected in 26 to 50% of full-term infants.8,9 Subdural hemor- rhage is most often found in the posterior supra- tentorial region, although it may also be seen in the posterior fossa. It is usually related to the application of direct forces on the head \u2014 either compression during vaginal birth with associated stretching of the tentorium as the head is dis- torted, or external forces related to vacuum or forceps delivery. In addition, a small but signifi- cant number of infants delivered by uncompli- cated cesarean section are found to have asymp- tomatic subdural hemorrhage. Most cases of subdural hemorrhage resolve within 1 month, with all cases resolving in less than 3 months.9 A significant number of infants have hemor- rhage not only in the subdural region but also in other compartments of the brain, including pa- renchymal, periventricular, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.10 This patient\u2019s clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of intracranial bleeding related to birth trauma, provided that we can rule out abusive head trauma in this case.\nAbusive Head Trauma\nIn cases of suspected child abuse, a complete and detailed medical history should be taken, with attention paid to adherence to proper well- child care, nutritional status, medications and vitamins, previous episodes of trauma or unex- plained bruising or bleeding, and unexplained neurologic symptoms that may represent past episodes of abuse, including a history of apnea, altered mental status, or unexplained vomiting. Symptoms of abusive head trauma occur on a spectrum, with mild injury leading to minimal symptoms that may be mistaken for viral illness or normal newborn irritability. Among patients with a diagnosis of abusive head trauma, the in-\n \ncidence of unrecognized past episodes of abuse has been estimated to be 25 to 30%.11,12\nThis infant had a household fall without any neurologic consequences, and the physical exam- ination was reassuring. However, two features of this case \u2014 the scratch behind his knee and the history of unexplained vomiting that was severe enough for the child to undergo testing to rule out pyloric stenosis \u2014 are worrisome. The inter- pretation of imaging findings from the other hospital also raised concerns, with possible intra- parenchymal and \u201cchronic\u201d subdural hemorrhage noted.\nOn the one hand, there are several social risk factors for child abuse in this case, including the parents\u2019 history of intimate-partner violence, young age, and poverty status, as well as the mother\u2019s history of mental illness. On the other hand, there are clear family strengths and sup- ports: the mother had ongoing housing assis- tance and mental health treatment from the Department of Mental Health, as well as active help from her aunt, who was raising her other child. Initial evaluation of the infant for abusive head trauma was driven by the social risk fac- tors, since the child did not have clinical signs or symptoms that would prompt imaging evalu- ation for head injury. Although some findings on the head CT were interpreted correctly, the initial interpretation of the CT findings as pos- sibly chronic subdural hemorrhage increased the level of concern about abusive injury.\nMRI evaluation of the infant provided impor-\ntant information in that the pattern of hemor- rhage and normal brain findings in the context of the healthy clinical status of the infant did not fit classic findings of abusive head trauma. Subdural hemorrhage along the tentorium is a finding commonly associated with birth trauma. Intraventricular hemorrhage in small amounts has also been described with birth trauma, as has the presence of subpial hemorrhage. Although it is possible for birth-related hemorrhage to occur in multiple compartments, such extensive areas of hemorrhage should prompt a hematologic evaluation for possible bleeding disorders, since signs and symptoms of bleeding dyscrasia may mimic child abuse.13 Making the determination of whether a child has been abused is often not clear-cut. Given the ramifications to the child and the family, the determination must be based not only on descriptions in the medical literature but also on review of all the features of the case in combination with experienced clinical judg- ment. In this case, evaluation for other signs of physical abuse was reassuring, with normal re- sults of a retinal examination, initial laboratory testing, and a skeletal survey. Taken together, these features suggest that the most likely diag- nosis in this case is hemorrhage due to birth trauma rather than abusive head trauma.\nDr. Virginia M. Pierce (Pathology): Dr. Ebb, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this infant?\nDr. David H. Ebb: In cases of suspected child abuse, the process begins with an effort to elicit any history of abnormal bleeding or bruising in the child or family as well as a thorough physical examination to look for evidence of acute or subacute bleeding or bruising. Diagnostic stud- ies include imaging of the head, trunk, arms, and legs to identify bleeding that may not be imme- diately apparent on examination.14 Imaging eval- uation must be undertaken in concert with blood tests to look for evidence of an inherited or acquired bleeding disorder, which may guide emergency therapeutic interventions.15 In cases in which a rare bleeding disorder is discovered, it is the hematologist\u2019s role to assist the multi- disciplinary team in ensuring that the child is not inappropriately removed from the family when no clear history of abuse is elicited and a robust network of social supports can be documented.\nIn reviewing the history of the child and the family, it is important to learn whether there is a history of mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., bruis- ing, epistaxis, or menorrhagia), which could suggest a quantitative or functional platelet defect. A history of joint bleeding or deep-muscle hematoma is most frequently elicited in the context of a clotting-factor deficiency. Although the complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen level can be used to identify most inherited or acquired coagulation defects that cause bleeding complications in infants or older children, these measurements cannot be used to identify defi- ciencies in factor XIII, which may be associated with delayed separation of the umbilical cord stump. Of note, easy bruising or mucocutaneous bleeding may be caused by von Willebrand\u2019s dis- ease, the most common inherited bleeding disorder. This disease causes impaired platelet binding to injured vessel walls, and a specif- ic panel of tests is needed to confirm or rule out its contribution to unexpected bruising or bleeding.\nOn further review, this patient\u2019s family his- tory was notable for easy bruising and epistaxis in maternal relatives of both sexes, a feature that suggests the possibility of von Willebrand\u2019s dis- ease. Laboratory studies revealed a normal plate- let count and fibrinogen level and normal results of screening tests for clotting-factor deficiencies (i.e., measurements of prothrombin time and partial-thromboplastin time). A subsequent pan- el of tests for von Willebrand\u2019s disease revealed a relatively low factor VIII level and normal lev- els of ristocetin cofactor activity and von Wille- brand factor antigen. This patient\u2019s constellation of family history and laboratory findings was thought to be most consistent with either mild factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) or von Wille- brand\u2019s disease type 2N, which is a rare variant; further laboratory investigation was needed. Al- though von Willebrand\u2019s disease is relatively common in its mildest form, it rarely causes intracranial hemorrhage.13,15 The possibility that this child\u2019s bleeding occurred in the absence of any identifiable predisposing factors was also strongly considered.\n\n\n\n",
