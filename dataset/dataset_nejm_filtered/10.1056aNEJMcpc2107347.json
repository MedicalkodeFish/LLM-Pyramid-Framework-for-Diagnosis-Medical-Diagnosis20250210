    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 47-year-old right-handed man was evaluated at this hospi- tal because of pain on the left side of the head and neck.\nSix years before the current evaluation, the patient was admitted to this hospi- tal with 1 week of headache, pain on the left side of the neck, numbness on the left side of the face, and dizziness. The pain was not relieved with the use of ibuprofen and had previously been evaluated and treated by a chiropractor. A neu- rologic examination revealed a slight decrease in taste and in sensation to touch and temperature on the left side of the face; a gait evaluation revealed a subtle leftward sway. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Byung C. Yoon: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed subtle foci of hypoden- sity in the left cerebellum, a finding suggestive of infarction. There was no evi- dence of arterial dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, or thrombotic occlusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, confirmed the presence of a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct (Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C). Dr. Dudzinski: The patient had normal results on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, echocardiography, and a hypercoagulability panel, except for a mildly elevated level of anticardiolipin IgM (18.9 IgM phospholipid units; reference range, 0 to 15). During the hospital admission, lesions with a vesicular appearance developed on the left side of the lips and oral cavity, and the patient was treated with famciclo- vir. He was discharged home while receiving aspirin, with a follow-up visit sched-\nuled in the neurology clinic.\nOne month later in the neurology clinic, the patient reported partial resolution of headache, persistent neck pain and ear pain with balance difficulty, and perioral paresthesia. There was diminished sensation on the left side of the face (similar to that observed during the previous examination). No oropharyngeal lesions were visible. An evaluation of gait and balance was normal.\nDr. Yoon: Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, performed before and after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed expected evolu- tion of the left cerebellar infarct and no new infarction. The left posterior inferior cerebellar artery was not visualized, possibly because of occlusion or slow blood flow.\nDr. Dudzinski: Repeat CSF analysis showed normal protein and glucose levels and 14 white cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), of which 94% were lymphocytes. Gram\u2019s staining showed no organisms. CSF tests for borrelia and varicella DNA and for cytomegalovirus and her- pes simplex virus antibodies were negative. Two days later, cerebral angiography revealed mild narrowing of the origin of the left vertebral ar- tery. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, antineutro- phil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies were negative, as was a rapid plasma reagin test.\nThe patient received follow-up care at another\nhospital until the current evaluation, when he presented to the emergency department of this hospital with 3 days of severe pain on exertion that affected the left side of the neck and left temporo-occipital region. The symptoms were similar to those he had reported in the past and were not relieved with the use of ibuprofen or marijuana. The head pain was described as pulsat- ing and pounding, and it worsened when he was in the supine position.\nThe patient reported right flank pain; the onset of this pain had occurred with lifting of a heavy object and had just preceded the onset of headache. He also reported a tendency to bruise. The review of systems was otherwise normal. His medical history was notable for dyslipidemia. He had undergone repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of a traumatic dislocation of the right shoulder. Medications included rosu- vastatin and gemfibrozil, as well as acetamino- phen as needed. There were no known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was a self- employed laborer and lived with his wife and children in a suburb of Boston. He smoked cigars and marijuana occasionally, and he drank up to eight beers per day on weekends. His family his- tory was notable for hypertension and dyslipid- emia in both of his parents, as well as early- onset dementia in his father.\nThe temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 176/119 mm Hg in both arms, the heart rate 72 beats per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 98% while the patient was breathing ambi- ent air. A neurologic examination revealed a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but was otherwise normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, troponin T, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein(a), and glycated hemoglobin were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial-thromboplastin time, and results of renal function tests. Urinalysis was also normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Yoon: CT angiography of the head and\nneck, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the left vertebral artery, extending from the origin of the artery to the proximal V3 (upper cer- vical) segment, with a 2-mm pseudoaneurysm at the C2\u2013C3 level (Fig. 1D and 1E). There was no evidence of acute ischemia. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of infarction or a perfusion abnor- mality. However, a T1-weighted image showed a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, a finding consistent with hem- orrhage within the vessel wall from the dissec- tion (Fig. 1F).\nDr. Dudzinski: The patient was admitted to the neurology service. Control of the blood pressure required multiple medications. Echocardiography showed no cardiac, valvular, or aortic structural abnormality. Right flank pain recurred. Urinaly- sis showed 5 to 10 red cells per high-power field but was otherwise normal.\nDr. Yoon: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the ar- tery to subsegmental renal arteries. Perinephric fat stranding was present on the right side, and there were areas of diminished enhancement in the right kidney. These findings were suggestive of infarction (Fig. 2).\n\nFigure 1. MRI and CT Angiogram.\nSix years before the current evaluation, MRI of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous con\u2011 trast material. A diffusion\u2011weighted image (Panel A) shows subtle foci of hyperintensity in the left medial cerebel\u2011 lum (arrow) and left lateral medulla (arrowhead). On an apparent diffusion coefficient map (Panel B), the corre\u2011 sponding lesions are isointense to hyperintense. On a T2\u2011weighted fluid\u2011attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel C), the lesions are hyperintense (arrow and arrowhead). These findings are consistent with evolving nonacute in\u2011 farcts. On the current evaluation, CT angiography of the neck was performed after the administration of contrast material. An axial image (Panel D) shows asymmetric irregularity of the left vertebral artery at the C2\u2013C3 level (ar\u2011 row), a finding consistent with dissection. A maximum\u2011intensity\u2011projection reformation (Panel E) shows a medially directed 2\u2011mm pseudoaneurysm (arrow) along the dissected left vertebral artery (LVA). In addition, MRI was per\u2011 formed before the administration of contrast material. A T1\u2011weighted image obtained at the C2\u2013C3 level (Panel F) shows a curvilinear mural hematoma with intrinsic hyperintensity (arrow) along the dissection site.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mark E. Lindsay: This 47-year-old man pre- sented with pain on the left side of the head and neck. His medical history was notable for dyslip- idemia and a cerebellar stroke. The development of symptoms similar to those he had noticed before his stroke motivated his quick presentation to the hospital, where imaging studies revealed dissections of the left vertebral artery and right renal artery, with evidence of renal damage.\nIdentification of the cause of his first stroke had been complicated by other medical events at that time, given that the differential diagnosis of cerebellar stroke is somewhat broad. However, on the current evaluation, there was clear evi- dence of arterial dissections on imaging, which clarified that the primary medical issue was fragility of medium-sized arteries. With this fea- ture, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed through examination of the associated medical history, laboratory test results, and imaging findings.\nMinor Trauma\nCould this patient\u2019s vertebral artery dissection be associated with his history of chiropractic manipulation? There is a known association between cervical manipulative therapy and cervical artery dissection. Although dissections of the vertebral arteries and of the carotid artery have been reported in patients who have under- gone cervical manipulative therapy, the vertebral arteries are particularly vulnerable because of their position in the neck. During cervical ma- nipulative therapy, the V3 segment of the verte- bral artery is most susceptible to dissection be- cause rotation and extension stretch the vessel against the atlas or the posterior atlanto-occipi- tal membrane.1 It is often difficult to determine whether cervical artery dissection has resulted from cervical manipulative therapy on the basis of history alone, because neck pain could be a symptom of the dissection but could also be the reason that the patient initially sought therapy. This patient\u2019s neck pain had started before he underwent cervical manipulative therapy, but his stroke symptoms occurred afterward; thus, it is difficult to determine whether cervical manipu- lative therapy was the cause of his stroke symp- toms. However, the identification of renal artery dissection during his subsequent admission sug- gests that the patient had a more generalized problem of arterial fragility.\nVasculitis\nVasculitis is characterized by thickening of the vessel wall due to infiltration by inflammatory cells, which weakens the extracellular matrix and increases the risk of arterial stenosis, with dissection occurring in rare cases. Arterial dissec- tion has been associated with many forms of vasculitis \u2014 including polyarteritis nodosa, giant- cell arthritis, and Kawasaki\u2019s disease \u2014 but is a rare event.2 It occurs at a higher frequency (up to 11%) in patients with Takayasu\u2019s arteritis.3\nAlthough arterial dissection can occur in the context of these disorders, this patient had no other evidence of vasculitis, such as fever, malaise, weight loss, rash, or generalized, vague pain. In addition, he had no evidence of arterial wall thickening on imaging. Laboratory test results were not suggestive of vasculitis; tests for anti- nuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic an- tibodies, and anti-La and anti-Ro antibodies and a rapid plasma reagin test were negative, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was only mildly elevated. These findings make vasculitis an un- likely diagnosis in this patient.\n\nAtherosclerosis\nCould this patient\u2019s arterial dissections be an unusual consequence of a common disease? The most common vascular disorder, atherosclerotic vascular disease, can manifest as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Atherosclerosis is a multiregional disease that affects vascular beds, including those in the cervi- cal and abdominal areas. It is characterized by the formation of plaque that consists of fat, cho- lesterol, calcium deposits, and cellular infiltration in the arterial intima and media; it commonly causes vascular stenosis and regional arterial insufficiency. Vascular dissection can occur when plaque infiltrates and destabilizes the arterial media.\nAlthough this patient had a history of dyslipidemia, several features of his presentation are not consistent with a diagnosis of atherosclerosis. Dissection associated with atherosclerosis typi- cally involves large conduit arteries, such as the aorta, rather than smaller arteries. Also, it typi- cally occurs in older patients and involves vessels with clinically advanced disease. The absence of atherosclerotic plaque on imaging and the rela- tively young age of this patient make atheroscle- rosis an unlikely cause of his arterial dissections.\n\nFibromuscular Dysplasia\nFibromuscular dysplasia is a multiregional arteri- opathy that affects a younger patient population than typical atheromatous disease. Fibromuscular dysplasia is characterized by proliferation of in- tramural cells and deposition of loose, disorga- nized collagen in the arterial media. Collagen de- position generates fibromuscular ridges; areas of arterial stenosis alternate with areas of arterial dilatation caused by focal cellular loss. Alternat- ing stenoses and dilatations produce the charac- teristic \u201cbeads on a string\u201d appearance of fibro- muscular dysplasia on angiography.4\nThe typical manifestations of fibromuscular dysplasia include aneurysm, stenosis, and arterial dissection, and the typical affected territories are consistent with those involved in this patient\u2019s presentation. Approximately 20% of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia have arterial dissection; cervical and renal arterial dissections are the most common.5 However, some aspects of this case do not support a diagnosis of fibromuscu- lar dysplasia. The condition is much more com- mon in women than in men (9:1). Moreover, the characteristic \u201cbeads on a string\u201d appearance was not seen on imaging, nor were other findings consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia.\n\nGenetically Triggered Arterial Disease\nSeveral aspects of this case are suggestive of genetically triggered arterial disease. Recurrent arterial dissection is a characteristic feature of genetically mediated disease. Furthermore, the patient\u2019s age is consistent with the age at which dissection associated with genetically triggered arterial disease typically occurs. The history of major joint dysfunction and easy bruising, with repair of meniscus tears in both knees and repair of shoulder dislocation, may suggest a generalized abnormality of connective tissue.\nSeveral genes have been implicated in arterial dissection. The features of this patient\u2019s presenta- tion can help us to determine the gene involved. Mutations in ACTA2, MYH11, PRKG1, and MYLK,6 which are genes that encode regulators of smooth-muscle function, can cause arterial dis- ease, but manifestations are restricted to the car- diovascular system. These mutations would not cause joint or skin dysfunction and would thus be unlikely in this patient. The combination of arterial disease and joint dysfunction is com- monly seen in patients with Marfan syndrome, which is caused by mutations in FBN1, as well as in patients with Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome, which is caused by mutations in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, TGFB2, TGFB3, SMAD2, and SMAD3.7 In addition, arterial dissection and joint dysfunction can be related to deficits in collagen function induced by muta- tions in the genes that encode procollagen alpha chains. These include mutations in COL3A1,8 which encodes type III collagen, a major structural component of skin, blood vessels, and hollow organs; they less frequently include mutations in COL1A1.9 Mutations in COL5A1 and COL5A2 cause classic Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, a disorder that is infre- quently associated with arterial disease, although COL5A1 has recently been implicated in fibro- muscular dysplasia.10 In this case, there is no men- tion of a history of skin and joint hyperextensi- bility, which is the dominant phenotype of classic Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome. Arterial disease has also been associated with collagen-modifying enzymes, such as procollagen-lysine, 2-oxogluta- rate 5-dioxygenase 1, which is encoded by PLOD1, and lysyl oxidase, which is encoded by LOX. Mu- tations in PLOD1 cause severe joint manifesta- tions and scoliosis, features that are not compat- ible with this patient\u2019s history of manual labor. Other features of this case can help us to further narrow the list of diagnostic possibilities. Peripheral artery dissection is uncommon in patients with Marfan syndrome but is common in patients with Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome.11 That said, thoracic aortic aneurysm is a defining feature of Marfan syndrome12 and has high penetrance (>90%) in patients with Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome,11,13 as well as in patients with LOX-associated vascular disease.14 The findings on echocardiography in this case ruled out aneurysm involving the as-\ncending aorta or aortic root.\nIn view of all these factors and the overall frequency at which these mutations arise in the population, the most likely genetic diagnosis in this patient, who had recurrent dissection of medium-sized arteries and joint dysfunction in the absence of thoracic aortic aneurysm, is the vascular form of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, which is caused by mutations in COL3A1.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Joseph V. Thakuria: A clinical diagnosis of vascu- lar Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome can be established when a patient meets one of three major diag- nostic criteria: arterial dissection or rupture at a young age, unexplained intestinal rupture, or uterine rupture during pregnancy. Minor criteria that are suggestive of this diagnosis include a predilection for bruising or bruising at atypical sites, spontaneous pneumothorax, small-joint hypermobility, tendon or muscle rupture, early onset of varicose veins, or acrogeria. Patients with a known family history of vascular Ehlers\u2013Dan- los syndrome should be offered molecular testing before the onset of symptoms. Given this patient\u2019s history of left vertebral artery dissec- tion, right renal artery dissection, and preceding cerebral infarction, we strongly suspected the diagnosis of vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome.\nTraditional Sanger sequencing for COL3A1 was performed on a specimen obtained from the patient, and there was a plan to perform a reflex analysis with the use of multiplex ligation- dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and next- generation sequencing panel testing if Sanger sequencing was negative. In more than 95% of patients with vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, a mutation is identified with Sanger sequencing; in approximately 1%, a large deletion is identified by means of MLPA. Biochemical testing of cultured fibroblasts is primarily done to assess the functional effects of splice-site mutations.\nIn this patient, a mutation at nucleotide position 976 caused a substitution of cytosine for thymine that resulted in a change in coding for arginine to a termination codon (specifically, UGA in this case). Nucleotide triplets within messenger RNA can code for amino acids as well as termination codons (\u201cstop codons\u201d), which signal termination of protein translation and dissociation of ribosomal subunits. Humans have three termination codons in DNA (TAG, TAA, and TGA), with corresponding termination co- dons in RNA (UAG, UAA, and UGA). This muta- tion lies in exon 15, but COL3A1 is 51 exons in length and the protein is more than 1400 amino acids in length. The mutation causes early trun- cation of the transcription of procollagen. More than 600 pathogenic mutations are known to occur in COL3A1, and most are single amino acid substitutions of the glycine in the triple repeat of the triple helical domain of the type III procollagen, with approximately 25% occurring at splice sites.5 Null COL3A1 mutations may be associated with a slightly better prognosis than other known pathogenic COL3A1 mutations.\n",
