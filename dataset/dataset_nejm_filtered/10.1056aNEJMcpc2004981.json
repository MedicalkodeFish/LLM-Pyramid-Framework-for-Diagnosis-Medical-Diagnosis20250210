    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Rachel A. Meyen (Psychiatry): A 64-year-old Haitian-American man was evaluated at the geriatric psychiatry clinic of this hospital for chronic depression, intrusive thoughts, and fear of being poisoned.\nDuring the evaluation, the patient described his mood as \u201cnot that good.\u201d He reported depression, which he rated as 4 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe depression). He had been having an ongoing \u201cdepressive episode\u201d during the past 3 months, which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He had passive suicidal ideation, questioning whether life was worth living; how- ever, he had no specific intent or plan and no thoughts of harming other people. The patient had a history of nightmares, but they had not occurred during the past 3 months. In the 3 years before this evaluation, his startle response had been in- creased and flashbacks frequently occurred; however, at the time of the evaluation, his startle response was reduced and there were no flashbacks. He reported that women had attempted to poison his coffee. There were no auditory or visual hallu- cinations. He reported limited energy, difficulty initiating sleep, repeated early morning awakenings, and anorexia. There was no weight loss, difficulty concen- trating, or history of headaches, seizure, or head trauma.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, seasonal allergies, mild intermittent asthma, eczema, and chronic lower back pain associated with a motor vehicle accident that had occurred 20 years earlier. Medica- tions included bupropion, quetiapine, aspirin, atorvastatin, ezetimibe, amlodipine, fosinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and vitamins B12   and D3,  as well  as fexofenadine, naproxen, sildenafil, and inhaled albuterol as needed. Adverse drug effects included dry and painful mouth with paroxetine, reduced libido with par- oxetine and citalopram, orthostatic hypotension and falls with prazosin, nausea and vomiting with lisinopril, and elevated aminotransferase levels with statins.\nThe patient had a family history of dyslipidemia; his brother had died of pre- mature myocardial infarction, and his father had undergone coronary-artery bypass grafting. He had an adult child, who was healthy. There was no history of neuropsychiat- ric disease or substance use disorder in first- degree relatives, but male maternal cousins had major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. He worked full-time as a counselor. He visited a psychic every few weeks and was undergoing training to become a psychic and read tarot cards. He had formerly smoked a few cigarettes daily and had quit smoking when he was 30 years of age. He drank one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient grew up in Haiti. His parents were devout Catholics, but many community members and relatives observed Vodou and San- teria beliefs and also practiced tarot card read- ing; the patient and his siblings began following Vodou and Santeria practices during adoles- cence. In his early life, the patient witnessed an act of police brutality in which a community member was killed, as well as the poisoning of colleagues of his father, who was a government employee. In his early adulthood, the patient im- migrated to the United States. He lived in an urban area of New England, where he completed college and then worked as a counselor. He re- ported that he had experienced recurrent dis- crimination by female supervisors during his employment. In his early years of working, he encountered financial difficulties and was evicted from his apartment. During a 2-month period of homelessness, he became a victim of sexual and physical assault and subsequently had depressive symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts of the assault. He reported that he had not had any psychiatric symptoms before the assault.\nThe patient was married for a brief period and then divorced. He reported that his ex-wife had \u201cput a Vodou curse on me\u201d and that he had traveled to Haiti to have the curse removed but \u201cthe damage cannot be undone.\u201d For decades, he feared that female coworkers would try to poison him. For this reason, he did not drink coffee that had been unattended in the office, did not accept offers from coworkers to bring him coffee from a local shop, and avoided eating with col- leagues. He felt that people at work did not like him. He described extreme self-consciousness and was concerned that people in either a pro- fessional or social setting would see \u201cdiscolor- ation\u201d when they looked at his face.\n \nIn his early adulthood, the patient had sought weekly therapy at another hospital because of depressive symptoms, intrusive thoughts, and nightmares. Four years before the current con- sultation, and again 1 year later and 18 months after that, he sought care at psychiatry clinics at other hospitals. Meanwhile, he continued to re- ceive care from the same therapist for approxi- mately three decades.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s therapist. The persecutory beliefs had been long-standing, occurring over a period of decades; they became more prominent when depressive symptoms were more active, but they were still present during periods of euthymia. The therapist observed that the patient\u2019s perse- cutory beliefs affected interpersonal relation- ships and led to the feeling of isolation at work. The patient had undergone multiple trials of psychopharmacologic medications for the treat- ment of recurrent major depressive episodes, which would occur approximately two times each year and last for several weeks to months. These medications included nortriptyline, fluox- etine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalo- pram, escitalopram, bupropion, and valproic acid. He had tried prazosin, which decreased the fre- quency of nightmares but was discontinued ow- ing to orthostatic hypotension. He had under- gone EMDR (eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing) therapy, but nightmares occurred up to three times per month and intrusive thoughts of the sexual trauma occurred daily. Olanzapine and aripiprazole did not reduce paranoid thoughts; quetiapine had a modestly beneficial effect.\nOn examination, the patient was a well- groomed older man with no abnormal facial features. His posture and gait were normal. He was calm and cooperative, with normal eye con- tact and speech of an appropriate rate and vol- ume. He was oriented to time, place, and situa- tion, with intact attentiveness and ability to recall autobiographical and historical informa- tion. His mood was described as mildly sad and anxious with a constricted affect. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nOn laboratory testing performed at another hospital during the 6 months before the current evaluation, the complete blood count and results of renal-function tests were normal, as were lev- els of electrolytes, thyrotropin, and folate. The glucose level was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deci- liter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). The glycated hemoglobin level (7.0%; reference range, 4.3 to 6.4) had increased from a level of 6.4% obtained 6 months earlier. An electrocardiogram ob- tained 4 months before the current evaluation showed sinus rhythm with a normal corrected QT interval.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Nhi-Ha T. Trinh: This 64-year-old man with a clinically significant history of trauma \u2014 who had grown up in Haiti and observed practices and beliefs of Vodou, Santeria, and tarot card reading that were common in his community\n\u2014 presented with long-standing depression with limited energy, difficulty sleeping, and anorexia, all of which had led him to call in sick to work frequently. He also had had intrusive thoughts, a history of nightmares, and a fear of curses and of being poisoned since early adulthood. Despite these psychiatric symptoms, he was able to work, although he had limited interaction with his coworkers.\nThis case shows the challenges of evaluating older patients who come to psychiatric evalua- tions with an extensive patient history. Clini- cians must sort through the data and determine the importance of previous diagnoses and symp- toms with respect to current presenting symp- toms. In addition, this case shows the complex interplay of culture and psychiatry, as well as the factors that clinicians must consider when caring for patients with cultural backgrounds different from their own. Specifically, clinicians must consider when beliefs and practices suggest a psychiatric illness, and when they are culturally normative.\nIn constructing a differential diagnosis for this patient\u2019s constellation of symptoms, we should consider whether the symptoms together represent a medical illness, a psychiatric illness with culturally influenced symptoms, or a psy- chiatric illness with unrelated cultural beliefs.\nMedical Considerations\nCould a medical illness explain some of this patient\u2019s symptoms, including decreased energy, insomnia, and anorexia? Hypothyroidism and nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin B12 or fo- late deficiency can lead to such neurovegetative symptoms. The levels of thyrotropin and folate and the complete blood count were recently within normal limits, making these diagnoses unlikely. Although the patient reported con- sumption of one alcoholic beverage on weekend nights and did not use illicit drugs, it would be prudent to rule out a substance-related disorder that may be causing or exacerbating symptoms. Neurodegenerative disorders and cancer should also be considered in this case. To understand whether the patient had any deficits on physical or neurologic examination or had any memory decline or changes in behavior, habits, or per- sonality, it would be important to perform an additional review of systems (specifically to look for B symptoms \u2014 systemic symptoms of fever, night sweats, and weight loss), as well as to ob- tain collateral information from his therapist, primary care physician, family, and friends. The patient had not had any recent changes in mem- ory or behavior, and he had a normal physical examination and an unremarkable routine labo- ratory evaluation; these findings make a medical cause of this patient\u2019s presentation unlikely.\n\nPsychiatric Considerations\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an im- portant consideration in this case because of the patient\u2019s history of trauma \u2014 he had witnessed the killing and poisoning of community mem- bers in Haiti, experienced discrimination by super- visors at work, and been a victim of physical and sexual assault. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), defines PTSD as occurring after exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual vio- lence. To meet criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, a person must have the following symptoms for 1 month or more, with associated functional im- pairment: avoidance of trauma-related thoughts, feelings, or external reminders; at least one symptom of intrusion; at least two negative alter- ations in cognition or mood; and at least two alterations in arousal or reactivity.1 This patient had long-standing intrusive symptoms (frequent nightmares, daily intrusive thoughts, and flash- backs), alterations in mood (negative affect and decreased interest in activities), and alterations in arousal and reactivity (heightened startle response and difficulty concentrating and sleeping). He also had avoidance symptoms, such as not eat- ing with colleagues and isolating himself at work.\nIn addition, this patient had multiple episodes of recurrent mood and neurovegetative symp- toms that were consistent with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, recurrent type. Accord- ing to the DSM-5, patients with major depressive disorder have five or more neurovegetative symp- toms during the same 2-week period, which represent a change from previous functioning, with one of the symptoms being depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.1 Major de- pressive disorder and PTSD have overlapping symptoms and can occur concurrently (Fig. 1); the symptoms can be episodic or can wax and wane over time.1\nThe time course of depressive symptoms must be distinguished as either episodic, which would be consistent with major depressive disorder, or persistent, which would be consistent with per- sistent depressive disorder. A diagnosis of per- sistent depressive disorder would be considered in this case if the patient had had a depressed mood on most days for at least 2 years and had not been depression-free for more than 2 months at a time. However, because psychopharmaco- logic management had at times resulted in remission of depressive symptoms, a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is unlikely in this patient. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder is also unlikely, since the patient did not report cyclical mood episodes of hypomania or mania, but it would be important to obtain additional his- tory and collateral information to rule out this diagnosis.\nThe patient\u2019s decades-long history of persecutory thoughts has not yet been incorporated diagnostically. His fear of being poisoned by female coworkers substantially affected his daily inter- personal interactions and behaviors, his concern about his face being seen as discolored caused extreme self-consciousness, and his belief that his ex-wife had \u201cput a Vodou curse\u201d on him had led him to return to Haiti to have the curse re- moved.\nUnlike bizarre delusions, which have been described as beliefs that are characterized by their \u201cphysical impossibility or the cultural or historical incomprehensibility of the delusional claims,\u201d2 nonbizarre delusions are beliefs that are related to situations that could occur in real life but rely on misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences, reflecting a highly exaggerated interpretation of reality.1 In adolescence, this patient had witnessed an act of police brutality and poisoning of community members, and thus his fear of being poisoned could be conceptual- ized as hypervigilance against harm. In addi- tion, the idea of curses is part of a belief system that has been common in Haiti. Therefore, the patient\u2019s persecutory beliefs could represent non- bizarre delusions.\nThe patient\u2019s persecutory thoughts  became more prominent when his depressive symptoms were more active, and quetiapine therapy reduced these thoughts. Thus, his fear could be considered a symptom of major depressive disorder with psychotic features, which can lead to in- creased paranoia in the context of active depres- sion. In the absence of PTSD or major depressive disorder, a diagnosis of primary delusional disorder could be entertained, since people with delusional disorders may have nonbizarre delusions but otherwise continue to function. Other pri- mary psychotic disorders are unlikely, given that the patient did not have a history of bizarre delu- sions, disorganized speech, obviously odd behav- ior, hallucinations, or negative symptoms (e.g., a \u201cflattening\u201d of emotions, alogia, or avolition).\n\nCultural Considerations\nThe DSM-5 acknowledges and emphasizes the importance and primacy of culture: \u201call forms of distress are locally shaped, including the DSM disorders.\u201d1 Thus, what is \u201cnormal\u201d and what is \u201cpathologic\u201d may differ according to specific cultural norms and expectations. Although any patient may receive inappropriate treatment be- cause of cultural differences, immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities are disproportion- ately affected. In the United States, there is a history of misdiagnosing psychiatric conditions in racial and ethnic minorities. Immigrants of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds are more likely to receive a diagnosis of a psychotic disor- der than White nonimmigrants who present with similar psychiatric symptoms.3 On the other hand, because there is also a history of underdi- agnosing and undertreating medically diagnos- able psychiatric disorders in racial and ethnic minorities, if a minority patient were to present with beliefs that could represent clinically signifi- cant psychiatric symptoms, it would not be safe to assume that those beliefs are purely cultural.4 Clinicians must first consider treatable medi- cal and psychiatric causes of the symptoms and then find a balance between two extremes: the misdiagnosis of illness, and the minimization of a patient\u2019s beliefs as culturally normative. In this case, it is imperative to obtain additional infor- mation from the patient\u2019s family and friends, as well as from cultural (Haitian) and religious and spiritual (Vodou and Santeria) communities, to determine whether his beliefs originate fromcultural traditions.\n",
