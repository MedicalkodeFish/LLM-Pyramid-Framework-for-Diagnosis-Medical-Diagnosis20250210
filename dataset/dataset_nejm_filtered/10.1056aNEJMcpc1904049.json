    "Primary Symptom": "A 14-Month-Old Boy with Vomiting",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Batul Kaj: A 14-month-old boy was evaluated in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital because of vomiting.\nThe patient was born at another hospital to a 35-year-old mother by cesarean section because of arrest of the second stage of labor after an uncomplicated ges- tation of 39 weeks 6 days. At delivery, meconium was present. The 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores were both 9, and the birth weight was 2.9 kg (23rd percen- tile) (Fig. 1). Breast-feeding was initiated. The results of newborn blood-spot screening tests (a panel of tests for multiple congenital diseases, primarily inborn errors of metabolism) and screening tests for hearing ability and critical congeni- tal heart disease were normal, and the patient was discharged home on the fourth day of life.\nAt a routine pediatric examination when the patient was 14 days of age, the patient\u2019s mother reported that she had been breast-feeding him for 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours and that he was having yellow, seedy stools after each feeding. The weight was 2.7 kg. The patient\u2019s mother was advised to begin pumping breast milk and fortifying it with a cow\u2019s milk\u2013based infant formula to achieve a caloric content of 0.74 kcal per milliliter. Eight days later, the weight was 2.8 kg, and fortification to 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended.\nAt 26 days of age, the patient vomited a small amount of clotted blood, and his parents took him to the emergency department at another hospital. They reported that the baby had begun having frequent nonprojectile, nonbloody, nonbilious \u201cspit ups\u201d after the initiation of formula-fortified expressed breast milk. The physical examination was normal. A test of the stool was positive for occult blood. The patient was monitored overnight; he had no recurrent hematemesis and was discharged home the next day. At a follow-up visit with the pediatrician 9 days later, the weight was 2.8 kg, and the patient was referred to a pediatric gastroen- terologist at this hospital.\nThe patient was seen in the pediatric gastro- enterology clinic when he was 37 days of age. His mother reported that he had been consum- ing 60 ml of formula-fortified expressed breast milk every 2.5 hours. He had continued to have occasional small-volume emesis after feedings, but no additional episodes of hematemesis had occurred. Bowel movements had occurred after each feeding, and the stools were brown-green without visible blood or mucus. On examination, the infant was active and had a strong cry. The weight was 2.8 kg (<1st percentile), and the height was 55 cm (31st percentile). The abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, with normal bowel sounds. Rectal examination revealed guaiac- positive, brown stool; the remainder of the exam- ination was normal. A clinical diagnosis of aller- gy to cow\u2019s milk protein was made, and a hypoallergenic formula with a caloric content of 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended.\nAt a follow-up visit at the pediatric gastroen- terology clinic 3 weeks later, when the patient was 58 days of age, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the frequency of emesis had decreased and that stools had occasionally contained mucus but no blood. She reported that the baby had had nasal congestion and that she could hear a \u201cgur- gling\u201d sound during bottle-feeding. On exami- nation, the weight was 3.6 kg. Rectal examina- tion revealed soft, guaiac-positive stool with mucus; the remainder of the examination was normal. Transition to an amino acid\u2013based for- mula (also known as an elemental formula) with a caloric content of 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended.\nEight weeks later, when the patient was 16 hypoallergenic formula with a caloric content of 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended.\nAt a follow-up visit at the pediatric gastroen- terology clinic 3 weeks later, when the patient was 58 days of age, the patient\u2019s mother reported that the frequency of emesis had decreased and that stools had occasionally contained mucus but no blood. She reported that the baby had had nasal congestion and that she could hear a \u201cgur- gling\u201d sound during bottle-feeding. On exami- nation, the weight was 3.6 kg. Rectal examina- tion revealed soft, guaiac-positive stool with mucus; the remainder of the examination was normal. Transition to an amino acid\u2013based for- mula (also known as an elemental formula) with a caloric content of 0.81 kcal per milliliter was recommended.\nEight weeks later, when the patient was 16 weeks of age, he was brought back to the pedi- atric gastroenterology clinic because, during the preceding week, he had had several episodes of small-volume emesis with the vomitus contain- ing dark-brown material that his parents thought resembled blood. The weight was 4.6 kg; the remainder of the physical examination was nor- mal. Omeprazole was prescribed for the treat- ment of possible gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and preparation of the elemental for- mula to a caloric content of 0.88 kcal per milli- liter was recommended.\nAt a follow-up visit at the pediatric gastroenterology clinic 2 months later, when the patient was 6 months of age, his parents reported that he had seemed uncomfortable during feedings and had appeared to be increasingly hungry. The frequency of emesis had increased; he had been vomiting formula after approximately 75% of feedings. The weight was 6.2 kg; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. The dose of omeprazole was adjusted for the patient\u2019s cur- rent weight, and the introduction of age-appro- priate, dairy-free solid foods into his diet was recommended.\nOne  month  later,  when  the  patient was 7 months of age, his parents reported that he had continued to gain weight and that he had had no complications when they introduced soft foods, including cooked carrots, avocados, and bananas, into his diet. There had been no visible blood in the vomitus, and stools had appeared normal in color. Cow\u2019s milk protein was slowly reintroduced into his diet; he had no negative consequences, and treatment with omeprazole was discontinued.\nSix months later, when the patient was 13 months of age, his mother called the pediatric gastroenterologist and reported that the frequen- cy of vomiting had increased. Omeprazole was prescribed. At a follow-up visit in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic 5 weeks later, the patient\u2019s mother reported that she had stopped adminis- tering omeprazole to the patient after 2 weeks because it seemed not to have any effect. Imme- diately after eating each meal, the patient had appeared uncomfortable, retched, and then vomit- ed; at times, he had inserted his fingers into his mouth and appeared to induce vomiting. The vomitus often contained nearly everything the patient had just eaten, typically resembling his\nundigested food, without blood or bile. Emesis had occurred usually after consumption of pureed and solid foods and less frequently after con- sumption of milk. Shortly after vomiting, the patient usually requested more milk or food. Review of recent dietary records showed that the patient ate nearly every 30 minutes throughout the day, with typical meals including whole milk, a spoonful of oatmeal or banana, and rice puffs. Bowel movements occurred regularly twice per day; stools remained soft and did not contain visible blood or mucus.\nThe patient had met normal developmental milestones, and immunizations were up to date. At the 1-year health supervision visit with his pediatrician, the blood levels of hemoglobin and lead were normal. The patient had been receiv- ing a vitamin D supplement and had no known medication allergies. He lived with his parents in an urban area of New England. His mother had anemia, and his father and younger sister were healthy. A maternal aunt had hyperthyroid- ism, his maternal grandmother had pancreatitis, and his maternal grandfather had hypertension. On examination, the patient was active and ap- peared well. The weight was 6.9 kg. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without distention or tenderness. Rectal examination re- vealed guaiac-negative stool. The remainder of the examination was normal. The complete blood count and differential count were normal, as was the blood level of IgE antibodies to cow\u2019s milk.\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Carlo Di Lorenzo: This 14-month-old boy has had a lifelong struggle with two fairly common problems that occur in children: vomiting and insufficient weight gain. The symptoms have oc- curred since birth, and the infant has had some improvement in response to various interventions, a fact that may have clouded the clinical picture and consequently led to some delay in establish- ing the correct diagnosis. The tireless parental commitment to feeding the child at very fre- quent intervals with whatever the child was able to consume was critically important in keeping him relatively healthy. Initially, his symptoms were fairly nonspecific (vomiting is very com- mon in babies), and there was no apparent clue in the history, the findings on physical examina- tion, or the limited test results that pointed to an obvious diagnosis.\n\nFailure to Gain Weight\nIn a child who struggles to gain weight, the first step is to determine whether the child has ade- quate caloric intake and, if he does, whether he is losing weight as a result of vomiting or diar- rhea or is not able to use the nutritional intake effectively because of a genetic, endocrine, or metabolic disturbance. In this case, the baby was hungry and was accepting oral feedings, and there was no diarrhea. Vomiting was men- tioned early and often; thus, one could safely assume that the insufficient weight gain was related to frequent emesis. The central diagnos- tic question regarding this patient is why is he vomiting so often? More specifically, does he have a particularly severe presentation of a com- mon disease, or is there an unusual cause of the vomiting?\n\nVomiting in Infants\nThe differential diagnosis includes several major causes of vomiting in infants (Table 1). Deter- mining the characteristics of the emesis is very important in directing testing and treatment. Bilious vomiting, especially early in life, suggests the presence of an obstructive process distal to the ampulla, such as intestinal malrotation or vol- vulus. Forceful vomiting in an infant 2 to 3 months of age may be indicative of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Hematemesis may be caused by muco- sal injury from chronic or recurrent vomiting, a peptic ulcer, or a Mallory\u2013Weiss tear. When the vomiting is episodic and associated with a change\n \n\nSymptoms and Signs Associated with Vomiting\nThe presence of symptoms and signs associated with vomiting is of great clinical relevance. In a patient with acute vomiting, the occurrence of diarrhea is consistent with viral gastroenteritis and with infectious or allergic enteritis or coli- tis, and diarrhea could be a presenting symptom of enterocolitis associated with Hirschsprung dis- ease. Rectal bleeding suggests intussusception, infectious or allergic colitis, or, rarely in this pa- tient\u2019s age group, inflammatory bowel disease. Fever is associated with many causes of vomit- ing, including viral gastroenteritis and urinary tract infection. Recurrent pneumonia in an infant who vomits frequently may be caused by a tracheo- esophageal fistula. This patient did not have any of these symptoms. Occult blood was present in the stool on a couple of occasions, but this is a very nonspecific finding that may be related to any mucosal irritation throughout the gastroin- testinal tract.\nIn a child with poor weight gain and episodes\nof vomiting, the physical examination should include a detailed evaluation of the abdomen for signs of obstruction or focal tenderness, as well as a neurologic assessment. Hepatomegaly, sple- nomegaly, or jaundice may be caused by hepatitis, systemic viral infection, or metabolic disorders. Altered consciousness or neurologic abnormali- ties may be related to a mass in the central ner- vous system or an inborn error of metabolism. A bulging fontanelle in a neonate or young infant suggests the possibility of hydrocephalus. Finally, ambiguous genitalia may be suggestive of con- genital adrenal hyperplasia. None of these find- ings were present in this infant. His development was reported to be normal, and he had a vigor- ous cry and suck and a normal abdominal and neurologic examination on multiple occasions.\n\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Dietary Protein Allergy\nGiven the absence of associated symptoms and the reassuring physical examination, the medical providers appropriately considered and treated the child for GERD and dietary protein allergy, the most common causes of vomiting and fail- ure to thrive in infants. There is no easy way to confidently differentiate between these two con- ditions, which have overlapping symptoms. The symptoms of GERD are nonspecific and are oc- casionally associated with excessive irritability. Treatment with acid suppression often fails to reduce symptoms attributed to GERD in infants.1 Recent international guidelines have recommend- ed introducing a hypoallergenic infant formula before starting acid-suppression treatment in in- fants who have symptoms suggestive of GERD.2 Indeed, this was the approach taken by the phy- sicians caring for this child. In support of a diag- nosis of allergy to cow\u2019s milk protein, symptoms seemed to worsen with the introduction of cow\u2019s milk into his diet and abated briefly when he was given an elemental formula. Of note, the decrease in symptoms that occurs when elemen- tal formulas are given may be related to the physical characteristics of such formulas, which lead to faster gastric emptying than that seen with cow\u2019s milk, and does not necessarily indi- cate that the patient has an allergy to cow\u2019s milk protein.3\nOnce symptoms recurred despite the use of an elemental formula, treatment for GERD was instituted, and a transient abatement of symp- toms was noted. The natural history of GERD in infants is favorable; by 12 months of age, 95% of infants no longer have emesis.4 Thus, the per- sistence of vomiting in this child when he pre- sented at 13 months of age was not consistent with a diagnosis of GERD. He also had a vora- cious appetite, which may be suggestive of hypo- glycemia, a feature of hereditary fructose intoler- ance; however, his normal development and the normal physical examination did not support such a diagnosis.\nGiven that this patient had an early onset of symptoms, that he did not have symptom resolu- tion with acid suppression and dietary changes, and most important, that he was more likely to have symptoms with solid or soft foods than with liquids, the presence of an anatomical le- sion narrowing the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is likely. The occasional gurgling sounds noticed by his parents may suggest stasis of in- gested material above an obstructive lesion. Ana- tomical lesions may be congenital or acquired, but in a 14-month-old child, acquired lesions \u2014 such as an esophageal peptic stricture from poorly controlled GERD, a stenosis related to eosinophilic esophagitis, or the development of esophageal achalasia \u2014 are extremely uncom- mon. More distal lesions, such as antral webs, rarely cause such immediate and severe symp- toms as those seen in this case. The onset of discomfort soon after eating and the vomiting of undigested food are suggestive of a proximal lesion, such as an esophageal stenosis. Thus, I think that this child has a congenital esophageal stenosis (CES), and the diagnostic test that is most likely to elucidate this diagnosis is an upper gastrointestinal series.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Michael S. Gee: An upper gastrointestinal series showed focal narrowing of a short segment of the distal thoracic esophagus (Fig. 2A). The pas- sage of contrast material beyond this narrowing was delayed, and intraesophageal reflux was ob- served proximal to the narrowing (Fig. 2B) when the patient was in the lateral decubitus position. The duodenojejunal junction was in a normal position (Fig. 2C), which ruled out malrotation. Distal to the narrowing, there was poststenotic dilatation and subtle vertical striations (Fig. 2D) that were most consistent with gastric folds in a sliding hiatal hernia. However, the position of the esophageal narrowing never changed during the examination, a finding that raised the pos- sibility of a congenital or acquired esophageal stenosis.\nDr. Kumar Krishnan: Because of the concern\nabout esophageal stenosis, an upper endoscopy was performed. A stenosis was encountered 18 cm from the incisors (Fig. 3A). The mucosa was normal in this area. A guidewire was advanced through the stenosis under fluoroscopic guid- ance, and a balloon catheter was advanced over the wire; contrast material was injected to assess the length of the stricture. The stricture mea- sured approximately 1 cm in length, and the distal esophagus had a normal appearance. Dila- tion of the esophageal stricture was attempted with a 4-mm hydrostatic balloon; no dilatation was observed. Dilation was then attempted with an 8-mm balloon. A waist (i.e., an indentation on the balloon corresponding to the location of the stricture) was noted on the balloon on fluoros- copy. The waist did not disappear completely, indicating that dilatation was inadequate. After the dilation procedure (Fig. 3B), there was mild improvement in the stricture, as evidenced by a slight increase in the luminal diameter, without any mucosal disruption.\nDr. Allan M. Goldstein: After the unsuccessful attempt to dilate the stenosis and after extensive discussion with the parents, the decision was made to perform laparoscopic resection of the esophageal stricture (see the video, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The patient had no complications during the surgical procedure and had a normal recovery after the procedure. On postoperative day 4, up- per gastrointestinal imaging with contrast en- hancement showed no anastomotic leak. A liquid diet was started, and the next day, the patient was advanced to a diet of soft foods and was discharged home.\n\n",
