    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kathleen M. McFadden (Medicine): An 84-year-old man was admitted to this hos- pital after having a fall.\nThree weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital because of a transient episode of gross hematuria. Urinalysis showed trace blood (reference value, negative), and micro- scopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 4 or 5 red cells per high- power field (reference range, 0 to 3). Results of tests of coagulation were normal, and the complete blood count showed anemia, which had been diagnosed previously and was stable as compared with findings obtained 11 months earlier. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, performed after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, reportedly showed a linear density in the bladder that measured 10 mm in diameter. The cause of the episode of hematuria was thought to be a kidney stone that had passed into the bladder. The patient was discharged home with a plan to follow up in the urology clinic affiliated with the other hos- pital; he was instructed to continue treatment with rivaroxaban, which he had been taking for many years to prevent stroke in the context of atrial fibrillation.\nOne week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of the other hospital after he had expressive aphasia as well as numbness on the right side of his face and in his right arm, which had resolved before he arrived at the emergency department. He had missed multiple doses of rivaroxaban in the 2 weeks before the onset of these symptoms. CT angiography of the head and neck reportedly did not show evidence of stroke or clinically sig- nificant stenosis in the anterior or posterior cerebral circulation. The complete blood count showed that his anemia remained stable. The blood levels of electrolytes, ala- nine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed 1+ blood, and micro- scopic examination of the urinary sediment revealed 6 to 10 red cells per high- power field and 6 to 9 white cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2).\nThe patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed moderate generalized atrophy and small- vessel ischemic changes. Transthoracic echocar- diography (TTE) showed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, increased estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and intact in- traventricular and atrial septa. The patient was told that his symptoms were due to a transient ischemic attack, and he was discharged home with instructions to continue taking rivaroxaban and with a plan to follow up in the neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital.\nOn the day of the current presentation, the patient fell in his bathroom at his home. Emergency medical services were called. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deci- liter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). The patient was not able to recall the events that led to the fall.\nHe was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported that he had felt unwell after discharge from the other hospital, with symptoms including gen- eralized weakness and dizziness. He had no ab- dominal pain, chest pain, or urinary symptoms. His wife reported that before the patient\u2019s admis- sion to the other hospital, he had been completely independent, performing activities such as driving and grocery shopping. However, since his dis- charge from the other hospital, he had become progressively weaker and had required assistance with walking and dressing. The patient\u2019s wife also reported an area of redness on the patient\u2019s left arm where an intravenous catheter had been placed during admission to the other hospital.\nOther medical history included atrial fibrillation, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, hypertension, and prostate cancer that had been treated with radiotherapy. Medications included amlodipine, finasteride, furosemide, losartan, rivaroxaban, rosuvastatin, and venlafaxine. The patient had no known drug allergies. He did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs; he smoked one pack of cigarettes per day. He was retired and lived in Massachusetts with his wife.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 145/68 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 24.4. The patient appeared ill with dry mucous membranes. The heart sounds were irregular. There was an area of erythema overlying the left antecubital fossa with mild induration but no fluctuance. He had an abrasion over the left knee. He was coop- erative but confused and intermittently answered questions inappropriately; he occasionally stared off into space and did not respond to questions. The remainder of the examination was normal. The blood levels of electrolytes, alanine ami- notransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alka- line phosphatase, and lactate were normal, as were the results of tests of coagulation. Uri- nalysis showed 3+ blood (reference value, nega- tive) and 3+ leukocyte esterase (reference value, negative); microscopic evaluation of the urinary sediment revealed 5 to 10 red cells per high- power field (reference range, 0 to 2), more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10), and 1+ bacteria. The blood level of creatinine was 2.01 mg per deciliter (178 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T 68 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Tests for respiratory viruses, including severe acute respiratory syn- drome coronavirus 2, were negative. An electro- cardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. Imaging studies were\nobtained.\nDr. Brian B. Ghoshhajra: CT angiography of the head and cervical spine showed no acute intra- cranial hemorrhage or evidence of an acute in- farct and no acute fracture in the cervical spine. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was also performed. A small pleural effusion was detected in the left lung (Fig. 1A). Moderate-to- severe coronary-artery calcification with multi- chamber cardiomegaly was present, and calcifications were scattered throughout the thoracic aorta, which showed aneurysmal dilatation (Fig. 1D). An indeterminate left adrenal nodule that measured 15 mm in diameter was detected, along with cir- cumferential wall thickening in the urinary blad- der and two stones in the urinary bladder that measured up to 5 mm in diameter; seeds from previous brachytherapy were also visible (Fig. 1C). Two focal areas of hyperdensity, each measuring up to 6 mm in diameter, that were seen along the posterior aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae were most likely meningiomas (Fig. 1A and 1B). There was a focal outpouching of the aorta supe- rior to the origin of the celiac artery and mural thickening of the aorta at the level of the aortic hiatus with adjacent fat stranding (Fig. 1D).\nDr. McFadden: While the patient was in the emergency department, the high-sensitivity tro- ponin T levels, which were checked 1 and 3 hours after the initial troponin measurement, were 71 ng per liter and 70 ng per liter, respectively. A bolus of 500 ml of normal saline was administered. A presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection was made, and urine was obtained for culture. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was ini- tiated, and the patient was admitted to the hos- pital. Treatment with furosemide and losartan was stopped, but his other home medications were continued.\nOn hospital day 1, the urine culture grew more than 100,000 colony-forming units of Staphylococ- cus aureus. MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, was degraded by motion artifact, but there was no evidence of an acute infarct. A TTE showed an LVEF of 60%, a dilated right ventricle with normal systolic function, mild-to-moderate aortic regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and an elevated estimated right ventricular systolic pressure. Blood was ob- tained for culture, and treatment with ceftriaxone was continued.\nOn hospital day 2, the patient remained afebrile. An ultrasound image of the left antecubital fossa showed an avascular hypoechoic collection, measuring 1.7 cm by 0.5 cm by 1.3 cm, overlying a partially occluded superficial vein. The patient was evaluated by the orthopedic surgery consultant; no surgical intervention was recommended. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the urine culture isolate revealed methicillin-sensitive S. au- reus (MSSA). Treatment with ceftriaxone was stopped, and treatment with intravenous vanco- mycin and cefazolin was initiated. Blood cultures obtained on hospital day 1 grew gram-positive cocci in clusters in one of four bottles. Additional blood cultures were obtained.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient had sudden chest pain while resting in bed. The pain was located over the left third intercostal space and did not radiate; the patient rated the pain at 5 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain lasted 5 minutes and re- solved without intervention. On evaluation by the treating physician immediately after the pain re- solved, the blood pressure was 193/80 mm Hg. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation without ischemic changes. A chest radiograph showed a small left pleural effusion similar to that previously seen on CT angiography and a confluent retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe. The blood level of high-sensitivity troponin T was 46 ng per liter. Treatment with losartan, which had been stopped on admission to the hospital, was restarted. Dur- ing the next 12 hours, the blood pressure de- creased to 167/81 mm Hg.\nOn hospital day 4, the patient had chest pain\nthat was different in character from the pain he had had the previous day. The pain, which he rated at 10, radiated into the abdomen. The patient ap- peared distressed. The blood pressure was 173/85 mm Hg. The pain was unchanged on palpation over the chest and abdomen. Treatment with low- dose intravenous hydromorphone was initiated, and the pain decreased to 5 out of 10. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1. Initial CT Angiogram of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis.\nMultiplanar reformatted images (Panels A and B) show two bony masses along the posterior aspect of the spinal canal at the level of the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae that each measure up to 6 mm in diameter (arrows); both masses are spherical with flat and wide bony bases along the posterolateral spine and, on the basis of their location and characteristics, are thought to be calcified meningiomas. A coronal multiplanar reformatted image (Panel C) shows an indeterminate left adrenal nodule, measuring 15 mm in diameter (black arrow), and circumferential wall thickening in the urinary bladder (white arrow), along with two stones in the urinary bladder, measuring up to 5 mm in diameter; seeds from previous brachytherapy are also seen. A sagittal reformatted image from the same imaging study (Panel D) shows diffuse atherosclerotic plaque throughout all segments of the aorta, with aneurysmal dilata\u2011 tion in all segments of the thoracic aorta; a focal outpouching of the aorta superior to the origin of the celiac artery and mural thickening of the aorta at the level of the aortic hiatus with adjacent fat stranding are also seen (arrow).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Zaven Sargsyan: In constructing a differential diagnosis, we typically consider conditions that can explain all the patient\u2019s findings at once. In this case, however, it would be useful to consider narratives that can explain the findings as a se- quence of events. This mindset recognizes that various complications that are not inherent to a single disease process are ubiquitous and may not be included in common illness scripts used in clinical reasoning. For example, pneumonia does not cause knee swelling until its accompa- nying encephalopathy results in a fall. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease does not cause urinary retention until enough of an inhaled anticholinergic drug has been used. With this in mind, I would summarize this patient\u2019s presen- tation as follows.\nA vibrant older man with hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation had acute transient hematuria resulting from a bladder stone, which led him to stop taking rivaroxaban consistently. He subsequently had a transient neurologic syn- drome consistent with occlusion of the left mid- dle cerebral artery, which prompted brief hospi- talization. In the week after his discharge, he became progressively ill, exhibiting encephalopa- thy, and there was redness at the site of his re- cent peripheral intravenous catheter. He was found to have thrombophlebitis with cellulitis and ab- scess, S. aureus bacteriuria, a positive blood culture, and multiple abnormalities on cross-sectional im- aging, including aortic wall thickening and out- pouching. He then suddenly had severe chest pain radiating to his abdomen.\nWhen analyzing a case with many unknown\nfactors, one approach is to start from relative certainty and see whether what we know can help clarify what we don\u2019t know.\n\nPhlebitis, Cellulitis, and Abscess\nThe patient had peripheral intravenous catheterassociated phlebitis, soft-tissue infection, and a probable bacterial abscess. Phlebitis is a common complication of peripheral intravenous catheters, occurring in 50% of cases by day 4 after place- ment.1 Infections are more common when catheters are placed during emergency situations, such as when this patient presented to the emergency department with a possible stroke. Furthermore, a majority of skin abscesses are caused by S. aureus, which is an important consideration in light of the results of this patient\u2019s urine culture.2\n\nS. aureus Bacteriuria\nOn hospital day 1, the urine culture grew S. aureus, which is unusual. In patients without urethral or suprapubic catheters, S. aureus typically infects the urine by hematogenous spread rather than from an ascending infection. The presence of S. aureus in the urine is usually assumed to be caused by a bloodstream infection, until proven otherwise.3 Appropriately, blood cultures were obtained after the results of the urine culture became available.\n\nGram-Positive Cocci in Blood\nOn hospital day 2, gram-positive cocci were iden- tified in one blood-culture bottle. Although the results are preliminary, this development sup- ports a presumption of staphylococcal bacteremia in the context of staphylococcal bacteriuria. Al- together, the findings make a compelling case for a diagnosis of S. aureus bacteremia, with the arm infection as the source.\n\nExplaining Additional Findings\nThe term metastatic S. aureus infection, which likens the behavior of the organism to cancer, is poignant and appropriate. The propensity of\nS. aureus to spread and grow at distant sites makes it critical to consider all concurrent abnormalities as being potentially related. This patient had acute kidney injury, encephalopathy, an adrenal nod- ule, masses along the spinal canal, worsening cardiomyopathy, and aortic outpouching. Are these unexplained findings related to the pre- sumed S. aureus bacteremia, coincidental, or clues to an altogether different case narrative?\nThe prevalence of specific diagnoses often fac- tors into clinicians\u2019 probabilistic reasoning. The prevalence of abnormalities is similarly important to consider. For instance, chronic genital ulcers are not a common finding, and in a person with a more prevalent and nonspecific symptom like fatigue, such a finding should be assumed to be a signal rather than coincidental noise. The degree of relatedness between two clinical entities also informs interpretation. For instance, acute dyspnea and acute cough are almost always caused by the same process (high overlap). By contrast, chronic dyspnea and chronic knee pain are more likely to be separate processes, even though some uni- fying causes are possible. This reasoning can be represented by Venn diagrams, in which circles vary in size (representing prevalence) and in the degree of overlap. Figure 2 shows such an analy- sis for this patient\u2019s unexplained findings relative to S. aureus bacteremia.\nOverall, the findings involving the aorta in this patient are critical to investigate further. They are not adequately understood, cannot be dis- missed as incidental, and are potentially life- threatening. The mural thickening, along with surrounding fat stranding, suggests an inflam- matory process, with possible aneurysmal dila- tation as an evolving complication. Aortitis can be caused by sterile inflammation (e.g., giant-cell arteritis or Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease) or infection. S. aureus is the most common cause of infectious aortitis and pseudoaneurysm.6\nAdditional aortic imaging is indicated. How- ever, a parallel step may be a review of the initial imaging findings with radiology colleagues with consideration of the newly available information that the patient probably has S. aureus bactere- mia. Diagnosis is an iterative process for bedside clinicians, and this can also be the case for radiologists. At the time of the initial CT study, the clinical context was a fall. The new context of bacteremia may lead to an entirely different interpretation. Thus, the value of reviewing im- aging with radiologists is not only to gain more granularity and a more clear explanation but also to update them on the clinical course and see whether the same images mean something differ- ent now.\nDevelopment of Sudden Chest Pain\nIn this patient\u2019s case, we must filter the usual differential diagnosis for chest pain through a context of presumed S. aureus bacteremia. In pri- oritizing possible diagnoses, we must consider the prevalence, clinical fit, and importance of timely diagnosis on the basis of the severity of the con- dition and potential treatments.\n\nStress-Induced Cardiomyopathy\nThe possibility of stress-induced cardiomyopathy was first considered when the patient\u2019s echocardio- gram showed a reduced LVEF. It is indeed com- mon: in one series involving 92 patients without a history of cardiac disease who were admitted to an intensive care unit, routine echocardiograms showed left ventricular dysfunction with apical ballooning in 26% of the patients.7 The patients with ballooning had higher troponin levels and more ECG abnormalities than those without bal- looning. This patient did not have these additional signals, and his pain features would not be typical of stress-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\nCoronary Occlusion\nThe patient\u2019s imaging studies showed atheroscle- rosis and thus a reason for the development of acute coronary syndrome now; the incidence of myocardial infarction has been reported to be as high as 7 to 8% among patients with certain bacte- rial infections, mediated by oxidative damage and a prothrombotic state of infection.8 Endocarditis must also be considered as a possible diagnosis because valvular vegetations can rarely embolize to the coronary arteries.9 Repeat ECG and mea- surement of troponin levels are indicated.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\nThe occurrence of pulmonary embolism is always a possibility in a hospitalized patient with sud- den chest pain. The character of chest pain can vary greatly, and none of the vital sign abnormali- ties that trigger concern about pulmonary embo- lism are sufficiently sensitive to reduce suspicion when they are absent. It is helpful to recall which component of the Wells risk prediction score for pulmonary embolism carries the most weight, with 3 points indicating that alternative diagnoses are less likely than pulmonary embolism.10 The degree of suspicion for pulmonary embolism in this patient is modulated by the probability of other possible diagnoses. \nThoracic Radiculopathy\nIn a prospective study involving 115 patients with gram-positive bacteremia, routine performance of positron-emission tomography revealed spondylodiskitis in 10% of the patients.11 Paravertebral infections in the thoracic spine can compress nerve roots and manifest with thoracic pain. The intermittent nature of this patient\u2019s pain and the radiation of the pain down and across dermatomes would not be typical of tho- racic radiculopathy.\n\nPneumonia\nIn the same study involving patients with gram- positive bacteremia, pulmonary abscesses were identified in 14% of the patients.11 The chest pain occurred several days after the patient\u2019s last cross-sectional imaging of the chest, and pneumonia could have developed during that time. However, severe chest pain caused by pneumonia is usually pleuritic in nature, which was not the case in this patient.\n\nParasternal Septic Arthritis\nThe sternoclavicular joint is a common site of sep- tic arthritis in patients with S. aureus bacteremia. However, this patient\u2019s pain did not worsen on palpation of the chest.\n\nAortitis with Acute Aortic Syndrome\nThe findings on CT performed in the emergency department prompted concern about the aorta, and the chest pain elevates an acute aortic syn- drome to the top of the differential diagnosis. Acute aortic syndromes include dissection, intra- mural hematoma, penetrating ulcer, and rup- tured aneurysm. This patient had additional risk factors for an acute aortic syndrome, in- cluding uncontrolled hypertension, atheroscle- rosis, and aortopathy. His severe, acute pain, which radiated from the chest to the abdomen and was unaffected by palpation, has no clear alternative cause and is highly suggestive of aortitis and an acute aortic syndrome. I would obtain repeat aortic imaging, with a specific focus on infectious pseudoaneurysm with im- pending or ongoing rupture.\n\n\n\n\n",
