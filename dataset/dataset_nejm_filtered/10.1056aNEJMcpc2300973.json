    "Primary Symptom": "A 79-Year-Old Man with Involuntary Movements and Unresponsiveness",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Carrie Chui (Neurology): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital  because of involuntary movements on the left side and transient unresponsiveness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 months before admis- sion, when involuntary movements of the left shoulder and left side of the face developed. The movements were described by the patient as twitching, were not associated with a change in the level of consciousness, and resolved after 1 to 2 minutes. During the next 6 months, the patient had similar episodes approxi- mately once per month, but the episodes increased in duration, lasting 5 to   6 minutes.\nThree months before admission, the episodes of involuntary movements in- creased in frequency, and the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal. Results of kidney-function tests were nor- mal, as were blood levels of glucose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 129 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145).  There  was a history  of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and the sodium level was similar to levels obtained during the past 4 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a focus of enhancement in the right middle frontal gyrus that was thought to be a small vascular anomaly. Electroencephalography (EEG), performed with the patient in awake and drowsy states, revealed rare, brief, focal slowing in the left temporal lobe during drowsiness; no epileptiform abnor- malities were present.\nTwo months before admission, the patient was evaluated in the epilepsy clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported that the episodes of involuntary move- ments had increased in both frequency and duration, occurring once or twice per day and lasting approximately 10 minutes. Episodes began with tingling and numbness in the left leg that prompted the patient to voluntarily stomp the left foot to relieve the uncomfortable sensation. Then, the patient had involuntary movements that he described as an uncontrollable invisible force moving the left leg and arm, with hyperex- tension of the arm backward and pronation of the wrist. There was associated numbness in the distal portions of the left third, fourth, and fifth fingers and involuntary movement of the left cheek. No prodromal symptoms occurred. The patient had awareness during the episodes, and after the episodes, he felt fatigued but had a normal level of consciousness, without confu- sion. The examination in the epilepsy clinic was normal. A diagnosis of seizure disorder was considered, and treatment with levetiracetam was started.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was again evaluated in the epilepsy clinic. He reported that the episodes of involuntary movements still occurred on a daily basis but had decreased in duration and involved only the left leg, without abnormal movements of the arm or face. Dizzi- ness, headache, and weakness had developed and were attributed to the use of levetiracetam.\n\nThe patient\u2019s family had recorded a video of one of the episodes of involuntary movements. After reviewing the video, the patient\u2019s neurologist thought that the episodes were less likely to be caused by seizures and more consistent with choreoathetoid movements. Cross-tapering of medications \u2014 with the simultaneous adminis- tration of levetiracetam in decreasing doses and clobazam in increasing doses \u2014 was initiated, and the patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic affiliated with this hospital.\nOn the morning of admission, an episode of involuntary movements of the left leg and left shoulder occurred and persisted for 1 hour. Sev- eral hours after the symptoms abated, the pa- tient\u2019s wife found the patient to be unresponsive; he was sitting in a chair. Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was responsive. The fingerstick blood glu- cose level was 180 mg per deciliter (10.0 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evalu- ation.\n\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported dysuria and increased urinary frequency. The patient\u2019s daughter noted that he had been more anxious during the past 3 years and occa- sionally had trouble with memory. Other medi- cal history included Barrett\u2019s esophagus, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, eczema, gastroesophageal reflux dis- ease, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopa- thy, and osteoporosis. There was no history of head trauma or extended loss of consciousness. Medications included aspirin, atorvastatin, doxa- zosin, finasteride, omeprazole, metoprolol, sacu- bitril, and valsartan. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely; he did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had gastric cancer, and his sister had had esophageal cancer; there was no family history of seizures.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature\nwas 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 152/97 mm Hg, the pulse 65 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 96% while the patient was breathing am- bient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.7. The blood pressure decreased to 130/63 mm Hg with standing. The patient was alert and interactive. The lower jaw was held to the left, but the nasolabial folds and smile were symmetric with activation. There were non- rhythmic, nonstereotyped, writhing movements of the left arm. Tone was normal, and strength was assessed as 5 out of 5 in the arms and legs. Results of liver-function and kidney-function tests were normal, as were blood levels of glu- cose and electrolytes, except for the sodium level, which was 125 mmol per liter. The lactate level was 2.1 mmol per liter (19 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [5 to  18 mg per deciliter]). The urinalysis was normal. Intravenous fluids were administered. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Rajiv Gupta: Computed tomographic  (CT)\nangiography of the head and neck (Fig. 1B) re- vealed extensively calcified plaque with severe stenosis of the distal right common carotid ar- tery (CCA), extending into the proximal right internal carotid artery (ICA), as well as stenosis of the right and left paraclinoid ICAs and the left vertebral artery at its origin. There was no vas-\n \n\ncular abnormality on the CT angiogram that corresponded to the abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus seen on the previous MRI. Dr. Chui: The patient was admitted to the hos- pital. On the second hospital day, the sodium level had increased to 130 mmol per liter, and the lactate level was normal. Additional imaging\nstudies were obtained.\nDr. Gupta: MRI of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction. The focus of enhancement in the right frontal lobe that had been noted previ- ously was not seen on the current MRI.\nDr. Chui: Blood levels of thyrotropin, cobala- min, and glycated hemoglobin and results of coagulation tests were normal. Screening tests for Lyme disease, tuberculosis, and syphilis were negative, as were tests for antibodies to cardio- lipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein. A test for antinuclear\nantibodies was positive, at a titer of 1:160  in a\nhomogeneous pattern. During a physical therapy session, the patient had abnormal movements of the left leg, left arm, and left side of the face. The abnormal movements diminished when the patient used distraction techniques, such as thigh tapping, finger snapping, and walking while holding a glass of water.\nThe transient unresponsiveness that led to the patient\u2019s admission was attributed to a com- bination of sedation from clobazam and hypovo- lemia. Treatment with clobazam was stopped, and hydration was encouraged. A diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder was considered; outpatient physical therapy with continued use of distraction techniques was recommended. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.\nEpisodes of involuntary movements contin- ued to occur on a daily basis at home. Two weeks after discharge, when the patient was doing exercises while sitting in a chair and hav- ing a conversation with his wife, he suddenly stopped talking. She found him slumped in the chair with his eyes closed, no longer exercising. When she asked him questions, he repeatedly said \u201cyes.\u201d Emergency medical services were called, and when they arrived, the patient was alert, diaphoretic, and nonverbal. He had a facial droop on the left side and a right gaze prefer- ence. The fingerstick blood glucose level was 130 mg per deciliter (7.2 mmol per liter) and the blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg. The patient was transported to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 143/63 mm Hg, the pulse 66 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and interac- tive. There was a facial droop on the left side. There was no effort against gravity in the left arm. The patient was able to lift the left leg off the bed for 1 to 2 seconds. He had a right gaze deviation that could not be overcome and mild dysarthria. The remainder of the examination was normal. A diagnosis of stroke was considered, and emergency CT angiography was performed.\nDr. Gupta: CT angiography showed no  evidence of acute territorial infarction and no changes in cerebrovascular disease.\nDr. Chui: On repeat physical examination performed after CT angiography, the gaze deviation and dysarthria had resolved, and strength was normal. Mild facial paralysis was present.\n\nFigure 2 (facing page). Additional Cardiac Diagnostic Studies.\nOne day after the out\u2011of\u2011hospital cardiac arrest, a transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) image obtained from a parasternal long\u2011axis window (Panel A) shows a ventricular septal rupture (arrow); a percutaneous left ventricular assist device is in place. A TTE image obtained with color Doppler (Panel B) shows exten\u2011 sive left\u2011to\u2011right shunting across the ventricular septal rupture during ventricular systole. In a photograph obtained during surgical repair (Panel C), the apex of the heart is reflected cephalad, and a ventriculotomy established to the left of the posterior descending coronary artery provides access to the infarct zone; the ventricular septal rupture is visible through a left ventriculotomy (arrow). After resuscitation was per\u2011 formed for a subsequent in\u2011hospital cardiac arrest, an electrocardiogram (Panel D) shows sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopic beats, ST\u2011segment elevations of up to 6 mm in the inferior leads, and 5\u2011mm ST\u2011 segment depressions in the lateral and precordial leads. A transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) image obtained from the midesophageal four\u2011chamber view (Panel E) shows a ruptured papillary muscle of the mitral valve, as evidenced by the presence of papil\u2011 lary muscle tissue in the left atrium (asterisk) during systole. A TEE image obtained with color Doppler from the midesophageal long\u2011axis view, at a different omni\u2011 plane angle (Panel F), shows severe mitral regurgita\u2011 tion due to the papillary muscle rupture.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Albert Y. Hung: This 79-year-old man initially presented with involuntary movements of the left shoulder and face without associated loss of consciousness. Diagnosis of an unusual move- ment disorder, especially one that is present epi- sodically, can be challenging. Videos brought in by the patient can be very useful.1 Most move- ment disorders result from abnormal function- ing of extrapyramidal circuits involving the basal ganglia, rather than a specific neuroana- tomical lesion, and the first step toward diagno- sis is to identify the type of abnormal move- ments.2\nFour salient aspects of this patient\u2019s involuntary movements can help in characterizing the movement disorder before generating a differen- tial diagnosis. First, the movements were parox- ysmal, lasting for short periods of time with resolution between episodes. Second, the move- ments were nonstereotyped, appearing random- ly and variably. Third, the movements were re- stricted to the left side of his body throughout the course, localizing the disease process to the right  cerebral  hemisphere.   Finally,  the  symptoms were progressive, increasing in both dura- tion and frequency.\n\nMovement Disorders\nThis patient had abnormal involuntary move- ments, symptoms indicative of a hyperkinetic movement disorder. Tremor, the most common hyperkinetic disorder, is unlikely because the patient did not have rhythmic movements. Dys- tonia is also unlikely, because he did not have sustained muscle contractions that were causing twisting or abnormal postures of the legs, arms, head, neck, or face. Although the patient ini- tially described the movements as twitching, his later descriptions are not suggestive of myoclo- nus or tics, which manifest as sudden, rapid, recurrent movements.\nThis patient\u2019s neurologist described the invol- untary movements as \u201cchoreoathetoid\u201d after re- viewing a video of an episode. Chorea, athetosis, and ballism make up a spectrum of involuntary movements that often occur in combination. Chorea refers to involuntary movements that are \u201cdancelike\u201d \u2014 irregular, random, unintended, and flowing from one body part to another. When these movements are slow and writhing (with a lower amplitude) and involve the distal limbs, the term athetosis is used. The presence of both chorea and athetosis in the same patient is referred to as choreoathetosis. When the movements are fast and flinging (with a higher amplitude) and involve the proximal limbs, the term ballism is used. Although the description of this patient\u2019s movements was not clearly sug- gestive of ballism, hemichorea and hemiballis- mus often occur together.\nThe term dyskinesia can refer to any abnor- mal movements and is often used to describe hyperkinetic disorders that are induced by spe- cific drugs, such as tardive dyskinesia induced  by dopamine antagonists or dyskinesia induced by levodopa in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Often, dyskinesia manifests as chorea or choreo- athetoid movements, but chorea and dyskinesia are not synonymous. This patient appears to have involuntary dyskinesia with choreoatheto- sis as the primary phenomenology. Before con- structing a differential diagnosis for dyskinesia  in this patient, I will consider two conditions that mimic dyskinesia: seizures and functional movement disorder.\nSeizures\nVarious movement disorders may be mistaken for seizures, although these movement disorders are not associated with EEG abnormalities dur- ing the episode. Patients with some forms of epilepsy may present with abnormal movements without other features that are typically associ- ated with seizures, such as aura, change in re- sponsiveness, incontinence, or a postictal state.3,4 Seizures were initially suspected in this patient, and he was referred to the epilepsy clinic. Recur- rent focal seizures were probably suspected be- cause of the transient nature of the episodes. Initial MRI had shown a small abnormality in the right middle frontal gyrus, but this finding was not seen on follow-up imaging, which makes it unlikely to be related to the overall presentation. Baseline EEG had shown only brief left temporal slowing, without epileptiform ab- normalities. The EEG was an interictal study, so the findings do not rule out seizures. However, the slowing was ipsilateral to the abnormal movements, so it is unlikely to be related to the episodes. In addition, the patient\u2019s involuntary movements were nonstereotyped and nonrhyth- mic, which makes his presentation unlikely to  be due to a seizure disorder.\n\nFunctional Movement Disorder\nBecause this patient\u2019s movements diminished with the use of distraction techniques, a diag- nosis of functional movement disorder was considered. Most cases of functional movement disorder begin abruptly after a trigger, such as a mild physical injury or illness; a psychologi- cal stressor can be present but is not required for diagnosis. Symptoms are typically most se- vere around the time of onset and may wax and wane over time. Although distractibility is a finding associated with functional disorders, abnormal movements that occur with nonfunc- tional syndromes can sometimes be suppressed by action or incorporated into voluntary move- ments in a manner that may appear distract- ible. Several clinical features in this patient make a diagnosis of functional disorder unlikely. Func- tional movement disorder is more common in women than in men, and the average age at onset is 40 years.5 In addition, tremor is the most common clinical phenotype seen in patients with functional movement disorder; chorea or\n \n\nchoreoathetosis, which was seen in this patient, is very unusual in patients with functional movement disorder. Overall, functional move- ment disorder is unlikely to explain this pa- tient\u2019s presentation.\n\nDyskinesia\nPrimary paroxysmal dyskinesia refers to a group of heterogeneous syndromes characterized by recurrent involuntary movements that occur epi- sodically and abruptly, without loss of con- sciousness.6 These disorders usually begin in childhood or young adulthood. Both the age of this patient and the described phenomenology make a diagnosis of primary paroxysmal dyski- nesia unlikely.\nThe differential diagnosis in this case is there- fore focused on causes of secondary dyskinesia, of which there are many.7 MRI ruled out the presence of a mass lesion suggestive of cancer. The patient had no history of acute illness sug- gestive of a viral or other infectious encephalitis, and there was no history of trauma or exposure to drugs or other toxins. Although his daughter mentioned trouble with memory, there was no compelling history suggestive of a neurodegen- erative disease.\nA common metabolic cause of secondary dys- kinesia is diabetic striatopathy, a syndrome in- volving the acute-to-subacute onset of chorea and ballism in the context of hyperglycemia.8 This syndrome can occur as the initial manifes- tation of type 2 diabetes mellitus or as a compli- cation of poorly controlled diabetes. Diabetic striatopathy is more likely to develop in women than in men, and the average age at onset is 70 years. Most patients present with hemichorea and hemiballismus, rather than bilateral symp- toms. CT shows hyperdensity, and T1-weighted MRI shows hyperintensity, in the contralateral basal ganglia. However, this patient had no his- tory of diabetes and had a normal blood glycated hemoglobin level, features that rule out a diag- nosis of diabetic striatopathy.\nChoreiform movements can also be a mani-\nfestation of autoimmune conditions.9 This pa- tient\u2019s initial presentation with unilateral shoul- der and face movements would have suggested the possibility of faciobrachial dystonic seizures associated with anti\u2013leucine-rich, glioma-inacti- vated 1 (anti-LGI1) encephalitis.10  This condition is often associated with hyponatremia, which\nwas present in this patient. However, as the case evolved, leg involvement and sensory changes developed that would be atypical for anti-LGI1 encephalitis.\nOne key clue in this case is that the patient did not have an isolated movement disorder. In addition to motor symptoms, he had a variety of sensory symptoms involving both the left arm and the left leg. His first hospital admission was precipitated by an episode of unresponsiveness. The clinical event that led to his second presen- tation to the emergency department was dis- tinctly different: an acute onset of speech diffi- culty accompanied by left hemiparesis and right gaze deviation that was worrisome for an acute right middle cerebral artery (MCA) syndrome. The symptoms resolved without intervention, which indicates that he may have had an acute transient ischemic attack (TIA). The most rele- vant imaging finding was severe cerebrovascular disease, including severe stenosis of the distal right CCA and proximal right ICA. Could this patient\u2019s movement disorder be explained by a vascular lesion?\n\nLimb-Shaking TIAs\nLimb-shaking TIAs were first described by\nC. Miller Fisher in 1962.11 In most case reports, these episodes are associated with high-grade stenosis of the ICA, which was seen in this pa- tient.12,13 The mechanism is thought to be cere- bral hypoperfusion, and changes in posture or head position that decrease cerebral blood flow can precipitate these episodes. In this patient, the first episode of unresponsiveness that led to hospital admission occurred when he was sit- ting. He then had an acute episode involving right gaze preference that was provoked by exer- cise and was very suggestive of a TIA in the right MCA territory. These findings are highly sugges- tive of a diagnosis of limb-shaking TIAs, and I would refer this patient for emergency carotid endarterectomy.\n",
