    "Primary Symptom": "A 60-Year-Old Man with Fevers, Fatigue, Arthralgias, a Mouth Ulcer, and a Rash",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Zoe N. Memel (Medicine): A 60-year-old man presented to this hospital because of fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, a mouth ulcer, and a rash.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 1 month before the cur- rent presentation, when sore throat, fever, and fatigue developed while he was visiting relatives in the Southwest region of the United States. The symptoms persisted despite regular use of acetaminophen. Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of a local hospital in the Southwest, where a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- navirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reportedly negative. Oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline were prescribed, and the patient was discharged home.\nTen days before the current presentation, a tongue ulcer developed, along with dry scaly nodules on the face and hands and migratory arthralgias in the wrists, fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Because of worsening symptoms, the patient re- turned home to Boston by airplane. When he landed in Boston, the patient felt too weak to stand, and an ambulance was called to transport him to this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing fevers, fatigue, arthralgias, and sore throat. He had lost 4.5 kg over a 1-month period. He had no eye redness or pain, genital ulcers, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or headache. There was no notable medical history, and the patient had not been taking any regular medications before this illness. He had completed a course of oral amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid and doxycycline the day before presenta- tion, and he had been taking acetaminophen for the past month. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient was born in China and had immigrated to the United States 20 years earlier. He lived with his wife in Boston. He had not traveled internationally for more than 10 years. The patient had previously worked in environmental maintenance but was retired. He had no history of exposure to animals or fresh water and no sick contacts. He had not been sexually active for several years. He was a smoker with a 30-pack-year history, and he drank alcohol socially; there was no injection-drug use. His family history included colon cancer in his father, lung cancer in his mother, pancreatic cancer in his sister, and hepa- tocellular carcinoma in his brother.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 118/69 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 59 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 19.2. The patient appeared unwell. There was no conjunctival injection. Oral mucous membranes were dry. There was a circu- lar shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal aspect of the tongue. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly.  Strength  was  4/5  in  both shoulders. The remainder of the neurologic exami- nation was normal. There were several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers, an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow, and two erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead (Fig. 1). There were no genital lesions.\nTesting of a nasopharyngeal specimen for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative. The ferritin level was 3089 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 20 to 300) and the creatine kinase level 505 U per liter (reference range, 60 to 400). Urinalysis showed 2+ ketones and 1+ protein. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Karen Rodriguez: Chest radiography per- formed in the emergency department revealed bibasilar patchy opacities. Computed tomogra- phy (CT) of the chest, performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed dependent reticular opacities throughout the lower lobes of the lungs (Fig. 2). CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a left adrenal nodule, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter.\nDr. Memel: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Intravenous fluid and oral fluconazole were administered. Biopsies of skin lesions on the left elbow and left side of the forehead were performed. During the next 5 days, the fatigue, arthralgias, skin lesions, and mouth pain con- tinued, and daily fevers with temperatures of up to 38.8\u00b0C were recorded. The mouth lesion did not abate with the use of fluconazole, which was being administered for presumptive oral candi- diasis, and the agent was discontinued.\nDr. Samantha N. Champion: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the fore- head lesion revealed vacuolar interface derma- titis with hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, pigment incontinence, and sparse perivascular chronic inflammation. Similar findings were observed on histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen of the elbow lesion.\nDr. Memel: Cough developed, and pain in the left shoulder increased. On the fifth hospital day, the creatine kinase level was 906 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The next day, imaging studies of the left shoul- der were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder, performed on hospi- tal day 6, revealed patchy mild intramuscular edema that was most pronounced in the trape- zius and deltoid, a finding compatible with myo- sitis (Fig. 2). There was no focal or organized fluid collection.\nDr. Memel: On hospital day 10, biopsy of the left deltoid was performed with the patient under general anesthesia. In the 24 hours after the muscle biopsy, hypoxemia developed, and the patient received 3 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula to maintain an oxygen saturation of more than 93%. The next day, the patient received 8 liters of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging stud- ies of the chest were obtained.\nDr. Rodriguez: Repeat chest radiography re- vealed progressive patchy opacities at the lung bases. Repeat CT of the chest revealed progres- sive peribronchovascular and peripheral ground- glass and consolidative opacities predominantly involving the lower lobes, a finding consistent with organizing pneumonia (Fig. 2). In addition, new small left and trace right pleural effusions were present.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs.\nPanels A and B show several small scaly nodules with a rim of patchy erythema on the fingers. Panel C shows areas of hyperkeratosis on the lateral aspect of the fingers. Panel D shows an erosion with serosanguineous crust on the left elbow. Panel E shows two dull erythematous and mildly violaceous nodules on the forehead. Panel F shows a circular shallow ulcer on the lateral aspect of the tongue on the left side, as well as white plaque on the dorsal as\u2011 pect of the tongue.\n\nFigure 2 (facing page). Imaging Studies.\nCT was performed on hospital day 1. An axial image through the lower lungs (Panel A) shows dependent reticular and ground\u2011glass opacities. A coronal image through the mid\u2011lungs (Panel B) shows perilobular thickening and patchy ground\u2011glass opacities and sep\u2011 tal thickening without honeycombing or fibrosis. MRI was performed on hospital day 6. A T2\u2011weighted oblique image of the left shoulder (Panel C) shows patchy mild intramuscular edema that is most pronounced in the trapezius and deltoid. Repeat CT was performed on hos\u2011 pital day 11. An axial image through the mid\u2011lungs and lower lungs (Panel D) shows progressive peribroncho\u2011 vascular and peripheral ground\u2011glass and consolidative opacities, a finding compatible with organizing pneu\u2011 monia, as well as small left and trace right pleural effu\u2011 sions. Coronal and sagittal images (Panels E and F, re\u2011 spectively) show perilobular and septal thickening and consolidation.\n\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Zachary S. Wallace: This previously healthy 60-year-old man presented with a rapidly evolv- ing multisystem disease. Several aspects of his presentation \u2014 including fever, weight loss, pharyngitis, and inflammation (with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive pro- tein level, and ferritin level) \u2014 are common findings of infection, cancer, rheumatic disease, and other conditions. These findings are non- specific and do not help to narrow the differen- tial diagnosis. Migratory arthralgias are also nonspecific, especially in the absence of joint tenderness, swelling, and warmth, features that might indicate synovitis. The low titer of anti- nuclear antibodies (ANA) in a speckled pattern is a nonspecific test result that can be observed in healthy persons, as well as in patients with rheumatic disease, infection, cancer, or single- organ autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\nFour features of this patient\u2019s presentation\nhave specificity for certain diseases and thus may help to narrow the differential diagnosis. First, laboratory testing revealed the presence of anti-Ro antibodies. Second, the patient had fea- tures of myositis, including the inability to stand on his own, shoulder weakness on examination, evidence of muscle injury on laboratory testing (i.e., elevated aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase levels), and muscle edema on MRI. Third, he had several mucocutaneous manifestations of disease, including a tongue ulcer, as well as ulcerations and nodules on the face and hands. The white tongue plaque may also be a feature of his underlying disease. Al- though oral candidiasis was initially considered, the plaque did not abate with f luconazole ther- apy, and this lack of response would be atypical in a presumably immunocompetent host. Fourth, the patient had a rapidly evolving lung disease characterized by progressive hypoxemia.\nGiven these four features in particular, I\nwould consider a rheumatic disease in this pa- tient. However, when evaluating a patient for rheumatic disease, I also include infection, can- cer, and drug reactions in my initial differential diagnosis. These conditions often mimic rheu- matic disease, can be associated with the devel- opment of rheumatic disease (e.g., hepatitis B virus\u2013associated polyarteritis nodosa, cancer- associated dermatomyositis, and drug-induced lupus erythematosus), and may be exacerbated or made more difficult to diagnose after gluco- corticoids or other immunosuppressive medica- tions are administered.\n \nInfection\nIn this patient, the rapid onset of disease, his- tory of travel to the Southwest, fever, and cuta- neous nodules could be suggestive of an infec- tion such as coccidioidomycosis. However, an extensive evaluation for infectious diseases was negative.\n\nCancer\nLymphoma, leukemia, plasma-cell dyscrasias, and solid-organ cancers should be considered in this case because of the fever, weight loss, elevated alkaline phosphatase level, adrenal nodule, smok- ing history, and extensive family history of can- cer. However, the patient\u2019s blood counts were normal, he did not have lymphadenopathy, and key features of his presentation, especially the myositis and the pattern of lung disease, are not typical of cancer.\n\nDrug Reactions\nAlthough the patient had been exposed to sev- eral antimicrobial agents, his mucocutaneous lesions are not typical of a drug reaction. His illness began before any drug exposure, and lung disease and myositis would not be expected features of a drug reaction.\n\nRheumatic Diseases Associated with Anti-Ro Antibodies\nBecause infection, cancer, and drug reactions are unlikely diagnoses in this case, I will next consider how the development of anti-Ro anti- bodies, myositis, mucocutaneous lesions, and rapidly progressive lung disease may best fit with a diagnosis of rheumatic disease. The most common rheumatic diseases associated with anti-Ro antibodies are Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Less common diseases associated with anti-Ro antibodies are inflammatory myositis, mixed connective-tissue disease, and primary biliary cholangitis.\nCould Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome or lupus explain this patient\u2019s presentation? Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome typically affects women in their sixth decade and is characterized by an insidious onset of symptoms, including dry eyes and mouth.1 Extraglandular features may include nonspe- cific constitutional symptoms, pain, and neu- ropathy. The myositis, rapidly progressive lung disease, and mucocutaneous lesions observed in this patient would be atypical of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, especially in the absence of dry eyes and mouth.\nLike Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, lupus often has an insidious onset of symptoms and is more com- mon in women than in men, although the disease typically develops during the childbearing years.2 Mucocutaneous manifestations are com- mon, but the typical lesions observed in patients with lupus (e.g., acute or subacute cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus) are distinct, in terms of distribution and features, from the nodules and ulcerations described in this patient; he had a tongue ulcer, as opposed to the buccal mucosal ulcers often seen in patients with lupus. In addi- tion, other common features of lupus \u2014 includ- ing cytopenias, the presence of autoantibodies (e.g., antibodies directed against Smith antigen and double-stranded DNA), and hypocomple- mentemia \u2014 were absent in this case. Therefore, although lupus and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome are com- monly associated with anti-Ro antibodies, nei- ther disease is a good fit with this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nRheumatic  Diseases   Associated   with   Myositis In one approach to the evaluation of a patient with myositis, the first step is to characterize the distribution of muscle involvement as sym- metric or asymmetric. Pyomyositis and diabetic muscle infarction tend to have an asymmetric distribution, whereas rheumatic diseases tend to be associated with symmetric myositis. The exception is inclusion-body myositis, which tends to be asymmetric.\nIn patients with symmetric myositis, such as this patient, the next step in the evaluation is to characterize the distribution as primarily proxi- mal or distal. With rheumatic diseases, except for inclusion-body myositis, proximal rather than distal muscles tend to be involved. Endocrinopa- thies, such as hypothyroidism, can also cause symmetric proximal myopathy, but this patient had a normal thyrotropin level.\nOverall, the symmetric proximal myositis in this patient is consistent with idiopathic inflam- matory myopathy, which has been associated with anti-Ro antibodies.3 The classic categories of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are inclu- sion-body myositis, polymyositis, overlap syn- dromes (e.g., Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome and lupus), necrotizing myositis (e.g., statin-induced myo- sitis), antisynthetase syndrome, and dermato- myositis.\nInclusion-body myositis is an unlikely diag- nosis in this case because of the distribution of muscle involvement. Polymyositis is unlikely because of the mucocutaneous manifestations. Overlap syndromes are unlikely because of the absence of characteristic features of conditions such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, lupus, systemic sclerosis, and others. The patient had not been treated with statins and did not have features of necrotizing myositis on MRI. Patients with anti- synthetase syndrome typically have myositis along with other classic features, including Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, mechanic\u2019s hands (hyperkeratosis on the sides of the digits),4 inter- stitial lung disease, arthritis, and fever.5 This patient did not have Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon or inflammatory arthritis, and his ulcerative and nodular skin lesions would not be expected fea- tures of antisynthetase syndrome; the rapid progression of his lung disease would also be atypical.\nDermatomyositis\nCould this patient have dermatomyositis? Typical cutaneous manifestations of this disease include Gottron\u2019s papules (erythematous papules on the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalan- geal joints and other extensor surfaces), helio- trope rash (an erythematous-to-purplish rash that often involves the eyelids and surrounding area), V sign (also known as shawl sign, an ery- thematous rash on the front and back of the torso), and holster sign (an erythematous rash that involves the lateral hip area). This patient did not have these typical cutaneous manifesta- tions of dermatomyositis. However, dermato- myositis can be associated with interstitial lung disease, which was present in this patient. Al- though dermatomyositis remains a possible diagnosis in this case, I will consider other rheumatic diseases that could explain his pre- sentation.\nOther Rheumatic Diseases Associated with Myositis\nAdult-onset Still\u2019s disease, sarcoidosis, and vas- culitis can all be associated with myositis. How- ever, myositis, lung disease, and the presence of anti-Ro antibodies are not typical manifestations of adult-onset Still\u2019s disease, and the character- istic evanescent rash was absent in this patient.6 Sarcoidosis typically affects younger patients and classically causes hilar lymphadenopathy, which was absent in this patient.7 In addition, this patient\u2019s skin lesions and the presence of anti-Ro antibodies are not typical of sarcoidosis. Vasculitis is a broad category of diseases asso- ciated with inflammation of the walls of small, medium, and large vessels.8 Polyarteritis nodosa is a consideration in this patient because he had a history of hepatitis B, on the basis of the positive test for hepatitis B virus core antibodies. Patients with polyarteritis nodosa often have myalgias, but myositis is less common, and the lung disease observed in this patient would be\nan unusual feature of polyarteritis nodosa.\nImmune complex vasculitis, such as IgA or cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, is an unlikely di- agnosis in this case, given the normal C3 and C4 levels. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013associated vasculitis is also unlikely, given that an ANCA test was negative. Some patients with limited forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., disease limited to the head and neck) may have a negative ANCA test, but this patient did not have other, more typical features of the disease.9 Finally, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease can be associated with oral ulcers, but lung disease and the presence of anti-Ro antibodies are not con- sistent with this diagnosis.\nCan the results of the skin biopsies help to\nguide us toward the most likely diagnosis? The biopsy specimens did not show features sugges- tive of small- or medium-vessel vasculitis. There were no granulomas, which would be suggestive of sarcoidosis. There was evidence of interface dermatitis, which is typically associated with ei- ther lupus or dermatomyositis. Because lupus is unlikely to explain this patient\u2019s presentation, I will revisit dermatomyositis as a possible diagnosis.\n\nReconsidering Dermatomyositis\nAnother approach to the evaluation of this pa- tient with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is to consider the phenotypes of myositis associated with various myositis-specific antibodies.10 Some myositis-specific antibodies (anti\u2013transcrip- tional intermediary factor 1\u03b3 [anti\u2013TIF-1\u03b3] anti- bodies, anti\u2013Mi-2 antibodies, anti\u2013small ubiqui- tin-like modifier\u2013activating enzyme [anti-SAE] antibodies, and anti\u2013nuclear matrix protein 2 [anti\u2013NXP-2] antibodies) are associated with dermatomyositis with typical cutaneous mani- festations, but these manifestations were not present in this patient. Another type (anti\u2013histi- dyl\u2013transfer RNA synthetase [anti\u2013Jo-1] antibod- ies) is associated with antisynthetase syndrome, but the patient did not have the typical features of this condition, such as inflammatory arthritis or Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Additional myositis- specific antibodies (anti\u20133-hydroxy-3-methylglu- taryl\u2013coenzyme A reductase [anti\u2013HMG-CoA reductase] antibodies and anti\u2013signal recogni- tion particle [anti-SRP] antibodies) are associated with necrotizing myositis, which was also absent in this case.\nAnti\u2013melanoma differentiation\u2013associated pro-\ntein 5 (anti\u2013MDA-5) antibodies are associated with dermatomyositis with unique cutaneous features, especially skin ulcerations and nodular lesions, along with rapidly progressive intersti- tial lung disease and subtle myopathy; indeed, many cases of anti\u2013MDA-5 dermatomyositis are amyopathic. Cutaneous ulcerations overlying the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, elbows, and nail folds are seen in up to 85% of patients with anti\u2013MDA-5 dermatomyositis, often with lateral digital hyperkeratosis, which was observed in this patient.11,12 Approximately 50% of cases are associated with oral ulcers, often on the tongue. The arthralgias, fever, presence of anti-Ro antibodies, abnormal results on liver- function tests, and elevated ferritin level seen in this patient are common in patients with anti\u2013 MDA-5 dermatomyositis.\nI suspect that the most likely diagnosis in this patient is anti\u2013MDA-5 dermatomyositis. To establish this diagnosis, I would review the re- sults of the muscle biopsy and test for antibodies directed against myositis-associated autoantigens, including MDA-5.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Champion: The biopsy specimen from the left deltoid showed variation in the size and shape of muscle fibers, with scattered angulated and atrophic fibers. The atrophic fibers had a prefer- ential distribution in the perifascicular areas (Fig. 3). There was no evidence of inflammation, vasculitis, or necrotic or regenerating fibers. Im- munohistochemical staining of the biopsy spec- imen for inflammatory markers showed only sparse CD3-positive T cells and scattered CD68- positive perivascular macrophages. Immunohis- tochemical staining for complement (C5b-9) was negative for deposits in capillary walls. Electron microscopic examination revealed multiple en- dothelial cells that contained tubuloreticular inclusions.\nDespite the absence of inflammation and active injury to myocytes, the presence of perifas- cicular atrophy and endothelial inclusions in the muscle, in combination with the dermatopatho- logical findings, is consistent with the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.13 The absence of active disease could be due to sampling because inflam- mation can be patchy, or the disease could be in a quiescent phase.\nDr. Donald B. Bloch: An enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect myositis-associated autoantibodies. The patient\u2019s serum contained antibodies directed against MDA-5 and Ro-52 (Fig. 4). Both of these proteins have important roles in innate cellular immunity. MDA-5 is a cytoplasmic protein that is able to sense double-stranded viral RNA and subsequent- ly contributes to antiviral immunity by up-regu- lating interferon-stimulated genes.14 Ro-52 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to viruses that have been coated with antibodies and causes degradation of capsid proteins. Loss of the viral capsid proteins leads to the premature release of viral nucleic acids, which may then be sensed by proteins such as MDA-5.15 The potential roles of MDA-5 and Ro-52 in the pathogenesis of derma- tomyositis are unknown.\nA recent study showed the prevalence of false positive results associated with some commer- cially available assays that are used to detect myositis-associated autoantibodies.16 Therefore, indirect immunofluorescence and HEp-2 cell substrate were used to confirm the presence of autoantibodies against MDA-5 and Ro-52 in the patient\u2019s serum. HEp-2 cells do not express MDA-5 and express very low levels of Ro-52, which explains the low titer of ANA in this pa- tient. To increase the levels of these autoanti- gens in the HEp-2 cell substrate, HEp-2 cells were transiently transfected by plasmids encod- ing green f luorescent protein (GFP) fused to MDA-5 or Ro-52. The cells were subsequently fixed, permeabilized, and stained with the pa- tient\u2019s serum. Antibodies in the patient\u2019s serum stained only the cells that expressed GFP\u2013MDA-5 or GFP\u2013Ro-52 (Fig. 4). Taken together, the re- sults of the ELISA and the indirect immunofluo- rescence assay confirmed the presence of anti\u2013 MDA-5 and anti\u2013Ro-52 antibodies in this patient.\n\nFigure 3. Biopsy Specimen from the Left Deltoid.\nHematoxylin and eosin stains of sections of frozen tissue show skeletal muscle with perifascicular atrophy (Panel A, arrows) and varia\u2011 tion in the size and shape of muscle fibers, with scattered angulated and atrophic fibers (Panel B, asterisks). Immunohistochemical stains of sections of formalin\u2011fixed tissue show very few signs of chronic inflammation, including sparse CD3\u2011positive T cells (Panel C) and scattered CD68\u2011positive perivascular macrophages (Panel D). Electron microscopic images show endothelial cells with tubuloreticular inclusions (Panels E and F, asterisks).\n\nFigure 4. Test Results for Myositis-Associated Autoantibodies.\nPanel A shows the results of an enzyme\u2011linked immunosorbent assay used to detect myositis\u2011associated autoantibodies. The assay con\u2011 sists of a test strip with 16 purified autoantigens arrayed in parallel bands. The 17th band is a positive control (human immunoglobulin) for the colorimetric reaction. After incubation with diluted patient serum, antibodies that were adherent to the test strip were detected with the use of enzyme\u2011labeled anti\u2013human IgG antibody. The positive control serum contained antibodies directed against NXP\u20112. The patient serum contained antibodies that reacted with a band that was slightly higher than the NXP\u20112 band, which corresponded to the location of MDA\u20115. The patient serum also contained antibodies that reacted with Ro\u201152.\nPanels B through G show the results of an indirect immunofluorescence assay used to confirm the presence of anti\u2013MDA\u20115 and anti\u2013 Ro\u201152 antibodies in the patient serum. To increase the levels of these autoantigens in HEp\u20112 cell substrate, HEp\u20112 cells were transiently transfected by plasmids encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to MDA\u20115 (Panels B, C, and D) or Ro\u201152 (Panels E, F, and G). Monoclonal anti\u2011GFP antibody was used to identify successfully transfected cells (Panels B and E, in green). Antibodies in the patient serum stained only the cytoplasm of cells that expressed GFP\u2013MDA\u20115 or GFP\u2013Ro\u201152 proteins (Panels C and F, in red), a finding that con\u2011 firmed the presence of autoantibodies. The patient serum did not contain antibodies directed against GFP alone (not shown). Staining with 4\u2032,6\u2011diamidine\u20112\u2011phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) was used to show the location of nuclei (Panels D and G, in blue) in all cells, including those that did not express GFP\u2013MDA\u20115 or GFP\u2013Ro\u201152 proteins. The arrows indicate cells that expressed GFP fusion proteins.\n",
