    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Alexandra T. Lucas (Pediatrics): A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash.\nThe patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein left- overs from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were fol- lowed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart, tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. The lungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material dur- ing the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance. Blood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a com- plete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin.\nA urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approxi- mately 40 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were ad- ministered intravenously.\nDuring the next 30 minutes, tachypnea wors- ened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, and cyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask, resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then, oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute. Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vanco- mycin were given.\nDuring the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsa- lis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approxi- mately 110 minutes after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein and a continuous intravenous infusion of norepineph- rine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were ad- ministered, tracheal intubation was performed and mechanical ventilation with pressure-regu- lated volume control was begun, with a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, a rate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end- expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a frac- tion of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A con-\ntinuous infusion of propofol was begun.\nHypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpu- ric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patient\u2019s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillin\u2013tazobactam was administered, a 1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foley catheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenyleph- rine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was trans- ported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital. On the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital, additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not be- come progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermit- tent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly re- ceived all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smoked marijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic bever- ages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recre- ationally but did not use other illicit drugs.\nThe patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before ad- mission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. He worked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism, and his brother had had viral meningitis at  6 weeks of age.\nOn examination, the patient was pharmaco- logically sedated. The temperature was 40.8\u00b0C, the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2  of 50%. He opened his eyes occa-\nsionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to\nlight. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and ooz- ing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse re- ticular purpuric rash was present on the face, chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles (Fig. 1). A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiog- raphy revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions.\nDr. Manuella Lahoud-Rahme: A transthoracic echo-\ncardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vaso- pressin. The left ventricle had moderate dysfunc- tion with regional wall-motion abnormalities; septal motion was decreased, but apical motion appeared to be preserved. The right ventricle had mild-to-moderate dysfunction with underfilling. There was no pericardial effusion.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs.\nOn admission to this hospital, the patient had a rapidly evolving diffuse reticular purpuric rash on the face (not shown), chest and abdo- men (Panel A), arms (Panel B), and legs (Panel C).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Pavan K. Bendapudi: I was involved in the care of this patient and am aware of the diagnosis in this case. The patient presented with skin mot- tling and a rapidly progressive reticular rash that was most prominent in the acral regions. These findings occurred together with systemic inflam- matory response syndrome (SIRS), which includes fever, shock, severe lactic acidosis, and acute respiratory and renal failure. Perhaps the most striking features of this case were the profound coagulopathy and the rapid onset of illness, with the prodrome lasting less than 24 hours. Addi- tional considerations were his young age and the absence of risk factors typically associated with sepsis (e.g., a chronic illness or coexisting con- dition).\n\nSkin Necrosis\nCalciphylaxis and warfarin-induced skin necro- sis can both cause a reticular rash in the early stages of development. This patient was not re- ceiving warfarin. The lesions of calciphylaxis typically occur in regions of high adiposity (the lower abdomen, buttocks, or upper legs), are ex- tremely painful when touched, and progress over a period of days or weeks. In contrast, this pa- tient\u2019s skin findings occurred in an acral distribu- tion, were nontender, and progressed much more rapidly. Furthermore, calciphylaxis predominanly affects older patients and those with chronic renal failure, and calciphylaxis alone is not asso- ciated with systemic coagulopathy or SIRS.\n\nThrombocytopenic Purpura\nTwo forms of thrombocytopenic purpura can cause skin lesions and profound thrombocyto- penia: immune thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. These are distinct hematologic conditions, but for the pur- poses of this discussion, I will focus on their similarities. In both of these disorders, autoim- mune attack leads to thrombocytopenia. The presentation is almost always subacute. Skin find- ings tend to include easy bruising and a pete- chial rash, which is most commonly seen on the legs. Of note, neither disorder is associated with SIRS or coagulopathy, which are defining fea- tures of this case.\n\nCryoglobulinemic Vasculitis\nCryoglobulinemic vasculitis is a small-vessel vas- culitis that typically results in a patchy erythem- atous rash, as well as arthralgias, polyneuropa- thy, and fatigue. Unlike this patient, patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis often have an underlying disorder (most frequently hepatitis C), have a subacute course of illness, and do not have SIRS or coagulopathy.\nCatastrophic   Antiphospholipid    Syndrome \nDespite its name, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome typically evolves over a period of days or weeks \u2014 a much longer period than that observed in this case. This syndrome is associated with multiple discrete thrombotic episodes (e.g., deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke), rather than diffuse sys- temic microvascular thrombosis. Although the activated partial-thromboplastin time is often prolonged, generalized consumptive coagulopa- thy with hypofibrinogenemia does not typically occur. Furthermore, catastrophic antiphospho- lipid syndrome often occurs in the context of an underlying diagnosis of antiphospholipid syn- drome or another autoimmune disease. Patients with this syndrome do not present with shock; in fact, they can have severe hypertension due to renal involvement.\n\nInfectious Purpura Fulminans\nAcute infectious purpura fulminans is an ex- tremely thrombotic type of disseminated intra- vascular coagulation (Fig. 2A) that is most com-\n \nmonly associated with invasive infection with Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Capnocytophaga canimorsus. Purpura fulminans re- sults from uncontrolled systemic thrombosis trig- gered by a maladaptive inflammatory response in the host, leading to the triad of severe consump- tive coagulopathy, SIRS, and purpuric rash. The onset of illness is extremely rapid, with a reticu- lar rash and skin mottling often occurring in the early stages and life-threatening SIRS and coagu- lopathy usually developing within 24 hours or less. These features are all consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation.\nIn addition, the diagnosis of purpura fulminans is consistent with several laboratory abnor- malities observed in this patient. The substan- tially elevated lactic acid level at presentation is suggestive of severe SIRS and shock. The mark- edly prolonged prothrombin-time international normalized ratio and activated partial-thrombo- plastin time, severe thrombocytopenia, and un- detectable plasma fibrinogen level are all features of profound consumptive coagulopathy. Patients with purpura fulminans typically have a low or pseudonormal fibrinogen level in the presence of overwhelming inflammatory stimuli. In some patients, profound hypofibrinogenemia results in decoupling of the C-reactive protein level and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, with an iso- lated increase in the C-reactive protein level and a disproportionately low erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate \u2014 a finding that was also seen in this patient. Furthermore, low levels of the endog- enous anticoagulants proteins C and S and anti- thrombin are features of purpura fulminans that were seen in this patient.\nTaken together, the features of this patient\u2019s presentation were most consistent with severe acute infectious purpura fulminans. Given his age and the reported presence of neck stiffness and neurologic findings, we suspected that the\ntrigger was meningococcal disease.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Julian A. Villalba: Blood cultures had been ob- tained at the other hospital before the adminis- tration of antimicrobial therapy. After approxi- mately 11 hours of incubation, microbial growth was detected in the aerobic blood-culture bottle. A Gram\u2019s stain of the blood-culture broth re- vealed uniform gram-negative diplococci. On the basis of this finding, the broth was subcultured on blood and chocolate agar plates. After over- night incubation on solid media, small, gray, glistening nonhemolytic colonies were detected. Phenotypic testing revealed oxidase and catalase activity, as well as a failure to split indole from the tryptophan molecule after the addition of spot indole reagent; these findings are suggestive of but not specific for neisseria species. A rapid biochemical test panel that combined carbohy- drate fermentation tests and direct enzyme detection assays was performed. After a 4-hour incubation period, the isolate was identified as\nN.\tmeningitidis.\nAn isolate of the organism was sent to the state laboratory for confirmation, susceptibility testing, and serogrouping. Serogrouping by means of slide agglutination with a set of antisera against common serogroups identified the iso- late as N. meningitidis serogroup C. A Cefinase disk test was negative for beta-lactamase. Anti- microbial susceptibility testing was performed with the use of the Epsilometer test and broth microdilution methods. The minimum inhibitory concentration was 0.002 \u03bcg per milliliter for ceftriaxone, indicating that the organism was susceptible to the therapy that the patient was receiving. Additional blood cultures that had been obtained after the patient was transferred to this hospital were negative.\n",
