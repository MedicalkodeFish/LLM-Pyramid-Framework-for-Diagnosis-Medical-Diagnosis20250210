    "Primary Symptom": "A 61-Year-Old Man with Eyelid Swelling",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jonathan E. Lu (Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 61-year-old man was evaluated in an ophthalmology clinic affiliated with this hospital  because  of eyelid swelling.\nEight years before the current presentation, the patient noticed mild puffiness of the eyelids that was worst in the morning and typically resolved by midday. Five years before the current presentation, the eyelid swelling began to progressively worsen and to last throughout the day. The patient had a history of glaucoma; when the eyelid swelling began to interfere with his vision, he asked for a consul- tation with the ophthalmologist who had treated his glaucoma. A diagnosis of dermatochalasis with fat prolapse was suspected, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery clinic affiliated with this hospi- tal for consideration of blepharoplasty.\nIn the clinic, the patient reported that eyelid puffiness was interfering with his ability to read and drive. He did not have dry eye. He had a sensation of pressure behind the eyes and intermittent double vision. There was generalized joint stiff- ness in the mornings that resolved after 1 hour. There was left lateral hip pain that radiated to the left buttock and thigh, with associated paresthesia in the left foot. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had been diagnosed 31 years before the current presentation and was well controlled with antiretroviral therapy, although lipodystrophy had occurred with treatment. Other medical history in- cluded carpal tunnel syndrome, cataracts, depression, dyslipidemia, hypertension, allergic rhinitis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, in addition to primary open- angle glaucoma. Surgical history included carpal tunnel release surgery (per- formed 2 months before the current presentation), intraocular lens replacement in both eyes, and lipectomy for the reduction of dorsocervical lipohypertrophy due to lipodystrophy. Medications included antiretroviral therapy (elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide), bupropion, f luoxetine, triamterene, amlodipine, atorvastatin, inhaled albuterol, and topical testosterone. The admin- istration of iodinated contrast material had caused hives. The patient lived part time in Florida and part time in New England. He was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol oc- casionally, and did not use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the corrected visual acuity was 20/25 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. Confrontation testing revealed deficits in the outer superior temporal visual fields and the superior nasal visual fields, which abated with manual elevation of the eyelids. Supraduction and abduction were limited in both eyes. Soft edema of the upper and lower eyelids was pres- ent, along with mild erythema of the upper eye- lids (Fig. 1). The upper-eyelid skin was over- hanging the lashes medially, a finding indicative of dermatochalasis. There was upper-eyelid ptosis. The globes were moderately resistant to retro- pulsion, and there was mild proptosis. The leva- tor palpebrae superioris muscles had impaired function, with an eyelid elevation of 8 mm in the right eye and 11 mm in the left eye (reference\n \nrange, 12 to 18). Slit-lamp examination revealed 1+ chemosis and trace injection in the conjunc- tivae; there was no evidence of superficial punc- tate keratopathy or cells in the anterior cham- bers. Funduscopic examination revealed an increased cup-to-disk ratio in the optic nerves, a finding consistent with the patient\u2019s known his- tory of glaucoma. The tongue was enlarged, and there was dorsocervical lipohypertrophy on the posterior aspect of the neck.\nThe blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyrox- ine, triiodothyronine, thyroid peroxidase anti- bodies, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobu- lins were normal. Imaging studies were obtained. Dr. Laura V. Romo: Computed tomography (CT)\nof the face and orbits (Fig. 2A and 2B), per- formed without the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed bilateral en- largement of the extraocular muscles and fat stranding in the orbits and elsewhere in the face. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the face and orbits (Fig. 2C through 2F), performed before and after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed orbital fat stranding and mild, symmetric, diffuse extraocular- muscle enlargement. A short-tau inversion recovery sequence showed an increased signal that spared the myotendinous junctions. Diffuse thickening and stranding of the skin on the preseptal eye- lids and face, episcleritis along the posterior margin of both globes, and perineuritis around the optic nerves were also noted.\nDr. Lu: The blood levels of glucose and electrolytes and the results of kidney-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 22 mm per hour (refer- ence range, 0 to 20). The blood IgG level was 1980 mg per deciliter (reference range, 767 to 1590), the IgG1 level 283 mg per deciliter (refer- ence range, 341 to 894), and the IgG2 level 1750 mg per deciliter (reference range, 171  to 632); the blood IgG3 and IgG4 levels were normal. Indirect immunofluorescence testing for anti- neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was negative, including an enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assay for antibodies to proteinase 3 and myeloperoxidase. A rapid plasma reagin test was nonreactive. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection was negative.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs at Presentation.\nPhotographs of the eyes were obtained in several gaze positions. In primary gaze, the patient has edema and mild erythema of the upper eyelids, along with festoons of the lower eyelids (Panel A). The upper\u2011eyelid edema is more pronounced when viewed from below (Panel B). There is mild limitation of extraocular motility in all gaze positions, including up gaze (Panel C), right gaze (Panel D), left gaze (Panel E), and down gaze (Panel F).\n\nFigure 2 (facing page). Imaging Studies of the Face and Orbits.\nCT of the face and orbits was performed. A coronal im\u2011 age (Panel A) shows abnormal, curvilinear stranding in otherwise normal, low\u2011attenuation orbital fat (red arrow). Mild, diffuse enlargement of the extraocular muscles, including the superior and medial rectus muscles in both eyes, is also present (asterisks). An axial image (Panel B) shows abnormal, curvilinear stranding in other\u2011 wise normal, low\u2011attenuation orbital fat (red arrow); preseptal soft\u2011tissue thickening along the anterior mar\u2011 gin of both globes (blue arrow); and fat stranding along both temples (yellow arrow). MRI of the face and orbits was also performed. A coronal T1\u2011weighted image (Panel C) shows abnormal stranding (gray) in normal orbital fat (white), which has high signal intensity (red arrow). A coronal short\u2011tau inversion recovery image (Panel D) shows abnormal stranding (white), which has high signal intensity that spares the myotendinous junctions, in normal orbital fat (gray), where the signal is suppressed (red arrow). Diffuse enlargement of the extraocular muscles, including the superior and medial rectus muscles, is also present and has high signal inten\u2011 sity (asterisks). An axial T1\u2011weighted, contrast\u2011enhanced, fat\u2011saturated image (Panel E) shows abnormal strand\u2011 ing and enhancement in the retrobulbar and episcleral\nfat (red arrows), diffuse thickening and enhancement of the preseptal soft tissue (blue arrow), and enhancement along the optic\u2011nerve sheaths (yellow arrows), a finding consistent with perineuritis. An axial T2\u2011weighted image (Panel F) shows diffuse preseptal soft\u2011tissue thickening with low signal intensity along the anterior margin of both globes (red arrow).\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Natalie Wolkow: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagno- sis. I evaluated this patient for upper-eyelid blepharoplasty for the treatment of dermatocha- lasis (excess upper-eyelid skin); however, the clinical examination findings were atypical, prompting further investigation. He had derma- tochalasis, but the skin was  puffy,  edematous,  and mildly erythematous. He also had lower-  eyelid edema (festoons) and mild conjunctival chemosis and injection, findings suggestive of inflammation. These features, in  combination with upper-eyelid ptosis, mild limitation of ex- traocular motility in several gaze positions, im- pairment of levator-muscle function, and moder- ate resistance to retropulsion when pressing over the eyes, were suggestive of a chronic orbital inflammatory process.\n\nThyroid Eye Disease\nThe most common cause of orbital inflamma- tion is thyroid eye disease. The patient\u2019s eyelid edema and erythema, orbital resistance to retro- pulsion, limited extraocular motility, impaired levator-muscle function, and conjunctival che- mosis and injection were consistent with thyroid eye disease. There was no eyelid retraction, lag, or flare, which are typical findings of  thyroid eye disease. Instead, there was eyelid ptosis. Patients with thyroid eye disease occasionally present with ptosis, but it is uncommon.1 The patient had no history of systemic thyroid dis- ease, but more than 20% of patients present with thyroid eye disease before systemic disease is diagnosed.2\nIt is notable that the patient\u2019s clinical course was atypical for thyroid eye disease. Most pa- tients with thyroid eye disease have progression of inflammation for 1 to 2 years followed by improvement, whereas this patient had slow progression for many years. In addition, the re- sults of tests for thyroid function and thyroid antibodies were normal in this case. On review of the patient\u2019s imaging studies, the bilateral extraocular-muscle enlargement with fusiform features was typical of thyroid eye disease. How- ever, the uniform pattern of extraocular-muscle enlargement and the presence of episcleritis, perineuritis, orbital fat stranding, and skin thickening were atypical and prompted consid- eration of alternative causes of orbital inflam- mation.\n\nCancer\nMetastatic cancer, lymphomatous or leukemic infiltration, or paraneoplastic disease can cause extraocular-muscle enlargement, at times with an inflammatory clinical appearance.3-6 Patients with these diseases may present with unilateral or bilateral limitation of extraocular motility, conjunctival chemosis and injection, resistance to retropulsion, or eyelid edema. Metastatic lesions that affect the extraocular muscles typically manifest as nodular or focal enlargement;  in rare cases, lymphoma or leukemia manifests as bilateral, diffuse extraocular-muscle involvement. He had no history of cancer, but extraocular- muscle enlargement can be the presenting sign of cancer.\nHowever, this patient\u2019s clinical course was atypical for cancer or paraneoplastic disease. Metastatic cancer or lymphomatous or leukemic infiltration of the extraocular muscles would progress over a period of weeks to months, and when diffuse bilateral disease is present, there can be rapid symptom progression and vision loss.4 By contrast, this patient had an 8-year his- tory of progressive symptoms without the devel- opment of systemic signs of cancer.\n\nChronic   Inflammatory   Orbital    Myositis Several systemic inflammatory diseases can manifest with orbital inflammation, including extraocular-muscle enlargement due to chronic orbital myositis. Sarcoidosis can cause bilateral extraocular-muscle enlargement, but in such cases, it would usually also cause lacrimal gland enlargement or orbital masses.7,8 The extraocular- muscle enlargement can progress slowly, at\ntimes with no pain. In this patient, the normal ACE and lysozyme levels and the absence of lac- rimal gland enlargement and orbital masses make sarcoidosis an unlikely diagnosis.\nIgG4-related disease is another inflammatory process that can have orbital involvement with slow progression and minimal pain. Orbital IgG4-related disease most often results in lacri-\n \nmal gland enlargement and tends to cause enlargement of trigeminal nerve branches, par- ticularly the infraorbital nerve, but extraocular- muscle enlargement can also occur.9 Although a normal IgG4 level alone would not rule out IgG4-related disease, the combination of the nor- mal IgG4 level and the absence of lacrimal gland and infraorbital nerve enlargement lowers the likelihood of IgG4-related disease in this case.\nOrbital granulomatosis with polyangiitis usu- ally causes lacrimal gland enlargement or orbital masses, but isolated extraocular-muscle enlarge- ment can occur occasionally.10 In  this  patient, the negative ANCA testing, the absence of lacri- mal gland enlargement and orbital masses, and the absence of symptoms and imaging findings of sinus disease make extraocular-muscle en- largement due to granulomatosis with polyangi- itis unlikely.\n\nMedication-Induced Orbital Myositis Medications such as bisphosphonates11,12 and im- mune checkpoint inhibitors13 can cause orbital myositis, although it is typically acute and pain- ful. None of this patient\u2019s medications have known associations with orbital inflammation. The initiation of antiretroviral therapy in pa- tients with HIV infection has been associated with immune reconstitution inflammatory syn-\ndrome (IRIS). Cases of orbital myositis due to delayed-onset IRIS that developed 1 and 3 years after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy have been described,14,15 but patients with this condi- tion usually present with acute eye pain, ery- thema, and edema. IRIS is unlikely in this pa- tient, given the absence of acute symptoms and the long-standing use of antiretroviral therapy.\n\nHIV-Related Lipodystrophy\nLipodystrophy can manifest as lipoatrophy, lipo- hypertrophy, or both.16 The mechanisms of lipo- dystrophy are not fully understood, but inflam- matory responses to HIV infection and effects of antiretroviral therapy in adipose tissue are thought to lead to these changes.16 Certain anti- retroviral therapies are associated with lipohy- pertrophy and others with lipoatrophy. This pa- tient had a history of marked dorsocervical lipohypertrophy, for which he had undergone lipectomy. At the time of the current presenta- tion, abnormal reticulation and thickening in  the subcutaneous tissue of the face and neck and in the orbital fat were observed on CT and MRI. I considered whether these changes were consis- tent with HIV-related lipohypertrophy. The face is not typically a site of lipohypertrophy. Orbital lipoatrophy has been reported,17,18 but orbital lipo- hypertrophy has not.\nOverall, none of the diagnoses that I initially considered fit well with this patient\u2019s presenta- tion. His systemic symptoms were revisited, and he was referred to the rheumatology clinic af- filiated with this hospital for evaluation of joint stiffness, hip pain, and foot paresthesia. Before his evaluation in the rheumatology clinic,  he was evaluated for new dyspnea on exertion and received a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. Given the presence of new cardiomyopathy, paresthesia, and carpal tunnel syndrome, amyloidosis was added to the differential diagnosis.\n\nAmyloidosis\nAmyloidosis can involve any tissue of the ocular adnexa, but such involvement is very uncommon. Patients usually present to ophthalmologists with localized disease, most often with unilat- eral eyelid ptosis or an eyelid mass.19 Less than 10% of patients with ocular adnexal amyloidosis have systemic amyloidosis, with involvement of other organs.20,21\nAlthough amyloidosis can in rare cases cause extraocular-muscle enlargement, ocular adnexal amyloidosis is not typically considered to be an inflammatory process. This patient\u2019s ocular find- ings were suggestive of inflammation, so I had not  initially considered the diagnosis. Some patients with amyloidosis affecting the extraocular muscles can present with eyelid edema,22 and when there is extensive amyloid deposition in the ocular adnexa, the eyelids can take on an inflammatory appearance, with festoons and red discoloration of the skin, findings that were seen in this case.20\nThe bilateral extraocular-muscle enlargement, the subcutaneous and orbital fat stranding, and the inflammatory appearance of the eyelids in this patient could be explained by amyloid depo- sition in the extraocular muscles, orbital fat, and skin, respectively. In addition, the glaucoma could possibly be the result of amyloid deposi- tion in the arterial circle of Zinn\u2013Haller, which supplies the optic-nerve head. The conjunctival chemosis and injection, as well as the episcleritis and perineuritis seen on MRI, could be the result of amyloid deposition in the optic-nerve sheath (dura), sclera, and episclera.23\nOnly 2 to 16% of patients with ocular adnexal amyloidosis have extraocular-muscle involve- ment.20,21 Among such patients, those with bilat- eral, diffuse extraocular-muscle enlargement are more likely to have systemic amyloidosis than those with unilateral extraocular-muscle enlarge- ment.22 This patient had bilateral orbital disease, no discrete orbital or eyelid masses, and no vis- ible amyloid deposits on eyelid eversion, features that made unilateral localized amyloidosis un- likely (although it is more common than sys- temic disease) and thus were suggestive of sys- temic amyloidosis. His slow disease progression, history of carpal tunnel syndrome, and new car- diomyopathy were also consistent with systemic amyloidosis.\nSystemic amyloidosis was the leading diagno- sis for this patient. To establish the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis, amyloid must be detected in tissue, so biopsy of affected ophthalmic tissue was indicated. Because biopsy of extraocular muscle requires general anesthesia and carries a risk of permanent diplopia, biopsy of eyelid skin and orbital fat was performed with the patient under local anesthesia.\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Systemic amyloidosis.",
    "Diagnosis": "Systemic immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis.",
    "Key testing": "Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimen from the left upper eyelid",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Anna M. Stagner: Hematoxylin and eosin stain- ing of the biopsy specimen from the left upper eyelid (Fig. 3A) showed a paucity of inflamma- tion. Vessel walls within the dermis, subcutis, and superficial skeletal muscle (orbicularis oculi) were markedly thickened and were expanded by faintly eosinophilic material. At higher magnifi- cation (Fig. 3B), the material was acellular and had a pale-pink, amorphous, homogenized ap- pearance. On Congo red staining (Fig. 3C), the faintly eosinophilic material was highlighted in bright magenta and was associated with apple- green birefringence when viewed under cross- polarized light. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry showed a peptide pattern consistent with lambda immunoglobulin light-chain amyloid.\nAfter the diagnosis of amyloidosis was established, a bone marrow biopsy (Fig. 3D) revealed evidence of a plasma-cell neoplasm, with an in- creased number of mature plasma cells (ac- counting for 15 to 20% of the marrow cellu- larity) in a background of normal maturing trilineage hematopoiesis. The plasma cells were highlighted on immunostaining for CD138 (Fig. 3E) and showed lambda light-chain restric- tion on immunostaining for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains (Fig. 3F).\n",
