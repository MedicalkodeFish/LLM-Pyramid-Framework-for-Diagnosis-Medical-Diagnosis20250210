    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jacob M. Rosenberg: A 53-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressive headache, gait instability, and weight loss.\nApproximately 2 months before the patient\u2019s evaluation at this hospital, vertigo developed and resolved spontaneously. One day before evaluation at this hospital, she sought care at another hospital for recurrent dizziness and difficulty walking. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 86 beats per minute, the blood pressure 170/105 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 97% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented, with slow speech, bilateral end-point horizontal nystagmus, and mild dysmetria on the right side on finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing. Strength and sensory function were normal. She had difficulty maintaining a stable stance; her gait was narrow- based and described as \u201cslow and cautious.\u201d The remainder of the examination was normal.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed an area of ill-defined hypoattenuation that was consistent with vasogenic edema in the right cerebellar hemisphere, as well as regions of white-matter hypoattenuation in both cerebellar hemispheres. Aspirin and atorvastatin were administered.\nDr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an enhancing intraaxial lesion, measuring 2.0 cm by 1.8 cm by 1.7 cm, in the right inferior cerebellar hemisphere. The lesion had internal signal hypo- intensity that was indicative of necrosis on T1-weighted imaging, as well as sur- rounding signal hyperintensity that was suggestive of vasogenic edema on T2- weighted imaging. There was local mass effect with effacement of the overlying cerebellar fissures and the fourth ventricle. There was also an enhancing leptomeningeal lesion, measuring 4 mm in diameter, along the left medial frontal lobe in the left su- perior frontal gyrus, with possible leptomenin- geal extension. The lesion was characterized by internal and surrounding signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging.\nDr. Rosenberg: Intravenous dexamethasone, am- lodipine, and labetalol were administered. The patient was transferred to this hospital for spe- cialized neurosurgical consultation.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, review of sys- tems was notable for malaise and lethargy, as well as unintentional weight loss of 15 kg during the past year. The patient also reported an in- crease in urinary frequency without hematuria, dysuria, or flank pain. She had no fever, chills, sinus pain, dyspnea, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. She had a history of hypertension and hemorrhagic stroke, which had led to a craniotomy on the right side for evacuation of a \u201cblood clot\u201d 13 years before the current evaluation, with no reported neurologic deficits.\nThe patient reported that, during the admission for craniotomy, she was told that she had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and was treated with an unknown antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen; she could not recall the medications included in the regimen. In addition, she reported that, several years later, further testing revealed that an error had been made and she did not have HIV infection. She reported that ART medications were discontin- ued at least 3 years before the current evaluation. \nThe patient did not have a history of opportunistic infections or cancer. Three years earlier, a Mantoux tuberculin skin test had been negative. One week earlier, a mammogram had been nor- mal. She had never undergone a colonoscopy ora Papanicolaou test.\nThe patient was born in Ivory Coast, West Africa, and had been living in the United States for more than 20 years. She reported no recent travel. She lived with her children and did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She was divorced and not sexually active; in her lifetime, she had had one male sexual partner. Her ex-husband and one of her children reportedly had tested negative for HIV. Her fa- ther had had a myocardial infarction in his 60s; her mother and sisters were healthy. The patient had not been taking any medications at home before this illness and had no known allergies to medications.\nOn physical examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 165/99 mm Hg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) 22.5. The patient was comfortable, alert, and oriented. Her speech was clear, with intact naming and repetition. Her pupils were equal and reactive to light, extraocular movements were intact, and visual fields were full in re- sponse to confrontation. She had mild right esotropia and no nystagmus. Her face was sym- metric, but there was mild deviation of the tongue to the left. Results of other cranial-nerve testing were normal. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed subtle dysmetria that was greater on the right side than on the left side; there was no dysdiadochokinesia or intention tremor. Her stance was approximately shoulder-width. Her balance was impaired, and her gait was unsteady and ataxic. Psychomotor slowing was present, and the Romberg sign was absent. An evaluation of power, bulk, tone, sensation, and deep-tendon reflexes was normal. She had alopecia and oral thrush. The remainder of the examination was normal. The patient was admitted to the hospi- tal for further evaluation and treatment.\nResults of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, vitamin B12, and glycated hemoglo- bin. An HIV screening test for the detection of antibodies to HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) and HIV-1 p24 antigen was reactive. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was not detected. The CD4+ T-cell count was 39 per microliter (reference range, 348 to 1456). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A urine sample was ob- tained for culture. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a mildly enlarged and multi- nodular left thyroid gland, as well as scattered pulmonary nodules measuring less than 4 mm in diameter. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hypoattenuating hepatic lesion measuring 1.1 cm in the greatest dimension that was consistent with hemangioma, as well as diffuse lytic osseous lesions in the thoracolumbar spine and pelvis.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Geoffrey S. Gottlieb: This 53-year-old woman, originally from West Africa, presented with sub- acute, progressive focal neurologic symptoms, cerebellar signs, and an MRI of the head show- ing two contrast-enhancing lesions. She reported that, 13 years before the current admission, she received a diagnosis of HIV and was treated with an unknown ART regimen, and then several years later, testing revealed an error and ART was discontinued. On the current admission, a screening assay for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 and HIV-1 p24 antigen was reactive, and the CD4+ T-cell count was quite low at 39 per micro- liter; however, the plasma HIV-1 RNA level was undetectable. The first step in developing a dif- ferential diagnosis in this case is to interpret the confusing HIV test results and to determine whether the patient has HIV infection (Table 2).1\nHIV Test Results\nSeveral clinical scenarios could yield the pattern of HIV test results seen in this case. The most common scenario is that the HIV antigen\u2013anti- body screening test had a false positive result. Although false positive results were more com- mon with earlier versions of HIV antibody tests, current HIV antigen\u2013antibody screening tests have a high specificity, with a false positive rate of no more than 40 per 10,000 tests, which makes a false diagnosis of HIV infection possi- ble but unlikely. Furthermore, the patient\u2019s low CD4+ T-cell count would need to be explained. She could have a false positive HIV screening test and idiopathic CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia, a rare entity with an unclear cause, but this would be an unusual and unlikely combination of clinical events.\nIt is possible that the patient has HIV-1 infec-\ntion but is an \u201celite controller,\u201d a person who has natural control of HIV infection without ART but with slow clinical progression. This possibility would explain the positive HIV screen- ing test and the undetectable HIV-1 RNA level. However, elite controller status is rare, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 500 to 1000\n \n\npersons with HIV-1 infection. Nonetheless, slow, decades-long disease progression has been ob- served in some elite controllers. This patient is 53 years old, so if she had become infected with HIV-1 in the 1980s, the infection could have progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syn- drome (AIDS) by now.\nIt is also possible that this patient is infected with a rare HIV-1 group (N, O, or P), HIV-1 group M subtype, or circulating recombinant form that is not detected by current HIV-1 viral load tests. These strains are exceedingly rare but are known to be circulating in West and Central Africa, and this patient was originally from Ivory Coast.\nOther potential explanations include surrepti- tious use of ART due to either stigma or neuro- psychiatric issues. A preanalytical error, such as a mix-up of the blood sample for confirmatory testing or HIV-1 viral load testing, could have occurred. Finally, the patient could have infec- tion with HIV-2, which is prevalent in West Af- rica and accounted for the majority of HIV cases in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe diagnosis of HIV that the patient had received 13 years before this admission might have been correct. The details of previous testing and ART are not available currently but should be investigated. On the basis of the features of this patient\u2019s presentation, her positive HIV screening test in the context of an undetectable HIV-1 RNA level, and her country of origin, I suspect she has HIV-2 infection. Given the low CD4+ T-cell count, the presentation is consistent with HIV-2\u2013associated AIDS.\nEstablishing the  Diagnosis  of  HIV-2   Infection In this patient, I would recommend performing supplemental testing with an HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines,1 as well as an HIV-2 viral load test to obtain the plasma HIV-2 RNA level. If these tests return negative, I would consider sending a\nwhole-blood sample for nucleic acid testing for HIV-2 DNA and RNA. In the areas of West Af- rica in which HIV-2 is endemic, approximately one third of HIV-2\u2013infected persons are coin- fected with HIV-12; in this patient, the undetect- able plasma HIV-1 RNA level essentially rules out HIV-1 coinfection.\nNeurologic Symptoms  and  Imaging   Findings The next step in this case is to consider the pa- tient\u2019s neurologic symptoms and imaging find- ings in the context of a likely diagnosis of HIV-2\u2013 associated AIDS. The differential diagnosis for brain lesions in people with HIV and AIDS is quite broad.3 Brain lesions may be mass or non- mass lesions, and they may or may not have\ncontrast enhancement. Mass lesions of the brain may be caused by Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis (cerebral toxoplasmosis); tuberculosis with cen- tral nervous system (CNS) involvement (tuber- culoma); primary CNS lymphoma, which is as- sociated with Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection; Cryptococcus neoformans infection with CNS involve- ment (cryptococcoma); brain abscess due to bac- terial or fungal infection; neurocysticercosis; or Treponema pallidum infection (syphilitic gumma). Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, due to JC virus and HIV encephalopathy, does not typically cause mass lesions. Cytomegalovirus encephalitis typically occurs without mass lesions and rarely causes mass effect. Of course, meta- static cancer to the brain and conditions unre- lated to HIV and AIDS that affect the brain can lead to neurologic symptoms and imaging find- ings similar to those seen in this case.\nAmong all these possibilities, my leading diag-\nnoses in this case are T. gondii encephalitis, tuber- culoma, and primary CNS lymphoma. Several epi- demiologic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of this case favor the diagnosis of T. gondii encephalitis. First, toxoplasmosis is the most com- mon CNS infection among patients with AIDS who are not receiving prophylaxis, and this patient was not receiving trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole. Historically, the 12-month incidence of T. gondii encephalitis among patients with AIDS who are not receiving prophylaxis has been approximately 33%. Second, this patient could have had exposure to toxoplasma in Ivory Coast, where the seroprevalence is 60 to 70%. Third, her CD4+ T-cell count is less than 100 per microliter, the level below which T. gondii encephalitis typically occurs, and this finding places her at high risk for the infection. Finally, her MRI lesions have contrast enhancement, as well as signal hypointensity indicative of necrosis on T1-weighted imaging. She has at least two CNS lesions with mass ef- fect, and one is ring-enhancing. These features are all consistent with T. gondii encephalitis.\nHowever, several features of this patient\u2019s case do not fit with the diagnosis of T. gondii encephalitis. She has had relatively slow clinical progression and has not reported a fever. T. gondii encephalitis with cerebellar involvement is not common. She has scattered pulmonary nodules (measuring <4 mm) of an unknown cause; this finding would not typically be seen in reactiva- tion of T. gondii encephalitis but could be due to an unrelated condition. Her history of a cerebro- vascular accident 13 years earlier could be relat- ed to her current illness, but given the time frame, I think a connection is unlikely.\nEstablishing the Diagnosis of T. gondii\nEncephalitis\nTo determine whether this patient has T. gondii encephalitis, I would perform serologic testing for IgM and IgG against toxoplasma. I would also start empirical treatment, perform ongoing clinical assessments, and perform repeat MRI of the head in 10 to 14 days. If she does not have evidence of improvement at that time, then I would pursue a brain biopsy, which is the stan- dard approach for the diagnosis of brain lesions. Because mass effect is present on imaging in this patient, a lumbar puncture is probably not safe. However, if it were safe to obtain cerebro- spinal fluid, then I would obtain a specimen for\nT. gondii nucleic acid testing, which has a speci-\nficity of 96 to 100% and a sensitivity of 50%.\n",
