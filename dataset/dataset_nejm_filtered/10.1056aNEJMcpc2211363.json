    "Primary Symptom": "A 31-Year-Old Woman with Postpartum Abdominal Pain and Fever",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Megan E. Bunnell (Obstetrics and Gynecology): A 31-year-old woman was admit- ted to this hospital 15 days after the birth of her  first child because of abdominal   pain and fever.\nThe patient had received routine prenatal care at this hospital. Serologic screen- ing during the pregnancy showed immunity to rubella. Rectovaginal culture was positive for group B streptococcus. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodeficiency virus were negative.\nSixteen days before this admission, the patient went into labor at 38 weeks 1 day of gestation. She was admitted to this hospital. The white-cell count was 13,800 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the hemoglobin level was 14.0 g per deciliter (reference range, 12.0 to 16.0); treatment with intravenous penicillin was started. On hospital day 2, an epidural anesthetic agent was administered. Artificial rupture of the membranes revealed clear, odorless fluid, and infusion of oxytocin was started. Six hours after artificial rupture of the membranes, the patient gave birth to a healthy baby by vaginal delivery. Three minutes later, the placenta was delivered intact. Immediately after delivery, hemorrhage due to uterine atony occurred; there was an estimated blood loss of 500 ml. Bimanual massage of the uterus was performed, and oxytocin and methylergonovine were adminis- tered; hemostasis was subsequently achieved. A perineal laceration was repaired. The patient began breast-feeding, and on postpartum day 1, she was discharged. Six days before the current admission, on postpartum day 9, pain in the left upper quadrant developed. The pain was dull, radiated to the left flank and back, and was worse with movement and deep breathing. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic; urine was obtained for culture, and empirical treatment with\namoxicillin\u2013clavulanate was started.\nFive days before this admission, on postpartum day 10, abdominal pain per- sisted, and a fever with a temporal temperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed. The patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. She rated the abdominal pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. A review of systems was notable for nausea and minimal lochia; there was no diarrhea, consti- pation, dysuria, hematuria, or breast tenderness. On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness on palpation of the left upper quadrant, the uterine fundus, the supra- pubic region, and the left costovertebral angle. Pelvic examination, including examination with the use of a speculum, revealed no dehiscence, drainage, or hematoma at the site of the peri- neal laceration repair and no discharge from the cervical os; there was mild cervical motion ten- derness. The white-cell count was 20,700 per microliter. The level of hemoglobin was 11.4 g per deciliter. Blood cultures were obtained. The urine culture obtained at the urgent care clinic was positive for group B streptococcus. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with ceftriaxone was started, and the patient was admitted to the hospital for pre- sumed pyelonephritis. On hospital day 3, when the fever and abdominal pain resolved, the pa- tient was discharged home to complete a course of amoxicillin.During the subsequent 2 days, the patient continued to take amoxicillin at home, but fe- ver and abdominal and f lank pain returned. On postpartum day 15, when the pain did not abate after she took acetaminophen, she returned to the emergency department of this hospital.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included high- grade cervical dysplasia that had led to a loop electrosurgical excision procedure 5 years earlier, as well as a ruptured ovarian cyst 3 years earlier and nephrolithiasis on the left side 5 months earlier. The patient had not been pregnant be- fore the recent pregnancy; before this pregnancy, she had taken oral contraceptives for 12 years. She took prenatal vitamins, as well as polyethyl- ene glycol, docusate, acetaminophen, and ibu- profen as needed. She had no known drug aller- gies. She lived with her husband and newborn infant in an urban area of New England and worked as an office manager. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had multiple sclerosis and her father had coronary artery disease; her brother was healthy. On examination, the abdomen was soft, and there was mild tenderness in the left upper quadrant and at the left costovertebral angle. There was no tenderness on palpation of the uterine fundus or the suprapubic region and no cervical motion tenderness. The white-cell count was 10,330 per microliter. The hemoglobin level was 11.2 g per deciliter, the alanine aminotrans- ferase (ALT) level 153 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level 44 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), and the alkaline phosphatase level 194 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to this hospital. The next day, the hemoglobin level decreased to 9.7 g per deciliter. Additional studies were performed, and a diagnosis was made.\n\nTable 1.

They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\nDr. Onofrio A. Catalano: A transverse ultrasound image of the left lobe of the liver (Fig.  1A)  showed a large exophytic, heterogeneous lesion. Computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 1B and 1C), performed before and  after  the  administration  of oral and intravenous contrast material, con- firmed the presence of an exophytic mass arising from the left hepatic lobe and exerting mass ef-  fect on the stomach. The mass measured 11.1 cm  by 9.5 cm by 10.8 cm and contained spontane- ously hyperdense material that did not enhance after the administration of contrast material, a finding that was consistent with hematoma. A large nonenhancing component, which was most likely necrotic, and some vividly enhancing peripheral components were  also  seen  within the mass.\nThere was no biliary dilatation in the left\nhepatic lobe. No radiologic signs of cirrhosis, lymphadenopathy, or peritoneal or other metas- tases were identified.\n\nFigure 1.

CT images obtained before (Panel B) and after (Panel C) the administration of oral and in\u2011 travenous contrast material confirm a large exophytic mass (arrows) arising from the left hepatic lobe and exerting mass effect on the stomach. The mass con\u2011 tains spontaneously hyperdense material that does not enhance after administration of the contrast material (asterisks) and is consistent with hematoma, a large nonenhancing component that is most likely necrotic (circles), and some vividly enhancing peripheral com\u2011 ponents (arrowheads).\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lerner: The blood level of vitamin C was less than 0.1 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Results of iron studies were consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. The blood level of vita- min B1 (thiamine) was 68 nmol per liter (reference range, 70 to 180), the vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) level 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50), and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 23 ng per milliliter (57 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per milliliter [50 to 200 nmol per li- ter]). The blood levels of vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12  (cobalamin), and vitamin K were normal.\nBecause of fever and the elevated blood level of d-dimer, the patient was evaluated for venous thromboembolism by means of ultrasonography of the left leg and computed tomography with angiography of the chest; both were normal. Multiple sets of blood cultures were negative, and transthoracic echocardiography was normal, with no evidence of valvular vegetations.\nAdditional information was obtained from the primary care clinic at the other hospital. The patient\u2019s parents had frequently made changes to the patient\u2019s ketogenic diet without consult- ing the primary care clinic, and there were peri- ods during which the patient may not have re- ceived vitamins at the recommended doses. After the diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made, the patient\u2019s parents reported that he had been receiving reduced tube feedings for more than 1 month before the current admission because they thought it helped reduce vomiting and diar- rhea. Review of records from the other hospital revealed a weight decrease of 4.7 kg during the 6 weeks before this admission.\nTherefore, in addition to premature coronary artery disease, key diagnoses to rule out in this patient included a congenital anomalous coro- nary artery, coronary spasm with or without myocardial bridging, and a compressing medias- tinal mass. Angina is also common in patients with pulmonary hypertension, but this possibil- ity was deemphasized because the patient had no evidence of dilatation or dysfunction on the right side of the heart on TTE and had a normal ventilatory efficiency on cardiopulmonary exer- cise stress testing.\nThe pattern of chest discomfort developing with initial exercise and resolving with resumed exercise was consistent with a phenomenon known as warm-up angina. Warm-up angina is defined as angina that is present on initial exer- tion but is absent on, and not reproduced by, a similar second exertion; it is often explained by the recruitment of coronary collateral f low or microvascular recruitment during initial exer- cise.1,2 Given the exertional pain and the absence of atherosclerotic risk factors, a syndrome with coronary involvement, such as a congenital anomalous coronary artery, was a leading con- sideration in this patient.\n\nCongenital Anomalous Coronary Artery\nThe precise prevalence of coronary-artery anom- alies is unknown but is estimated to be approximately 1% or less in the general population.3 The majority of deaths associated with coronary- artery anomalies are thought to occur with exer- cise.4 In athletes, coronary-artery anomalies may manifest as syncope, presyncope, or at times, angina. Acute angulation of an aberrant coro- nary origin, dynamic compression by adjacent structures, and presumed obstructive ischemia are some proposed mechanisms of angina and sudden cardiac death that occur in the context  of exercise.5\nIn a large autopsy study involving military recruits, 1 in 3 cases of sudden death that oc- curred in this athletic population were found  to be caused by coronary-artery anomalies.6 The right coronary artery normally arises from the right sinus of Valsalva of the aortic root,  and the left coronary artery arises from the left sinus of Valsalva. In this study, most cases of sudden death were associated with the left coro- nary artery arising from the right sinus of Val- salva and then coursing between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. Other features that confer  a high risk of coronary-artery anomalies have been noted.7\nCoronary-artery anomalies can be detected by means of TTE of the coronary origins. However, coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiogra- phy has become increasingly available and is the test of choice in adult populations.\n\nFlushing Syndromes\nFinally, we considered whether this patient\u2019s quiescent history of exercise-induced anaphy- laxis and flushing might be associated with his clinical presentation. We considered systemic diseases, such as carcinoid syndrome, systemic mastocytosis, and pheochromocytoma, which can all cause flushing and angioedema with exer- cise. However, these are uncommon diagnoses. There was no evidence of carcinoid syndrome on TTE, and the plasma free metanephrine and normetanephrine levels were normal.\nWe thoroughly reviewed this patient\u2019s TTE. Although the study showed normal coronary origins, an anterior vascular echolucent space was identified (Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F). We per- formed coronary CT angiography to define the patient\u2019s coronary anatomy and rule out coro- nary-artery anomalies.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Anushri Parakh: Coronary CT angiography, per- formed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evi- dence of an anomalous coronary-artery origin or atherosclerotic plaque. However, a 5-cm intra- pericardial mass was detected anterior to the heart and within the aortopulmonary groove. The mass showed intense heterogeneous en- hancement and had an attenuation level of 50 Hounsfield units (HU) before the administration of contrast material, 218 HU during the arterial phase, and 111 HU during the delayed phase (Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C). The proximal right coro- nary artery was encased by the mass (Fig. 2D).\nA volume-rendered image showed multiple tiny feeding vessels leading to the mass that were arising from the proximal right coronary artery and from the middle-to-distal left anterior descending coronary artery. There was also nar- rowing of the middle left anterior descending coronary artery, a finding consistent with the steal phenomenon. The steal phenomenon oc- curs because coronary arteries are supplying the mass, and in the presence of coronary-artery stenosis, periods of vasodilation (which can oc- cur during exercise) can lead to diversion (\u201csteal\u201d) of blood flow to the mass, rather than through the coronary vessels. There was prominent ve- nous drainage of the mass (Fig. 2E, and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The structure anterior to the aorta that had been observed on TTE (Fig. 1F) was probably a collateral vessel that was supplying the mass. The radiologic differential diagnosis included paraganglioma and hemangioma.\nTo narrow the differential diagnosis, 123I-meta iodobenzylguanidine single-photon-emission CT was performed (Fig. 2F). The study showed mod- erate tracer uptake that corresponded to the mass observed on coronary CT angiography. The finding was nonspecific and could not defini- tively differentiate between paraganglioma and hemangioma.\nNext, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a heterogeneous mass that was isointense on T1-weighted images and was hy- perintense with hypointense internal foci, which resulted in a \u201csalt and pepper\u201d appearance, on T2-weighted images. After the administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material, the mass showed intense and early enhancement on first-pass perfusion images, a finding that indicated high vascularity (Fig. 3A, 3B, and 3C).\n\nFigure 2. Coronary CT Angiogram and 123I-MIBG SPECT Image.\nAn axial CT image obtained during the arterial phase (Panel A) shows an intrapericardial mass (arrow), anterior to the heart and within the aortopulmonary groove, with heterogeneous enhancement and an attenuation level of 218 Hounsfield units (HU). The attenuation level of the mass is 50 HU on an image obtained before the administration of contrast material (Panel B, arrow) and 111 HU on an im- age obtained during the delayed phase (Panel C, arrow). A sagittal CT image (Panel D) shows that the proximal right coronary artery is encased by the mass (arrow). A volume-rendered image (Panel E) shows the relationship of the mass (in purple) with the chambers on the right side (in blue) and on the left side (in red) and with the coronary arteries; there is evidence of narrowing of the left anterior de- scending coronary artery (black arrow), prominent venous drainage (white arrow), and feeding vessels arising from the right coronary artery (arrowheads). An axial image from 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) single-photon-emission CT (SPECT) (Panel F) shows moderate tracer uptake in the mass (arrow).\n",
