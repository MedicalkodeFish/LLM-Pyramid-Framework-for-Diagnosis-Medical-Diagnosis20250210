    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kathleen W. Miller (Medicine): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in early winter with fever and pancytopenia.\nThe patient, who had multiple sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before admission, when nausea and fatigue developed. Over the next 2 months, these symptoms worsened, and in the context of severe nausea, two episodes of vasovagal syncope occurred. During an evaluation for syncope, anemia was noted. Five months before admission, the patient was evaluated by her primary care provider at another hospital. The weight was 87.6 kg, and the results of physical examination were normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobala- min, folate, iron, iron saturation, and total iron-binding capacity were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Iron supplementation was prescribed.\nNausea and fatigue persisted. Three months before admission, the patient was again evaluated by her primary care provider at the other hospital. The weight was\n84.4 kg; the remainder of the examination was unchanged. Blood levels of electro- lytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed cholelithiasis and splenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 17 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal value, \u226412 cm).\nTwo and a half months before admission, the patient was evaluated in a hema- tology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She reported persistent nausea and fatigue, poor appetite with reduced oral intake, and 2 weeks of dyspnea on exertion. There was no orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The weight was 83.2 kg, and the spleen tip was palpable four fingerbreadths below the costal margin; the remainder of the physical examination was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, and examination of the bone marrow specimen revealed mildly hypercel- lular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mild dyserythropoiesis.\nTreatment with prednisone and folic acid was begun. Ocrelizumab infusions for multiple sclerosis were stopped. Nausea and fatigue persisted, and fevers and sweats developed. After 3 weeks of treatment with prednisone, the anemia had not abated and the patient had temperatures as high as 39.0\u00b0C. Testing for influenza A and B viruses was nega- tive. Two units of packed red cells were trans- fused. The course of prednisone was tapered off over the next 18 days, and the patient was referred to a hematologist affiliated with this hospital.\nIn the hematology clinic, the patient reported that the fevers had resolved but the fatigue, weak- ness, and poor appetite had worsened. She felt too fatigued to walk, and she had recently had a fall without loss of consciousness. The weight was 82.4 kg; splenomegaly was present, and the remainder of the examination was unchanged. The patient was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nIn addition to relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, there was a history of trigeminal neu- ralgia, restless legs syndrome, vasovagal synco- pe when blood samples were obtained, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level for 1 year with- out a clear cause. Medications included oxcar- bazepine, gabapentin, ropinirole, folic acid, and cholecalciferol. There were no known drug aller- gies. The patient had quit smoking 20 years ear- lier and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She lived in a suburban area of New England with her adult son and pet cat and dog. Her backyard adjoined a large wooded area where deer were often seen. She worked in health care administration. Her family history included dia- betes in her mother, lung cancer in her father, and multiple sclerosis in her sister.\nOn examination, the patient appeared pale but not unwell. The temperature was 38.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 90/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 93 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while she was breathing ambient air. The weight was 79.8\tkg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.2. The conjunctivae were pale. The heart rate was regular, with normal first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) and a soft systolic murmur. There was edema in the legs. The\nremainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were nor- mal, as were the results of serum protein elec- trophoresis and coagulation tests; other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained. Two units of packed red cells were transfused, and one dose of intrave- nous furosemide was administered. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered daily for 3 days, and the patient reported a decrease in weakness and fatigue.\nDr. Dexter P. Mendoza: On hospital day 4, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1A) revealed plenomegaly, with the spleen measuring 19 cm in the craniocaudal dimension. Concurrent pos- itron-emission tomography with injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (Fig. 1B) revealed intense uptake in the spleen and diffuse uptake in the bone marrow throughout the axial and appen- dicular skeleton.\nDr. Miller: On hospital day 5, the patient re- ported a recurrence of severe fatigue and general- ized weakness. The temperature was 39.0\u00b0C and the heart rate 130 beats per minute. The results of physical examination were otherwise unchanged. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael D. Gibbons: This 64-year-old woman presented in early winter with fever and pancytopenia after a 7-month illness that began with nausea and fatigue. This case provides an oppor- tunity to examine how we organize the myriad details of a clinical presentation. The objective is to sort through these details to build a problem representation and facilitate the identification of a specific pathologic process.1 We are reminded that details discerned at any given encounter may or may not allow the provider to recognize the pathologic process; if a crucial aspect of the problem representation has not yet developed, matching the clinical presentation to the correct illness may prove elusive. In this case, we are provided with data acquired at multiple encoun- ters during the 7-month illness, so we can build the differential diagnosis around the most rare and therefore most specific findings of the dis- ease course. I will focus on the findings of ane- mia and splenomegaly, rather than on the less specific presenting symptoms of nausea and fa- tigue. As we review this patient\u2019s clinical course, I will also compile a list of salient features that must be consistent with the final diagnosis.\n\nAnemia\nAnemia was identified in this patient 5 months before her admission to this hospital. The con- stellation of a low haptoglobin level, an elevated reticulocyte count, and a positive test for urobilinogen in the absence of hyperbilirubinemia is a pattern consistent with hemolytic anemia. In fact, the haptoglobin level can be used to dif- ferentiate a hemolytic process from a nonhemo- lytic process, because a level of less than 25 mg per deciliter is 96% specific for hemolysis. Thus, we can quickly limit our range of considerations to diseases characterized by hemolytic anemia.2\n\nHemolytic Anemia\nCauses of hemolysis can be divided into the fol- lowing categories: disorders inherent to the red- cell structure, conditions resulting in mechanical injury to erythrocytes, immune-mediated disease, infections, and toxic effects. Disorders inherent to the red-cell structure, including enzymopathy, membranopathy, and hemoglobinopathy, would be expected to develop earlier in life than this patient\u2019s illness and would be unlikely to cause the systemic symptoms central to this case. Conditions that can result in mechanical injury, including march hemoglobinuria, aortic steno- sis, the presence of mechanical prosthetic heart valves, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, are not consistent with this patient\u2019s history. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia would be unlikely to have an indolent disease course and to occur without evidence of coagulopathy or end-organ damage. Immune-mediated hemoly- sis, caused by a transfusion reaction or autoim- mune hemolytic anemia, is a possibility in this patient; however, her hemolysis predated her first transfusion, and a direct Coombs\u2019 test was negative. There is no evidence of envenomation or a toxic exposure, but infections that lead to hemolysis are possible. These include infections with intracellular parasites, such as malaria and babesiosis, as well as other infections.\nSplenomegaly\nCauses of splenomegaly can be divided into mul- tiple mechanistic categories. Spleen enlargement can be due to congestion caused by portal hyper- tension, a condition characteristically encoun- tered in patients with hepatic cirrhosis that may result in sequestration of leukocytes, erythro- cytes, and platelets, with resultant cytopenias. However, portal hypertension would cause non- hemolytic anemia, and this patient had no known liver disease on the basis of her history and imaging studies. Spleen enlargement can also result from infiltrative processes, such as amyloi- dosis and sarcoidosis; myeloproliferative processes arising from cell lineages that commonly reside in the spleen, such as chronic leukemias, lymphomas, and other hematologic cancers; various infections, such as those caused by Epstein\u2013 Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and mycobacteria, including tuberculosis; and auto- immune processes, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nSalient Features\nIf we are to accurately describe and identify the pathologic process in this case, we must account for the initial features of the patient\u2019s illness: nausea and fatigue. The 7-month disease course is also an important feature. During this time, the patient received multiple blood transfusions and did not have a clinically significant recovery, which suggests that she had ongoing hemolysis for at least 5 months. The illness developed in a middle-aged woman with chronic autoimmune disease who was receiving ocrelizumab, a potent CD20 inhibitor that depletes populations of B cells. The administration of glucocorticoids on two separate occasions resulted in clinical deteriora- tion; the lack of benefit after the administration of glucocorticoids suggests that her illness is un- likely to be due to an autoimmune condition. Fi- nally, on admission, multiple laboratory values, including the d-dimer, C-reactive protein, and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels, were substan- tially elevated. In alternative clinical scenarios, these laboratory abnormalities could lead to a diagnosis, but in this case, they are a collective signal that inflammation, perhaps excessive in- flammation, is a hallmark of the disease process.\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis\nThe constellation of fever, splenomegaly, cytope- nias, and an escalated inflammatory response is characteristic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocy- tosis (HLH). This syndrome was initially diag- nosed and categorized in children. When it occurs in children, it is due to a genetic abnormality that impairs the natural death of T cells and natural killer cells. HLH with a genetic cause would be unlikely to first develop in a 64-year-old patient.\nHowever, HLH has increasingly been recog- nized in adults. When it occurs in adults, it is due to immune hyperactivation initially triggered by an autoimmune, malignant, or infectious process. Characteristic features of HLH in adults include fever, cytopenias, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated levels of inflammatory markers, and most specifically, the presence of hemophagocy- tosis on examination of bone marrow aspirate. Although published diagnostic criteria for HLH may not be applicable in adults,3 the HScore is a diagnostic tool for HLH that has been validated in adults and can be calculated for this patient.4 On the basis of her laboratory values, this pa- tient had an HScore of 206, which corresponds to a high likelihood of HLH.When the diagnosis of HLH is considered in an adult patient, it is imperative to investigate for an underlying trigger. Treatment of the underly- ing cause is commonly sufficient in abrogating the inflammatory hyperimmune response.\nEpstein\u2013Barr Virus Infection\nMultiple members of the human herpesvirus family have been associated with HLH. The most commonly identified infectious cause of HLH is Epstein\u2013Barr virus,6 which is an intriguing pos- sibility in a patient who presented with a sub- acute illness characterized by fatigue and sple- nomegaly. Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection can also be associated with hemolysis; however, it is more often mediated by cold agglutinins, so the nega- tive direct Coombs\u2019 test in this case makes this diagnosis unlikely.\nBabesiosis\nParasitic infections can result in inflammation and, in rare cases, can even progress to full HLH.7 Given this patient\u2019s exposure to a wooded area in the northeastern United States, the possibility of babesiosis must be considered. Babesia microti, which is carried by the deer tick Ixodes scapularis and is endemic in this region, is an intraerythro- cytic parasite. Infection with this parasite causes direct hemolysis, as well as immune-mediated hemolysis when the presence of its antigen on the red-cell surface leads to opsonization and phago- cytosis by splenic macrophages. In addition, splenomegaly commonly develops in response to the increased clearance of damaged or infected erythrocytes. Patients with babesiosis typically present in the summer months with an acute febrile illness. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common. Patients who have undergone splenec- tomy and patients who are immunosuppressed may have a more fulminant course. Although babesiosis is typically considered to be a self- limited illness with a subclinical or acute presen- tation, persistent parasitemia even after appropri- ate antimicrobial therapy has been described.\nAll the features of this patient\u2019s presentation\n\u2014 including fever, hemolytic anemia with nega- tive direct Coombs\u2019 test, splenomegaly, gastroin- testinal symptoms, and fatigue \u2014 can be ex- plained by chronic babesiosis, possibly as a trigger for HLH. Although this patient presented in early winter, her exposure to babesia probably dated back to spring, a time of year when tick- borne diseases commonly occur in New England. To establish the diagnosis of babesiosis in this patient, I would examine thick and thin blood smears to look for intraerythrocytic parasites con- sistent with babesia or perform babesia-specific nucleic acid testing of the blood.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Julian A. Villalba: Because laboratory test re- sults indicated the presence of hemolysis, a standard direct antiglobulin test, known as the direct Coombs\u2019 test, was performed. The test was nonreactive to both anti-IgG and anti-C3 reagents. In addition, an enhanced direct Coombs\u2019 test with a wash of cold low-ionic- strength saline solution was negative. Finally, an extended direct Coombs\u2019 test with anti-IgG, anti- IgA, anti-IgM, anti-C3c, and anti-C3d reagents was also negative. These findings are consistent with non\u2013immune-mediated hemolysis.\nThe bone marrow specimen obtained before admission was reviewed. On histologic examina- tion (Fig. 2A), the marrow was mildly hypercel- lular for the patient\u2019s age and showed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with a normal ratio of myeloid to erythroid cells. On examination of a touch preparation slide (Fig. 2B through 2G), the marrow showed rare dysplastic erythroid cells with nuclear irregularities, nuclear budding, multinucleation, and mild nuclear\u2013cytoplasmic asynchrony. Myeloid maturation was normal, and the percentage of myeloblasts (1%) was not increased. Iron staining revealed normal iron stores and no pathologic ring sideroblasts. Im- munophenotyping of marrow cells by means of flow cytometry did not reveal clonal B-cell or phenotypically abnormal T-cell populations. Nei- ther the histologic examination of the core bi- opsy specimen nor the examination of the touch preparation slide revealed evidence of hemo- phagocytosis. In this patient with unexplained non\u2013immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, the finding of mildly hypercellular marrow with mild dyserythropoiesis suggests increased bone marrow erythropoiesis in response to an under- lying hemolytic process. These bone marrow morphologic features are on the spectrum of those reported in patients with non\u2013immune- mediated disease processes that lead to intravas- cular hemolysis, such as inherited blood disor- ders,11 microangiopathic disorders,12 congenital dyserythropoietic anemia,13 drug toxicity,14 and intraerythrocytic infectious processes.15,16\nAfter the patient was admitted to this hospital, an examination of a peripheral blood smear was performed in the hematology laboratory. The examination revealed polychromasia, baso- philic stippling, nucleated red cells, and intra- erythrocytic structures suggestive of parasitic forms. Therefore, a blood sample was sent to the parasitology laboratory for an examination of thick and thin peripheral blood smears. Ex- amination of the smears with light microscopy (Fig. 3) confirmed the presence of numerous pleiomorphic nonpigmented intraerythrocytic parasitic forms of different sizes. These included ring-shaped and pyriform trophozoites and oc- casional cruciform merozoites arranged in a tet- rad (\u201cMaltese cross\u201d) pattern. Occasional clusters of clumped extracellular merozoites were also seen. These morphologic features are consistent with babesia. Additional blood tests performed to rule out infection with other tickborne patho- gens \u2014 including a polymerase-chain-reaction assay for anaplasma and ehrlichia species and an enzyme immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM to the VlsE1 (variable major protein\u2013like sequence E1) protein antigen of Borrelia burgdorferi \u2014 were negative.\n\n",
