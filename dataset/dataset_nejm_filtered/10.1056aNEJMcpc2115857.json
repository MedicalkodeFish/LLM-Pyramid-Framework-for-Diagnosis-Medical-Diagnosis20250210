    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Michael D. Kritzer: A 57-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and coro- navirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was evaluated at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because she was having delusions that she was dead.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 weeks before this presentation, when myalgias, cough, sore throat, nausea, and vomiting developed. She sought evaluation at the primary care clinic of an academic medical center affiliated with this hospital (the two hospitals are part of the same health care system). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA, and the patient was instructed to quarantine at home. She lived with her father and assisted him with activities of daily living; he also received a diagnosis of Covid-19.\nDuring the following week, the patient\u2019s cough persisted, and new shortness of breath developed. Her symptoms worsened; she felt that she was unable to take care of her father. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient and her father were taken to the emergency department of the other hospital, where they were both admitted for worsening Covid-19 pneumonia. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. Treatment with rem- desivir was stopped on hospital day 4 when the blood aminotransferase levels increased to three times the upper limit of the normal range.\nDuring the hospitalization, the patient was noted to have intermittent anxiety, particularly when discharge planning for her father was discussed. She and her brother declined to have their father discharged to a rehabilitation center and in- stead planned for him to eventually return home to quarantine with the patient. On hospital day 6, the patient\u2019s oxygen saturation was normal while she was breathing ambient air, and the blood aminotransferase levels had improved. She was discharged home with instructions to quarantine and continue taking dexa- methasone.\nOne day after discharge, the patient\u2019s brother spoke to her on the telephone.He thought that she seemed to be confused and unable to take care of herself, and he asked her to return to the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient explained that she was unsure why her brother had asked her to return to the hos- pital, and she said that she wanted to go home. She also expressed that she felt anxious about being home alone after discharge and over- whelmed about needing to care for her father at home once he was discharged from the hospital. The myalgias, cough, and shortness of breath had abated; she had no fevers, visual or auditory hallucinations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. The patient had a history of major depressive disorder, which had been diagnosed during the second decade of life. At the time of diagnosis, she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital and had received electroconvulsive therapy; there- after, she had been discharged to a partial hos- pital program. She had been hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms twice since then, once for major depressive disorder and once for a mixed bipolar episode that was due to insomnia and anxious distress. The latter episode was associ- ated with catatonic features and was treated with electroconvulsive therapy.\nThe patient had no history of suicidal or homicidal ideation or attempts and no history of violence. She had hypertension, diabetes, obe- sity, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Medi- cations included dexamethasone, bupropion, fluoxetine, olanzapine, losartan, metformin, and pantoprazole. Sulfa drugs had caused angio- edema, and lisinopril had caused cough. The patient was born in the Caribbean and had emi- grated four decades earlier, first to southwestern Europe and then to the United States 2 years later. She lived in an apartment in an urban area of New England with her father, who had mild dementia. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit substances.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 97 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure 153/95 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented but guarded, with a flat affect. She appeared to be more anxious than she had been during the previous hospitalization. She paced around the room and perseverated about the care of her fa- ther. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver-func- tion and kidney-function tests. The white-cell count was 11,490 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance; the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Urinalysis and a radio- graph of the chest were normal. Treatment  with dexamethasone was stopped, and the pa- tient was admitted to the hospital to facilitate discharge to a rehabilitation center for contin- ued care.\nOn hospital day 3, the patient was noted to be more withdrawn, and she began responding to questions with one-word answers or silence. When she was encouraged to speak more, she continued to perseverate about the care of her father. When she was asked to elaborate on her concerns, she stated, \u201cHe is dead. I am dead.\u201d\nThe patient appeared disheveled, sullen, and anxious. She laid in bed motionless with her eyes open and looking forward, and she re- sponded briefly to questions in a quiet voice with slowed speech. Her thoughts were persev- erative and tangential. There was no evidence that she had loosening of associations, halluci- nations, or suicidal or homicidal ideation. She had poor insight and judgment. Memory, atten- tion, concentration, abstract reasoning, and fund of knowledge were normal. When her arms and legs were lifted against gravity and  released,  they fell to the bed without resistance; with en- couragement, she was able to move them. Mus- cle tone was normal, with no rigidity or waxy flexibility. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Aaron B. Paul: Computed tomography (CT)\nof the head (Fig. 1), performed without the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no evidence of an acute territorial in- farct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was nonspecific moderate confluent hypoattenu- ation involving the supratentorial white matter.\nDr. Kritzer: Clonazepam was administered, and the dose of olanzapine was increased. Admis- sion to an inpatient psychiatric unit was recom- mended. During the next week, while awaiting placement  in an inpatient psychiatric unit, the patient continued to show signs of anxiety and a depressed mood. She said, \u201cI am dead. I do not exist. I am not real.\u201d She also believed that her father and brother, as well as her nurses and doctors, were dead. The patient was selectively mute and motionless, but she talked and moved with encouragement. She expressed that she felt directly responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic and asked to be thrown out of the window. She had the sensation that her bladder was gone and that she could not urinate, although she had been observed urinating independently. She felt that she could not eat, although she had been observed eating breakfast daily. On hospital day 9, the patient was transferred to the inpatient psychiatric unit of the other hospital.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Gregory L. Fricchione: In this 57-year-old woman with metabolic syndrome and a mixed affective disorder suggestive of bipolar disorder, neuro- psychiatric symptoms developed 2 weeks after the onset of Covid-19. The patient had psycho- motor agitation, a f lat affect, and anxious per- severation that was focused on her father\u2019s care. Three days later, she was noted to become mo- tionless and hypophonic, with staring, speech latency, and verbal perseveration. Cognition was intact, but insight and judgment were impaired. In an attempt to explain her neuropsychiatric symptoms, I will consider the potential effects of medications that she had received, her un- derlying psychiatric disease, and her recent in- fection.\nMedication Effects\nThis patient was receiving several medications for the treatment of a mixed affective disorder, including bupropion, fluoxetine, and olanzapine. Antidepressant medications could trigger a sec- ondary manic episode, especially in this patient with suspected bipolar disorder. However, her presentation was not typical of drug-related ma- nia, which has classic symptoms of insomnia, euphoria or irritability, extreme hyperactivity, and pressured speech. Although she was receiv- ing psychotropic medications that have been associated with serotonin syndrome, there were no findings suggestive of this diagnosis, such as clonus, tremor, ataxia, hyperreflexia, or fever.1\nThis patient had recently started taking dexa- methasone for the treatment of Covid-19. Gluco- corticoids, particularly when administered at high doses, are potential triggers of a manic response commonly referred to as \u201csteroid- induced psychosis.\u201d The use of glucocorticoids can cause a myriad of neuropsychiatric affective, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms.2 The per- sistence of this patient\u2019s psychotic symptoms after the discontinuation of dexamethasone ar- gues against the diagnosis of glucocorticoid- associated psychosis, although it is possible that dexamethasone triggered an underlying primary psychiatric disorder.\nSeizures\nThe patient was noted to appear withdrawn, and at times, she would lie motionless and not re- spond to questions. These episodes suggest the possibility of complex partial seizures. Status epilepticus, including nonconvulsive status epilepticus, has been reported in patients with Covid-19.3 In addition, the patient was taking bupropion, a medication that has been associ- ated with lowering of the seizure threshold. However, if her diminished responsiveness were due to nonconvulsive status epilepticus, I would expect her to have phases of deeper unrespon- siveness fluctuating with brief phases of alert- ness with confusion. Because complex partial seizure disorder is often difficult to diagnose, I would perform long-term electroencephalo- graphic (EEG) monitoring, while considering alternative diagnoses.\n\nAutoimmune Encephalitis\nCould this patient have autoimmune limbic en- cephalitis? The neuropsychiatric symptoms ap- pear to have had a subacute onset followed by rapid progression, which suggests  involvement of the limbic system. In addition, the white- matter changes observed on CT of the head sug- gest bilateral brain abnormalities. However, if the patient had autoimmune limbic encephalitis, I would expect white-matter changes to be re- stricted to the medial temporal lobes and an EEG to show focal temporal slowing.4 I would perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and a lumbar puncture for cerebrospi- nal fluid (CSF) analysis to help rule out the diag- nosis of autoimmune encephalitis, especially given the potential association of this condition with Covid-19.5,6 Encephalitis associated with anti\u2013N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor anti- bodies can lead to a neuropsychiatric presenta- tion that often includes catatonic withdrawal, and it has been associated with viral illnesses.7     A connection between encephalitis associated with anti\u2013NMDA receptor antibodies and SARS- CoV-2 has not yet been established, but a poten- tial relationship has been suggested.8\n\nNeuropsychiatric Symptoms Associated with Covid-19\nCould this patient\u2019s neuropsychiatric symptoms be related to her recent diagnosis of Covid-19? Early studies suggested that more than one third of patients with Covid-19 had a neuropsychiatric syndrome.9\nSome cases of Covid-19 lead to persistent symptoms or long-term complications that ex- tend beyond acute disease (a condition some-\n \ntimes referred to as postacute syndrome of Covid-19 or \u201clong Covid\u201d).10 In such cases, neuropsychiatric symptoms can include fatigue, myalgias, headache, anxiety, depression, dysauto- nomia, and cognitive impairment (also referred to as \u201cbrain fog\u201d).\nIn one study involving more than 60,000 pa- tients with Covid-19, 18% of the patients had received a psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after infection.11 Neuroinf lammation is thought to play a role in Covid-19\u2013related neuro- psychiatric disorders,12,13 and persistent autoanti- bodies have been detected in the CSF of patients with these conditions.13-15\nNew-onset psychosis has been reported in patients with Covid-19. In one report describing\n10 patients, psychotic symptoms developed at least 2 weeks after the onset of Covid-19 symp- toms, and structured delusions were common.16 A recent systematic review of Covid-19\u2013related psychosis cases confirmed that delusions were the most commonly reported psychotic symp- tom.17 Of note, the majority of patients with Covid-19\u2013related psychosis had only mild acute Covid-19 symptoms.\nCT of the head performed in this patient re- vealed subcortical white-matter disease. The most frequent neuroimaging abnormalities ob- served in patients with Covid-19 involve white- matter changes.18 Covid-19 has been associated with several white-matter diseases, including Covid-19\u2013related disseminated leukoencepha- lopathy and cerebral autosomal dominant arteri- opathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoen- cephalopathy (CADASIL).19,20 However, in this patient, there was no report of features that would be suggestive of these diagnoses, such as a clinically significant reduction in the level of consciousness, headaches, cranial nerve signs, sensorimotor deficits, gait defects, or changes in the deep-tendon reflexes. In addition, there were no other CT findings, such as microhemor- rhages or lacunar infarcts. MRI of the head would be the next step to help rule out neuropsy- chiatric complications of Covid-19.\nCatatonia\nThis patient had several features suggestive of catatonia. If the Bush\u2013Francis Catatonia Rating Scale were used, this patient would acquire points for mutism, withdrawal, immobility and stupor, staring, verbal perseveration, and auto- nomic instability, with a score of approximately 13 (on a scale ranging from 0 to 23, with higher scores indicating more severe catatonia).21 On the basis of these reported findings on examina- tion, the patient would meet the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), for catatonia associated with a major mood disorder and a general medical condition (Table 1).22\nCatatonia is a disorder of the cingulate cor- tico\u2013striato\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical circuits that re- sults in the disconnection of motivation and movement, and it has multiple neuromedical and psychiatric causes.23,24 Catatonia has been reported in several patients with Covid-19.25 In a small study that evaluated the results of posi-  tron-emission tomography and CT of the head performed in patients with Covid-19 encepha- lopathy, there was evidence of persistent hypo- metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and caudate cortico\u2013 striato\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical network.26\nIt is possible that this patient had Covid-19\u2013 related changes in the blood\u2013brain barrier and choroid plexus that disrupted the cingulate cortico\u2013striato\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical circuits and increased her risk of catatonia. Neuroleptic-\n \ninduced catatonia related to the use of olanza- pine is another possibility. In addition, the pa- tient had a history of hospitalization for probable bipolar affective psychosis and catatonia, and bi- polar disorder is the most common cause of psychogenic catatonia. There was no history suggestive of catatonia caused by conversion disorder.\nThe patient\u2019s catatonic symptoms abated af- ter treatment with a benzodiazepine, which is the first-line treatment for catatonia. However, one of the most striking features of her presen- tation remains to be explained: her persistent thoughts that she was dead.\n\nCotard\u2019s Syndrome\nThis patient expressed self-deprecation and guilt about not being able to care for her father, and she had mood-congruent delusions that she and others were dead, along with a delusion that her bladder had disappeared. Her presentation is consistent with Cotard\u2019s syndrome, a syndrome included in the DSM-5 category of delusional misidentification syndromes.27,28 Patients with Cotard\u2019s syndrome have nihilistic delusions, such as the belief that they are dead, have lost their souls, or are rotting inside, without func- tional organs or limbs. Three subtypes of Co- tard\u2019s syndrome have been described: psychotic depression (a disorder associated with melan- cholia and nihilistic delusions), type 1 (a non- depressive delusional disorder), and type 2 (a dis- order associated with mixed symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and auditory hallucina- tions).29 Cotard\u2019s syndrome has been reported in at least one patient with Covid-19,30 and catato- nia and Cotard\u2019s syndrome may occur concur- rently.31,32\nSupport  and reassurance are key in the  treat-\nment of patients with Cotard\u2019s syndrome, but trying to talk patients out of their delusions is futile. Successful treatment of the underlying condition often helps the delusions to recede, although the delusions may wax and wane in patients with persistent depression and may be- come chronic in patients with schizophrenia. Multiple antipsychotic medications have been reported to reduce the symptoms of Cotard\u2019s syndrome. If medications fail, electroconvulsive therapy is an important therapeutic option. This patient had received electroconvulsive therapy in the past for the treatment of catatonia, and such therapy has a broad spectrum of effects for the treatment of multiple delusional conditions, in- cluding Cotard\u2019s syndrome.27 Transcranial mag- netic stimulation has had some promising ef- fects in patients with catatonia.\nI suspect that this patient had neuroinflam- mation associated with Covid-19 that contribut- ed to depression, catatonia, and Cotard\u2019s syn- drome.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Kritzer: After the patient arrived in the in-patient psychiatric unit of the other hospital, a nurse witnessed a generalized tonic\u2013clonic sei- zure that lasted 30 seconds and was accompa- nied by urinary incontinence. Intravenous loraze- pam and levetiracetam were administered, and the patient was transferred to the medical clinic of the other hospital for further care. The evalu- ation for precipitating causes of the seizure in- cluded a lumbar puncture for CSF analysis, includ- ing CSF testing for antibodies associated with autoimmune encephalitis, which was negative. The blood magnesium level was low, and there was evidence of a urinary tract infection. Addi- tional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Paul: MRI of the head (Fig. 2) revealed no\nevidence of an acute infarct, intracranial mass, or hemorrhage. There was moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter. The study did not show preferen- tial involvement of the anterior temporal lobes and external capsules or show subcortical in- farcts, findings that would suggest the diagno- sis of CADASIL.34 In addition, the study did not show restricted diffusion or microhemorrhages within the juxtacortical white matter, findings that would suggest the diagnosis of Covid-19\u2013 associated diffuse leukoencephalopathy and mi- crohemorrhages.35 There was no intracranial hemorrhage, which would suggest cerebral amy- loid   angiopathy.36     There   was  mild generalized parenchymal volume loss that was advanced given the patient\u2019s age. The hippocampi were normal with respect to size, signal, and mor- phologic features. No cause of seizure was identified.\nFigure 2. MRI of the Head.\nAn axial fluid\u2011attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel A) shows moderate confluent hypoattenuation involving the supratentorial white matter (arrow), a finding consistent with small\u2011vessel change, which is advanced given the patient\u2019s age. There is equivalent prominence of the ventricles and sulci (arrowheads), a finding consistent with mild generalized parenchymal volume loss, which is also advanced given the patient\u2019s age. A coronal T2\u2011weighted image (Panel B) shows that the hippocampi are normal with respect to size, signal, and morphologic features (arrows). An axial T1\u2011weighted image (Panel C), obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows no abnormal enhancement of the brain parenchyma. An axial diffusion\u2011weighted image (Panel D) shows no restricted diffusion. An axial gradient\u2013echo image (Panel E) shows no susceptibility signal. There is no evidence of a cause or consequence of seizure.\n",
