    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Zachary A. Sporn (Medicine): A 38-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of dyspnea, chest discomfort, and nodules on chest imaging.\nThree years before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by an ortho- pedist for pain in the hips and lower back, and glucocorticoid injections were administered. Twenty-two months before the current admission, the patient pre- sented to her primary care physician because of diarrhea; 4 months later, she was evaluated by her primary care physician for bloody diarrhea. Testing of a stool specimen for giardia antigen, cryptosporidium antigen, and Clostridioides difficile toxin was negative. The blood level of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA was undetectable, and the level of IgA was normal. A stool culture grew Bacillus cereus.  The  patient  was  evaluated  by  a  gastroenterologist;  colonoscopy  reportedly revealed markedly erythematous mucosa in the rectum, ending 10 cm proximal to the anus, with granularity and loss of vascularity. A biopsy specimen obtained during the colonoscopy reportedly showed evidence of diffuse active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesalamine was started, but her symptoms did not abate; the treatment was stopped after 4 months.\nDuring the next several months, the patient noticed progressive dyspnea and fatigue with exercise. Eight months before the current admission, she reported diffuse body and joint aches, especially of the lower back and hips, which pre- vented her from being able to run. Seven months before the current admission, she reported erythema, swelling, and pruritus in the right eye.\nThree months before the current admission, there was a recurrence of bloody diarrhea, and colonoscopy was repeated. Examination reportedly revealed perianal skin tags; congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectum, which was biopsied; and two 5-mm colonic polyps, which were excised.\nDr. T. Leif Helland: Histopathological examination of the biopsy specimens ob-\ntained during colonoscopy reportedly revealed a tubular adenoma and a sessile serrated polyp, as well as moderately active chronic colitis. Treatment with mesal- amine was resumed.\nDr. Sporn: The next month, while doing heavy housework, the patient had new dyspnea and bilateral pleuritic chest-wall pain  that  was  great- er on the left side than on the right side, and she had to stop doing housework. The pain persisted for several days, the dyspnea worsened, and the patient presented to the  emergency  department of another hospital. On evaluation, she had di- minished breath sounds and a normal electro- cardiogram. Laboratory test results were notable for a normal N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level and normal white-cell and differential counts. The troponin I level was undetectable, and the D-dimer level was 3150 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500). A test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was negative. Blood cultures were obtained.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Chest radiography re- portedly revealed bilateral focal, patchy airspace opacities (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism but showed multifocal pulmonary nodules that measured up to 18 mm in diameter (Fig. 1B), pleural effusions, and a kidney stone in the left kidney.\nDr. Sporn: A 5-day course of doxycycline,\nazithromycin, and prednisone was prescribed. Thirteen days later, approximately 2 months be- fore the current admission, the patient returned to the emergency department of the other hospi- tal because of continued dyspnea on exertion. The blood cultures that had been obtained dur- ing the previous visit to the emergency depart- ment were reportedly negative. White-cell and differential counts were normal, and the procal- citonin level was undetectable.\nDr. Shepard: Repeat chest radiography report-\nedly revealed persistent consolidations and in- creased pleural effusion.\nDr. Sporn: An additional 5-day course of pred-\nnisone and as-needed inhaled albuterol were pre- scribed. Four weeks later (approximately 5 weeks before the current admission), the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the other hospi- tal. The patient reported pleuritic pain on the right side of the chest; her symptoms and imag- ing findings were thought to be related to multi- focal pneumonia and parapneumonic effusions. A 3-week tapering course of prednisone was prescribed.\nAfter completion of the prednisone course, the patient reported dyspnea with labored breath- ing, orthopnea, and chest discomfort. Repeat chest CT was performed, and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital. Dr. Shepard: The repeat chest CT, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed resolution of some of the nod- ules in the lingula and right upper lobe but also an overall increased number of nodules (Fig. 1C\nand 1D).\nDr. Sporn: Six days after her repeat chest CT (6 days before the current  admission),  the  pa- tient was evaluated at the pulmonary  clinic  of  this hospital. She reported that  the  prednisone had reduced the pain in the right side of  her  chest. Her exercise capacity had decreased from being able to run 5 miles to having dyspnea after running less than half a mile. A review of sys-  tems was notable for occasional night sweats, weight gain of 15 kg in the past year, a faint rash on the abdomen, blurred vision with swelling of the right eyelid that had lasted for 3 weeks, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon,  diffuse  joint  stiffness and pain, and swelling of the fingers that limited some movements, such as opening jars. She had  no fevers, chills, cough, nose or throat symp- toms, eye pain or visual field loss, wheezing, palpitations, dizziness, nausea,  vomiting,  chang- es in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or neuro- logic symptoms. She reported no sick contacts.\nMedical history was notable for hypothyroid-\nism, multiple kidney stones, and depression. Med- ications included mesalamine, levothyroxine, and escitalopram, as well as lorazepam and inhaled albuterol as needed.\nThe patient had smoked one pack of ciga- rettes per day for 5 years but had quit approxi- mately 20 years before the current admission. She used cannabis oil, but there was no other history of substance use. She previously worked as an educator but had left her job because of ill- ness. She lived in a small town in New England with her spouse and three children. Birds and cats were kept in the home, and she had previ- ously had a cat bite. She reported that she had had no other environmental or occupational ex- posures. There was no travel history except for a commercial vacation cruise. Family history in- cluded celiac disease in her mother and lung cancer in her maternal grandfather, who had been a long-term smoker.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 129/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Examination was notable for intermittent shal- low breathing and faint crackles in the right lung. The right eyelid was erythematous and mildly swollen.\n\nFigure 1. Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nA chest radiograph obtained 2 months before the current admission (Panel A) shows bilateral focal, patchy opacities (arrows) and a small right pleural effusion. A CT angiogram (Panel B), obtained after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, rules out pulmonary embolism but shows multifocal pulmonary nodules (arrows) and small pleural effusions. CT images obtained 2 months later (12 days before the current admission) (Panels C and D), show new pulmonary nodules (arrows) and partial resolution of nodules in the lingula and right upper lobe (Panel D, circles). CT images obtained on admission (Panels E and F) show persistent pulmonary nodules with surrounding ground-glass opacities (arrows) and small pleural effusion in the right lung.\n\nTable 1.

The ranges used at Massachusetts General Hospital are for adults who are not pregnant and do not have medical conditions that could affect the results. They may therefore not be appropriate for all patients.\n\nBlood levels of creatine kinase, aldolase, and rheumatoid factor were normal. Anti-Ro, anti- La, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti\u2013Jo-1, anti\u2013Scl-70, anti\u2013human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide, and antineu- trophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not detect- ed. Serum tests for cryptococcal antigen and 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan were negative, as were urine tests for blastomyces, coccidioides, and histo- plasma antigens. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a hypersensitiv- ity pneumonitis panel were also negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital, and repeat CT imaging was scheduled.\nDuring the next 6 days, dyspnea worsened, and diffuse pain with involvement of the chest and fingers persisted. The patient was admitted to the medicine unit of this hospital for addi- tional evaluation. The temporal temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/85 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 99% while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to take intermittent, shallow breaths. There were no ulcers or lesions in the oropharynx. A faint erythematous rash was noted under the breasts, but no other rashes were present. Chest discomfort was not repro- ducible with palpation. There was no swelling, warmth, or erythema of the joints.\nBlood levels of high-sensitivity troponin T, NT-proBNP, angiotensin-converting enzyme, galactomannan antigen, and C3 and C4 were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urine levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies were undetectable.\nDr. Shepard: High-resolution chest CT (Fig. 1E\nand 1F) revealed persistent bilateral solid lung nodules with surrounding ground-glass opaci- ties and a small pleural effusion in the right lung. Gallstones and kidney stones were also visible.\nDr. Sporn: On the second hospital day, an oph-\nthalmologic examination performed after dila- tion revealed blepharitis with a foamy tear layer; there was no uveitis. Oral doxycycline and eye rinses were administered.\nOn the third hospital day, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed trace right-to-left shunt- ing through a patent foramen ovale but was otherwise was normal. Antitreponemal antibod- ies, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin IgM and IgG, and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 IgM and IgG were undetectable.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Aneesh B. Singhal: In this 68-year-old man, multiple focal and nonfocal neurologic deficits developed over a period of 7 weeks, along with cognitive decline. Imaging revealed  accumulat-  ing multifocal small ischemic lesions and white- matter lesions. In addition, lung and  kidney masses that were suggestive of cancer were identified. Determining the cause of the strokes   in this patient is important to assess the risk of recurrence and initiate appropriate preventive therapy. The correlation between clinical and imaging findings provides important diagnostic clues, as does the distribution of the ischemic lesions. Stroke classification schemas1,2 can be helpful in considering potential mechanisms  of the strokes in this patient.\n\nMechanisms of Stroke\nSmall-Vessel Disease\nAlthough this patient had small infarcts, small- vessel disease can be ruled out as the cause of his strokes because he did not have a lacunar syndrome. Patients with stroke that is caused by small-vessel disease typically have single infarcts in the distribution of penetrating cerebral arter- ies, which have been affected by lipohyalinosis associated with chronic hypertension and have become occluded.3\n\nCardioembolism\nThis patient had longstanding atrial fibrillation, which is the most frequent cause of stroke in the United States. At the time of his initial presenta- tion, 7.5 weeks before the current admission, he was not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, which reduces the risk of stroke by approxi- mately 60%. He had aphasia and hemianopia, which are typical of cardioembolism to the left middle cerebral artery. However, imaging re- vealed scattered small infarcts in deep regions of the brain and not the wedge-shaped larger in farcts that are more typical of atrial fibrillation\u2013 related stroke.\nAphasia recurred a few days later, but imag- ing revealed no new brain lesions. The aphasia was attributed to poststroke recrudescence, which is a consequence of previous stroke that has been characterized within the past decade.4 This patient\u2019s third and fourth hospital admis- sions were due to confusion and changes in his affect and gait, which do not fit into typical clinical stroke syndromes.5 Instead, he probably had embolic encephalopathy.6\nThe rapidly progressive clinical presentation and the infarct distribution suggest the possibil- ity of embolism that is caused by a condition other than atrial fibrillation, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, aortic arch athero- ma (cholesterol embolism), infective endocardi- tis, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, cardiac tumor, or cardiomyopathy. However, the patient had a normal platelet count, negative blood cul- tures, and no abnormalities on echocardiogra- phy, and he did not have symptoms of systemic infection. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocardi- tis remains a possibility, given the likelihood of underlying cancer. However, this condition invariably results in much larger multifocal in- farcts, which are presumably due to the embolic burden associated with underlying cancer- related hypercoagulability and friable valvular vegetations.6\n\nLarge-Artery Atherosclerosis\nThis patient had several risk factors for athero- sclerosis: older age, untreated atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smok- ing, marijuana use, and a family history of early- onset coronary artery disease. It was not surpris- ing that imaging showed atherosclerosis in the extracranial and intracranial arteries, as well as white-matter lesions, which were possibly due to chronic microvascular ischemia. However, he had frequent episodes within a 4-week period, which would not be typical of stroke that is caused by atherosclerosis, especially in the con- text of treatment with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants.7 It is possible that underlying atherosclerosis and chronic microvascular ische- mia lowered the threshold for stroke associated with other mechanisms.\nUndetermined and Other Causes\nThis patient could have had a condition known as cryptogenic embolic stroke of undetermined source. Recent studies have elucidated occult causes of this condition that can be identified with focused testing.8\nIn this patient, the overall differential diag- nosis can be narrowed on the basis of the rapid clinical progression, the infarct distribution, and the absence of nonatherosclerotic arteriopathy on CT angiography. It is important to note the location of the infarcts in the deep regions of the brain (e.g., the cerebral peduncle and forceps minor). Embolic showers from a central embolic source (e.g., a thrombus in the left atrial ap- pendage in a patient with atrial fibrillation who is not receiving anticoagulation) usually travel to distal cortical regions. In contrast, the deep loca- tion of the infarcts in this patient favors arterial thrombosis as the cause of his strokes.\n\n \nSmall-Vessel Cerebral Arteriopathies\nApproach to Diagnosis\nThis patient probably had small-vessel cerebral arteriopathy. The differential diagnosis for small- vessel cerebral arteriopathy is broad (Table 1). Diagnosis of a specific arteriopathy relies on factors such as the patient\u2019s age, the family his- tory, the tempo of progression, the presence of systemic signs (e.g., skin and retinal lesions) and extracerebral neurologic deficits (e.g., neuropa- thy), the features observed on imaging of the brain and vasculature, and the results of diag- nostic tests, including tests for inflammatory and cancer biomarkers, genetic tests, cerebrospi- nal fluid (CSF) analysis, and biopsy of the skin, temporal artery, and brain.9\n\nInfections, Inflammation, Radiation, and Drugs\nIn this patient, infectious and rheumatologic causes of small-vessel cerebral arteriopathy are unlikely owing to the absence of fever, consti- tutional symptoms, skin lesions, and signs of meningeal irritation. Nevertheless, CSF analy- sis and additional studies would be needed to rule out these conditions. Arteriopathy in- duced by radiation or drugs can be ruled out because the patient had no history of exposure to radiation or use of vasoconstrictive drugs. Although he had smoked marijuana, this drug has only weak vasoconstrictive properties and would be unlikely to cause recurrent multifo- cal infarcts.10\n\nMonogenic Conditions\nCould this patient have a genetic arteriopathy? Patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arte- riopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoen- cephalopathy (CADASIL),  which  is  caused  by a NOTCH3 mutation on chromosome 19p, can have mood disturbances, migraines, and small- vessel strokes.11 The expected MRI findings are small infarcts and white-matter changes  affect-  ing the external capsule and anterior temporal lobe. Patients with retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic man- ifestations (RVCL-S), which is caused by a TREX1 mutation, can have vision symptoms, retinal and small cerebral infarcts, and mild  liver  and  kid- ney dysfunction.12 CADASIL, RCVL-S, and other genetic arteriopathies are rare, collectively  caus- ing less than 1% of all strokes. In addition, symptoms typically develop when the patient is 25 to 50 years age, and disease progression is much slower than that observed in this pa- tient.13 Therefore, monogenic arteriopathy is unlikely.\n\nPrimary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System\nThis patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), a rare vasculitis that is restricted to the small and medium arteries and veins of the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges.14-16 PACNS is most likely to occur in patients 40 to 60 years of age. It occurs twice as frequently in men as in women. The acute-to-subacute encephalopathy and multifocal neurologic deficits that were ob- served in this patient are consistent with the diagnosis of PACNS. Headache was not reported by this patient but is also common.\nThe multifocal punctate infarcts that were seen on this patient\u2019s MRI are typical of PACNS. Other potential MRI findings include diffuse bihemispheric white-matter hyperintensities, leptomeningeal enhancement, and mass lesions that mimic tumors.17 CSF analysis reveals an ele- vated protein level and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Cerebral angiography, when positive, reveals multifocal nonconcentric arterial irregularities, usually in the distal branches. However, the sen- sitivity of cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of PACNS is only 10 to 20% because PACNS predominantly affects small-caliber arteries, which cannot be visualized. Intracranial vesselwall MRI may show concentric wall thickening and contrast enhancement, features that may distinguish PACNS from other inflammatory as well as noninflammatory arteriopathies. How- ever, brain biopsy is needed for the definitive diagnosis of PACNS.18\nThe clinical course of PACNS is typically progressive.19 Treatment strategies include in- duction therapy with glucocorticoids and intra- venous cyclophosphamide, followed by mainte- nance therapy with immunomodulatory agents such as oral cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, or metho- trexate. An important mimic of PACNS is in- travascular lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS); CSF analysis for malignant cells and brain biopsy are needed to rule out this entity.\n\nParaneoplastic Vasculitis\nAlthough PACNS is a possibility in this case, the findings on imaging of the chest and abdomen were indicative of probable cancer. Lung, gastro- intestinal, and other cancers are identified in up to 10% of patients with stroke, and stroke is the first manifestation of cancer in approximately 5% of cases.20 Common mechanisms of cancer- related stroke include hypercoagulability as well as nonbacterial (marantic) thrombotic endocar- ditis, which usually causes multifocal, widely distributed large and small infarcts.6 In rare cases, a paraneoplastic vasculitis that is similar to PACNS can result from one of the following processes: an immunologic reaction against vas- cular endothelium (molecular mimicry), endo- thelial injury due to the release of proinflamma- tory cytokines by tumor cells, or hypersensitivity to deposits of tumor protein or circulating im- mune complexes that contain tumor antigens on the vessel wall.21,22\n\nSummary\nThis patient most likely had multifocal small- vessel thrombotic strokes due to paraneoplastic cerebral vasculitis in the context of lung cancer. I suspect that, in addition to biopsy of the lung, kidney, and brain, diagnostic testing included CSF analysis and intracranial vessel-wall MRI as ad- junctive studies to assess for CNS vasculitis and to rule out diagnoses that mimic this condition.\n",

This method highlights features of the arterial and venous vessel walls, such as inflammation, wall thickening, hemorrhage,  and  calcification.  In  this patient, intracranial vessel-wall MRI (Fig. 2) revealed segmental concentric enhancement  of  the internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral arteries bilaterally, findings that possibly indi-  cated a nonspecific inflammatory  process,  such as vasculitis of undetermined cause.\n\nDr. Melanie Lang-Orsini: CSF analysis revealed a normal glucose level (50 mg per deciliter; refer- ence range, 5 to 55)  and a mildly elevated pro-  tein level (80 mg  per  deciliter;  reference  range, 50 to 75), as well  as  a  nucleated  cell count  of  31 cells (with 97% lymphocytes). Microbiologic studies were negative.\nCore-biopsy specimens of the lung mass and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 3A and 3B) showed adenocarcinoma that was composed of clusters of atypical cells with enlarged irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The tumor cells were positive for TTF1 on immunohistochemical staining; this finding is consistent with primary lung adenocarcinoma. A biopsy specimen of the kidney mass (Fig. 3C, 3D, and 3E) showed bland polygonal cells that were forming tubular struc- tures. The tumor cells were positive for PAX8;this  finding  is  consistent  with  primary renal neoplasm, rather than metastasis from the lung adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells also expressed AMACR and CD117. The morphologic features and immunophenotype were consistent with low-grade papillary renal neoplasm, which has a differential diagnosis of papillary adenoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. To distinguish between these two entities, the pathological findings would need to be correlated with the results on imaging studies. However, overall, this lowgrade lesion was unlikely to be the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n",
