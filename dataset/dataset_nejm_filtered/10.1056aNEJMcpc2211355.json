    "Primary Symptom": "A 30-Year-Old Woman with Decreased Vision and Headache",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 30-year-old woman was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of monocular vision loss. Two months before the current presentation, during the third trimester of the patient\u2019s first pregnancy, headache and decreased vision in the right eye developed. The patient thought that the headache felt like previous migraines, which had been infrequent. However, decreased vision had not been a typical feature of her mi- graines. Colors appeared dim, and light perception was decreased. There was\nsoreness in the right eye but no pain with eye movement.\nFive days later, the patient was evaluated by an optometrist. She reported that she could see only shapes and movements. On a visual field test, there was a nor- mal response in the left eye but no response in the right eye. The patient was in- structed to seek evaluation in an emergency department of another hospital.\nIn the emergency department, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which was performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material because of the pregnancy, revealed marked enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve. The nerve appeared isointense as compared with the extraocular muscles on the T1-weighted sequences but appeared bright on the T2-weighted sequence; the globes appeared normal, and the extraocular muscles were not en- larged. The results of magnetic resonance venography of the head were normal.\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital, and treatment with intravenous methyl- prednisolone was initiated for a working diagnosis of optic neuritis. During the hospitalization, her ability to see colors improved slightly, but her vision did not improve; she could see only hand motions. On the fifth hospital day, she was discharged home with instructions to schedule follow-up appointments with a neurologist and an optometrist.\nOne month after discharge from the other hospital and 2 weeks before the cur- rent presentation, the patient was again evaluated by her optometrist. The vision  in the right eye had worsened; she was no longer able to see shadows or move- ments. The patient was referred for evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist.\nOn the current presentation to the neuro- ophthalmology clinic of a hospital affiliated with this hospital, the patient reported no improve- ment in vision and ongoing soreness in the right eye. There was a history of Lyme disease, which had been diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy and had been treated with amoxi- cillin. Medications included prenatal vitamins and ferrous sulfate. The patient lived with her husband in New England and worked in health care. She had never smoked tobacco and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. A brother had  a history of childhood epilepsy, and her mother had macular degeneration.\nOn examination, the visual acuity was 20/15 in the left eye, and there was no light perception in the right eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, although the response in the right pupil was sluggish; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the right eye. On the Ishi- hara color test, all plates were identified with  the left eye. On a visual field test, there was a normal response in the left eye. The Ishihara color test and the visual field test could not be performed on the right eye because of poor vi- sion. The results of a slit-lamp examination were normal, with no cells identified in the anterior chamber or vitreous. On a funduscopic examina- tion (Fig. 1A and 1B), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had temporal pallor; there was a small area of hypopigmentation close to the macula in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and circumferential thin- ning of the ganglion cell complex of the right eye; no abnormalities were noted in the left eye.\nThe blood creatinine level was 0.56  mg per\ndeciliter (50 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]) and the blood alkaline phosphatase level 147 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). The results of other kidney-function and liver-function tests were normal, as were the blood levels of electro- lytes, the complete blood count, and the results of coagulation tests. The blood C-reactive pro- tein level was 15 mg per liter (reference value,\n<8) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 34 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20). A blood test for antinuclear antibodies was positive at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Tests for anti- bodies against aquaporin-4 and myelin oligo- dendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were negative. A\n \ndiagnosis of atypical optic neuritis was consid- ered. Because the patient was near delivery, fur- ther treatment was delayed until after the birth of her child, which occurred 3 days later.\nSix days after delivery of the baby, the patient was admitted to this hospital, and additional studies were obtained. Lumbar puncture was performed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analy- sis, there were no nucleated cells, and the levels of protein, glucose, albumin, and IgG were nor- mal. There was no oligoclonal banding after concentration of the CSF. Testing of the CSF was negative for syphilis antibodies and for antibod- ies against aquaporin-4.\nDr. Benjamin M. Kozak: MRI of the head (Fig. 2),\nperformed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prom- inent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with associated en- hancement, as well as associated hyperintensity on the T2-weighted short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. There was no evidence of as- sociated orbital edema or other orbital abnor- malities. There was a punctate hyperintense fo- cus within the left parietal subcortical white matter on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated in- version recovery sequence, without associated enhancement or restricted diffusion.\nDr. Chwalisz: Treatment with intravenous methyl-\nprednisolone and daily plasmapheresis was ad- ministered. On the fourth hospital day, the soreness in the right eye had resolved, and there was light perception in the right eye. On the fifth hospital day, treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone was changed to oral predni- sone. On the ninth hospital day, rituximab was administered, and the patient was discharged home with a prescription for a 7-week tapering course of prednisone.\nDuring the next 3 weeks, treatment with rituximab was administered weekly. Two weeks after the last rituximab infusion, the patient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic at the hospital affiliated with this hospital. She reported no eye pain and only occasional head- ache, but she noted that the vision in the right eye had worsened. Examination revealed no light perception in the right eye, with an afferent pu- pillary defect. The results of a visual field test and the Ishihara color test were unchanged from the previous evaluation in the neuro-ophthal- mology clinic. On a funduscopic examination (Fig. 1C), the optic disk in the right eye was swollen and had more pronounced temporal pal- lor; optociliary shunt vessels were also newly present. Additional imaging studies were ob- tained.\nDr. Kozak: Follow-up MRI of the head (Fig. 2)\nrevealed no radiologically significant change in the segmental enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, with persistent enhancement as well as hyperintensity on the T2-weighted STIR sequence. No new orbital abnormalities were present. In addition, the punctate lesion in the left parietal subcortical white matter was unchanged.\n\nFigure 1. Funduscopic Images.\nA funduscopic examination was performed 8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On a photograph of the right eye (Panel A), the optic disk shows pallor as compared with the optic disk of the left eye (Panel B), as well as blurred margins due to swelling (asterisks) and subtle evidence of abnormal vessels in the nasal aspect (arrow). A follow\u2011up funduscopic examination was performed 16 weeks after the onset of symptoms. On a photo\u2011 graph of the right eye (Panel C), the optic disk shows increased pallor, decreased swelling, and greater promi\u2011 nence of the abnormal vessels in the nasal aspect, a finding consistent with optociliary shunt vessels.\n\nFigure 2. MRI of the Head.\nOn admission to this hospital, approximately 9 weeks after the onset of symptoms, MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and axial contrast\u2011enhanced T1\u2011weighted sequences (Panels A and B, respectively) show prominent fusiform enlargement of a segment of the intraorbital right optic nerve with abnormal increased homogeneous enhance\u2011 ment (arrows). A coronal T2\u2011weighted short\u2011tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence (Panel C) shows diffuse hyperintensity involving this segment of the right optic nerve (arrow) without adjacent orbital edema. Approximately 2 months later, follow\u2011up MRI of the head was performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and axial contrast\u2011enhanced T1\u2011weighted se\u2011 quences (Panels D and E, respectively) show similar segmental enlargement and abnormal enhancement of the intraorbital right optic nerve (arrows). A coronal T2\u2011weighted STIR sequence (Panel F) shows similar hyperintensity involving this segment of the right optic nerve (arrow) without inflammatory changes in the orbital fat.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael Levy: This young woman presented with subacute vision loss. The first step in the evaluation of this patient is to localize the prob- lem to the eye, the optic nerve, or the brain. The patient was first evaluated by an eye specialist, who examined the eye for conditions that can lead to monocular vision loss.1 When examina- tion of the eye did not identify a cause of her vision loss, she was next evaluated for processes that affect the optic nerve or brain. This evalua- tion needed to begin quickly to avoid further damage from a potentially treatable disease.\nThe optic nerve fibers extend 50 mm  caudal-\nly from the retina to the optic chiasm. A lesion anywhere along the optic nerve can cause mon- ocular vision loss. In the optic chiasm, which is wedged between the hypothalamus of the brain above and the pituitary gland below, the optic tracts begin to segment into the right and left visual fields. Vision loss in either the right or the left visual field localizes to a lesion in the optic chiasm, the optic tracts, the optic radiations in the brain, or the visual cortex. In this patient, the examination revealed monocular vision loss\n\u2014 and not a visual field defect in both eyes. I will focus the differential diagnosis on processes that affect the optic nerve.\nOptic Neuritis\nIn a young woman, the differential diagnosis for diseases that affect the optic nerve starts with inflammatory disorders. When considering pos- sible causes of inflammatory optic neuritis, it is useful to divide the optic nerve into three seg- ments: anterior, intracanalicular, and posterior. The anterior segment of the optic nerve is  25 mm in length and extends from the retina to the entrance of the skull. This segment is com- monly the target of multiple sclerosis.2 A total of 56% of patients with multiple sclerosis have in- volvement of the optic nerve at some point in the disease course.3 The lesions are  usually  focal (i.e., not long) and located within the optic nerve itself. Optic neuritis is the initial event in 20%  of patients who present with a new diagnosis of multiple sclerosis; for this reason, the workup  for optic neuritis includes MRI of the head to look for the periventricular lesions that are typi- cal of multiple sclerosis.4 In patients with mul- tiple sclerosis, optic neuritis usually heals with-out treatment, but long-term therapy to prevent additional inflammatory attacks in the central nervous system reduces the risk of long-term disability.5 In this patient, MRI of the head did not show  lesions  that would be consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. In addition, she did not have features associated with a high risk of this diagnosis, such as a family  history;  if such features had been present, yearly MRI of the head may have been indicated. My overall suspi- cion for multiple sclerosis in this patient is low. The anterior segment of the optic nerve is also a target of monophasic optic neuritis (also called idiopathic optic neuritis). Episodes often occur after an immunologic response is triggered by infection or the administration of a vaccine. Monophasic optic neuritis is usually associated with a high likelihood of recovery and a low risk of relapse. There is no diagnostic test for mono- phasic optic neuritis, and the diagnosis is typi- cally considered when alternative causes are ruled out. Multiple sclerosis and monophasic optic neuritis together account for 95% of cases of optic neuritis; each of these diagnoses is equally likely to be the cause of optic neuritis.4 Less common causes of optic neuritis include neuro- sarcoidosis, MOG antibody disease (MOGAD), and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Neurosarcoidosis is a systemic granuloma- tous process, whereas MOGAD and NMOSD are antigen-specific autoimmune diseases that tar- get MOG and the water channel aquaporin-4, respectively. Patients with neurosarcoidosis can present with a subacute course of optic neuritis, which often develops in the context of other cranial neuropathies, because the inflammation tends to spread along the basal meninges.6 In patients with MOGAD, lesions involving the op- tic nerve tend to be long, sometimes extending across multiple segments of the optic nerve, and they cause meningeal inflammation (i.e., peri- neuritis) that leads to concomitant pain.7 In pa- tients with NMOSD, the intracanalicular and posterior segments of the optic nerve are com- mon targets of inflammation. The intracanalic- ular segment of the optic nerve is only 10 mm long, but inflammation in this part of the nerve is problematic because of the limited space for swelling within the bony canal. NMOSD lesions are among the most destructive lesions associ- ated with inflammatory diseases: optic neuritis due to NMOSD causes blindness in 60% of pa-tients despite treatment with immunosuppres- sive therapy.8\nBoth MOGAD and NMOSD are consider- ations in this patient because of the severe vision loss and the extensive swelling and enhance- ment of the optic nerve on MRI. For each of these diagnoses, serologic tests are highly spe- cific in the context of optic neuritis; the sensitiv- ity of these assays ranges from 60 to 94%.9,10 In this patient, the blood tests for antibodies against MOG and aquaporin-4 were negative. Although seronegative disease is possible, I will consider other potential explanations for this patient\u2019s vision loss.\n\nInfection\nInfectious optic neuropathies are not common in the United States. The two most likely causes in this patient are Bartonella henselae and Toxo- plasma gondii. When these organisms affect the optic nerve, inflammation of the retina typically also occurs, and this finding is readily identified on funduscopy. In this patient, funduscopy showed signs of venous congestion of the optic nerve but no evidence of infection.11\n\nTumor\nMRI in this patient revealed a lesion in the optic nerve that had a masslike appearance and did not decrease in size despite the administration  of intravenous methylprednisolone. The presence of persistent or treatment-refractory optic neuri- tis is suggestive of NMOSD or sarcoid optic neuropathy. However, the presence of a persistent mass lesion of the optic nerve can be indicative of a tumor, most commonly an optic nerve glioma or an optic nerve sheath meningioma.\nOptic nerve gliomas arise from astrocytes and form low-grade masses similar to pilocytic astrocytomas of the inferior fossa.12 More than 90% of optic nerve gliomas occur in persons younger than 20 years of age.13 In this case, the lesion seen on MRI had the classic appearance of an optic nerve glioma, but the patient was  30 years of age.\nOptic nerve sheath meningiomas arise from the meningeal tissue around the optic nerve fi- bers and typically compromise vision by com- pressing the optic nerve over time.14 Because optic nerve sheath meningiomas do not typically affect optic nerve tissue, MRI may show a char- acteristic \u201ctram-track\u201d sign, a pattern caused by simultaneous enhancement of tumor tissue and nonenhancement of the optic nerve.15 Although the tram-track sign was not observed on MRI in this patient, optic nerve sheath  meningiomas are more likely to occur in adults than optic nerve gliomas. For both of these tumors, the diagnosis can be made by means of biopsy, and treatment involves surgical resection or radia- tion therapy. Surgery is associated with a high risk of blindness in the affected eye.\nBiopsy of the optic nerve sheath is rarely per formed in the workup for optic neuropathies because of the risk of permanent vision damage. However, in this patient, the poor response to immunosuppressive therapy and the persistent enhancement  and  masslike  appearance  of  the lesion on MRI make a biopsy necessary for diag- nosis. I suspect that the diagnostic test in this patient was a biopsy of the right optic nerve sheath.\n",

Biopsy Specimen of the Optic Nerve Sheath.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining shows fragments of an eosinophilic tumor admixed with orbital fat and bone (Panel A, arrow). At higher magnification, the tumor architecture is predominantly nested or whorled (Panel B, circled); this growth pattern is characteristic of meningothelial meningioma. The cells have indistinct cell borders and monoto\u2011 nous, banal, round\u2011to\u2011oval nuclei with occasional nuclear pseudoinclusions (Panel C and inset, arrows). There is no evidence of atypical features, such as necrosis, mitotic Figures, or glial invasion (Panel D). On immunohistochemical staining for progesterone receptor, there is diffuse nuclear positivity (Panel E, in brown). On immunohistochemical staining for Ki\u201167, the proliferation index is very low, with positive cells constituting less than 1% of the cells counted (Panel F, in red).\n",
