    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Madhukar S. Patel (Surgery): A 41-year-old pregnant woman was seen in the emer- gency department of this hospital at 36 weeks 3 days of gestation because of ab- dominal pain.\nSix and a half months before this evaluation, when the patient was at her initial routine prenatal visit, transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a normal intrauterine gestational sac and embryo. The date of the last menstrual period was unknown, and ultrasonographic measurements were used to determine the estimated due date. Thereafter, prenatal follow-up was uneventful.\nFifteen hours before the current evaluation, abdominal pain developed suddenly after the patient had eaten breakfast. The pain was in the right lower quadrant and was described as sharp and constant. She rated the pain at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain; she noted that the pain was more severe than it had been during her two previous vaginal deliveries, which had occurred without epidural anesthesia. She had no fever, chills, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, or contractions, and fetal movement was normal. The patient took oral docusate, which did not relieve the pain, and then took acetaminophen, after which the pain decreased slightly. She called her obstetrician, who recom- mended that she present to the clinic for evaluation.\nIn the obstetrics clinic, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography were performed. The fetus was in cephalic presentation, with a biophysical profile score of 8/8 (indicating normal fetal well-being) and a fetal heart rate of 134 beats per minute. The placenta was positioned anteriorly, the cervical length was 21 mm, and the umbilical artery appeared normal on Doppler examination. The patient was referred to the emergency department of a local hospital for further evaluation and arrived approximately 7 hours after the onset of symptoms.\nIn the emergency department of the other hospital, the patient reported that the abdominal pain persisted and that nausea had developed. Her surgical history consisted of breast augmentation surgery and extraction of wisdom teeth in the distant past. She was gravida 4, 2-0-1-2. Her first and third pregnancies had been uncomplicated and had resulted in vaginal deliveries at full term; the second pregnancy had ended in a spontane- ous abortion. She was immune to varicella and rubella; tests performed during this pregnancy for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, human immunodeficiency virus, and group B streptococcus had been nega- tive. The patient was taking prenatal vitamins and was allergic to iodine-containing contrast material, which had caused anaphylaxis. She lived with her husband and two children in a subur- ban neighborhood in New England. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her father had died of liver disease associated with alcohol use disorder; her mother had had cervical cancer and hypertension and had died of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/67 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdomen was gravid and soft, with hyperactive bowel sounds; on palpation, there was severe tenderness in the right lower quadrant that ex- tended inferiorly to the inguinal region, with voluntary guarding and without rebound tender- ness. Rovsing\u2019s sign (pain in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower quad- rant) was present. A limited pelvic examination revealed that the cervix was closed, and the re- mainder of the examination was normal. Urinaly- sis showed cloudy, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.002, moderate ketones, and few bac- teria. The blood type was O, Rh-positive; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAcetaminophen and ondansetron were administered orally and normal saline intravenously. An imaging study was obtained; after the results were available, ampicillin\u2013sulbactam and clinda- mycin were administered intravenously, and the patient was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department of this hospital for further treatment.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Noelle N. Saillant: I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. This 41-year-old woman presented at 36 weeks 3 days of gestation with abdominal pain. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of abdominal pain during pregnancy can be com- plicated because maternal adaptations lead to an insidious presentation of intraabdominal disor- ders. For example, in pregnant patients, the typi- cal findings associated with peritoneal irritation, such as rebound and guarding, may be delayed by uterine growth and increased abdominal muscular laxity that is mediated by progesterone and relaxin. Furthermore, some laboratory find- ings that would usually be suggestive of an abdominal emergency, such as leukocytosis with a neutrophil shift and a low blood bicarbonate level indicative of metabolic acidosis, would be considered normal in pregnant patients. Finally, early sepsis and hypovolemia may be difficult to detect in pregnant patients, because such signs are obscured by the increase in maternal cardiac output (from 4 liters to 6 liters) and robust plasma volume expansion (from 1500 ml to 2000 ml) during gestation. These adaptive changes lead to the late manifestation of tachycardia or hypoten- sion.1 Therefore, it is not surprising that this patient had a normal heart rate and was hemo- dynamically stable.\nIn a study involving pregnant patients who\npresented with abdominal pain, the percentage of women who had nonspecific abdominal pain was nearly equal to the percentage who had an operative condition (38% and 41%, respectively).2 Differentiating between an intraabdominal emer- gency and a more benign condition requires fo- cus on the intraabdominal pathological features combined with consideration of a broad list of possible causes related and unrelated to obstet- rics and gynecology.\nIntraabdominal Disorders\nAppendicitis and biliary complications are the most common indications for operative inter- vention during pregnancy and therefore would be highest on the differential diagnosis. The fre- quency of appendicitis is the same among preg- nant patients as in the general adult population (1 per 500 to 1000 persons). The risk of biliary complications is higher among pregnant patients than in the general population because of the decreased gallbladder ejection fraction and in- creased stone formation during pregnancy.\nThis patient\u2019s examination revealed pain in the right lower quadrant, which is found in 85% of pregnant patients with appendicitis, and did not reveal any hernias as a source of obstruction and abdominal pain.3 In addition, she had had no sick contacts or known exposures to raw or undercooked foods that would suggest infec- tions that mimic appendicitis, such as Yersinia enterocolitica infection. She had no history of in- flammatory bowel disease or diverticular disease and had not undergone many surgeries, so bowel obstruction is unlikely. Furthermore, she had no signs of preeclampsia, and thus hepatic capsular swelling would be an unlikely cause of her abdominal pain.4 The laboratory test results were not suggestive of hepatitis or pancreatitis, and the elevated alkaline phosphatase level was probably due to placental production. Urinalysis and ultrasonography would have shown any evi- dence of ureteral compression from the growing uterus or of urinary tract infection or pyelonephri- tis.5 Other, rare complications to consider in- clude intussusception, volvulus, internal hernia, peptic ulcer disease, and visceral artery aneu- rysm. Finally, consideration of intimate partner violence should prompt a confidential, safe dis- cussion with the patient, if appropriate.\nGiven this patient\u2019s history, laboratory test\nresults, and findings on physical examination, appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. To establish the diagnosis, I would per- form abdominal ultrasonography, and if the study is inconclusive, I would perform magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI).\n",
