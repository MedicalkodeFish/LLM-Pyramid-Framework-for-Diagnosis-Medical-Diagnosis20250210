    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Luke A. Stevens (Emergency Medicine): A 38-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of altered mental status and a seizure.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until the night before the cur- rent evaluation. His wife reported that he fell out of bed at approximately 4 a.m. and was on the floor \u201cshaking.\u201d He appeared confused and was \u201cspeaking gibber- ish.\u201d Police were called to the patient\u2019s apartment, and emergency medical services were activated. On evaluation at the patient\u2019s home, a fingerstick blood glucose measurement was 110 mg per deciliter (6.1 mmol per liter). The patient was com- bative and disoriented, and he actively resisted being placed in the ambulance. On arrival at the emergency department, he had a witnessed generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, lasting 2 minutes, for which lorazepam was administered intravenously.\nA limited history was obtained from the patient\u2019s wife, brother, and sister-in-law. The patient had not been ill recently and had no history of seizures or cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or neurologic disorders. His medical his- tory was notable for a laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient took no medica- tions and had no known adverse reactions to medications. He worked in environ- mental maintenance at a local business. He lived with his wife, daughter, and son. He had immigrated to Boston from a rural area of Guatemala approximately 20 years earlier. He rarely drank alcohol and did not use tobacco or illicit drugs. There was no known family history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disease.\nThe temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 171/90 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxy- gen saturation 95% while the patient was using a nonrebreather mask. His eyes were open, and an involuntary upward gaze was noted; the pupils were 4 mm, symmetric, and reactive to light. He did not verbally respond to questions or follow commands. Gag and cough reflexes were normal. He withdrew his arms and legs in response to pain, and a jerking motion of the head was noted. The score on the Glasgow Coma Scale was 6 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness). The neck was supple. Peripheral reflexes were normal. The toes were downgoing bilaterally.\nScant blood was observed in the mouth, without visible lacerations. The remainder of the exami- nation was normal.\nBlood levels of albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013 B-type natriuretic peptide, and troponin T were normal, as were the prothrombin time, partial- thromboplastin time, and results of liver-func- tion tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A blood specimen was obtained to test for strongyloides antibodies. An electrocar- diogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 114 beats per minute but was otherwise normal. Seven minutes after the first dose, a second dose of lorazepam was administered intravenous- ly for suspected continued seizure activity. The patient remained confused and agitated, and an endotracheal tube was placed for airway protec- tion. A chest radiograph was normal, with the endotracheal tube in an appropriate position.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Andrew J. Cole: This previously healthy 38-year- old man presented to the emergency department with confusion and possible seizure activity. I will discuss my general approach to evaluating a patient with an apparent first seizure, and then I will develop a differential diagnosis for this patient.\n\nEvaluation of First Seizure\nFrom the neurologist\u2019s perspective, the first ques- tion to ask when evaluating a patient referred for an apparent first seizure is always, \u201cWas the event a seizure?\u201d In this case, the initial event, in which the wife found the patient confused, does not help to determine whether he had a seizure. The second event was witnessed by medical professionals and described as a gener- alized convulsion; the patient also had blood in his mouth, presumably from biting his tongue.\nThe second question is, \u201cWhat is the cause of the seizure activity?\u201d Identifying a cause not only helps the patient to understand the illness but also helps the neurologist to estimate the likeli- hood of recurrence. The cause ties directly into the third question, \u201cWhat is the most appropri- ate treatment?\u201d The neurologist must decide whether antiseizure treatment is required and whether there is a need to initiate long-term therapy.\n\nPatient Assessment\nAmong patients presenting with an apparent first seizure, a detailed assessment results in confir- mation of a first seizure in one third of cases. In another one third of cases, diagnostic testing confirms seizure activity but also identifies evi- dence of a previous seizure. Finally, in the re- maining one third of cases, no seizure activity is identified.\nFor all these patients, obtaining the clinical history is key. The most powerful tool in the evaluation of a possible seizure is additional in- formation. Speaking to a witness may reveal critical details that define the chronology of the disease process and indicate whether the seizure was provoked, which is the case in approximately 70% of patients with a first seizure. Emergency medicine providers are in a great position to interview family members and friends in order to find f leeting but critical details, such as whether there was a change in the patient\u2019s be- havior, health, sleep, alcohol or substance use, or routines that could be a provoking factor; whether there were any warning signs; and whether the patient\u2019s seizure was focal at the onset. The history may also reveal whether the first seizure was missed. A typical scenario is that the early seizures manifest as partial seizure events with alterations of consciousness and unusual behavior, and it is the generalized con- vulsion that brings the patient to medical atten- tion and illuminates the diagnosis.\nFor this patient, a history was obtained from family members. On the day before presentation to the emergency department, he had been tak- ing care of his children and had eaten dinner with his brother; there was no report of unusual or altered behavior at dinner. Furthermore, there was no history of recent sleep deprivation. With regard to potential medications that can provoke seizure, we ask whether the patient had discon- tinued long-term benzodiazepine therapy or taken proconvulsant medications, such as tramadol or bupropion. This patient had been taking no pre- scribed or over-the-counter medications.\nA neurologic examination can help to assess for brain dysfunction, whether focal or general- ized, and to identify any previously unrecognized conditions. This patient had no physical findings that were suggestive of an underlying disease.\n\nLaboratory Testing\nIn addition to history taking and neurologic ex- amination, targeted laboratory testing, cerebral imaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) can inform the diagnostic evaluation of a potential first seizure. In this patient, the laboratory evalu- ation ruled out hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, and liver dysfunction. A complete blood count with differential count can provide evidence of infection, although leukocytosis associated with demargination (which was seen in this patient) is not uncommon in the postictal period. The patient\u2019s urine and serum toxicology panels were negative. An elevated lactic acid level is consis- tent with prolonged muscle activity characteris- tic of a tonic\u2013clonic seizure, and it is more suggestive of seizure than of a condition that mimics seizure. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is reserved for specific situations that are highly suggestive of a viral or bacterial infection involv- ing the central nervous system (CNS).\n\nCerebral Imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and com- puted tomography (CT) of the head can be used to evaluate patients with seizures. In general, MRI is the preferred technique, because it has higher sensitivity and specificity than CT for the detection of brain parenchymal lesions.4 In the emergency department, specific MRI protocols for seizure evaluation, stratified according to age group, can be used to determine the most likely associated abnormalities. Nonetheless, CT is com- monly used in the emergency department, be- cause it can rule out acute hemorrhage, masses, and calcified lesions more rapidly than MRI. It is likely that this patient underwent CT after arrival and stabilization in the emergency department, but if the CT study was negative, MRI would ultimately help us to carefully assess for a caus- ative anatomical abnormality.\n\nElectroencephalography\nEEG is extremely useful in classifying the sei- zure problem, characterizing the seizure as focal or generalized, and identifying the location in the brain from which it arises.4 An interictal EEG is abnormal in up to 60% of patients with epilepsy, and sleep deprivation and sleep recordings in- crease the yield of informative results. EEG can also be used to identify whether the patient is still seizing (if consciousness is slow to be re- gained) and to assess the risk of recurrence. Findings on EEG may help physicians to deter- mine whether some patients need benzodiaze- pine, sedation, and airway protection. In addition, the findings may help physicians to appropri- ately adjust the dose of benzodiazepine so that oversedation does not occur. More than 90% of seizures end spontaneously in 2 to 3 minutes.5 It would be informative to review an EEG obtained immediately after the patient received the first dose of lorazepam, to assess whether epileptic activity was suppressed and whether there was ongoing seizure activity. However, EEG is rarely, if ever, performed rapidly in the emergency de- partment.\nDifferential Diagnosis of First Seizure in This Patient\nThere is no evidence of a provoked event in this patient\u2019s history or examination; he had appeared well the day before the seizure. In addition, there is no evidence of a previous neurologic, medical, or psychiatric condition that would have put him at increased risk for seizures. It appears that this 38-year-old man had been healthy.\n \n\nHowever, he had emigrated from a rural area of Guatemala, and therefore, we need to consider endemic infectious diseases that could have in- creased this patient\u2019s risk for seizures even years after exposure, such as a parasitic brain infection.\n\nCysticercosis\nCysticercosis is the most common cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The disease results from ingestion of eggs from the tapeworm Tae- nia solium. At first, the disease is relatively indo- lent, because the eggs form cysts that do not generate a clinically significant immune re- sponse for approximately 5 years. In the 1930s, MacArthur and Dixon observed the disease pro- cess in former soldiers who had returned to England after serving in India.6,7 They noted that seizures associated with cysticercosis often emerged years after the initial exposure, along- side an inflammatory response associated with late calcification of the parasitic lesion. This disease is endemic in areas of Asia and Central America8; in these areas, 10 to 50% of patients with epilepsy have evidence of neurocysticerco- sis on cerebral imaging. There are also locations in the United States where cysticercosis is highly prevalent, including Southern California, Texas, and New York City.\n\nToxoplasmosis\nToxoplasmosis is another parasitic disease that can cause seizures in a person who appears to be otherwise healthy. The disease is distributed worldwide, with a prevalence of up to 80% in certain Central American and South American countries. Patients with toxoplasmic encephali- tis present with fever, headache, confusion, and seizures; imaging studies may reveal multiple ring-enhancing lesions with edema. However, such manifestations are rare in immunocompe- tent persons. To our knowledge, this patient had no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Furthermore, he had a negative HIV screening test and had no evidence of leukope- nia, lymphopenia, or hepatic or renal dysfunc- tion; these findings make reactivation of toxo- plasmosis unlikely.\n\nCancer\nCancer is another possible cause of a first sei- zure in adults. In particular, patients with low- grade brain tumors frequently present with focal seizures in the absence of focal signs and symp- toms preceding the event. In this case, imaging studies would be needed to assess for and rule out a tumor, because there is no evidence in the history or examination results that would fully rule out this possibility.\nA cryptogenic, genetic, or idiopathic general- ized epilepsy syndrome should be considered. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndrome usually occurs with a stressor such as fever or sleep de- privation. These syndromes are not particularly likely in a 38-year-old person, but EEG would be informative.\n\nConditions That Mimic Seizures\nWe must always be mindful of conditions that mimic seizures and consider the possibility that the presenting event was not really a seizure. However, in this patient, a tonic\u2013clonic seizure was witnessed, so the epileptic nature of the event seems clear. Cerebrovascular accidents and transient ischemic attacks sometimes mimic seizures, but this patient had no evidence of focal brain dysfunction and his event included positive signs rather than evidence of loss of function. Intoxications, syncope, migraine, be- havioral dysregulation, and psychiatric events represent diagnostic challenges. Again, toxicol- ogy panels were negative in this patient. Further neuropsychiatric interviewing and examination would help to rule out the other possibilities.\n\nOn the basis of the features of the patient\u2019s presentation, the fact that he had been healthy the day before the seizure, and his history of living in a rural area of Guatemala, neurocysti- cercosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. To establish this diagnosis, CT was most likely performed, followed by MRI and EEG.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Michael H. Lev: In the emergency department, the patient underwent CT of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous con- trast material. The CT study was notable for the presence of several coarse intraparenchymal calcifications, the largest of which was located in the anteromedial right frontal lobe (Fig. 1), with mild surrounding hypodensity that was suggestive of vasogenic edema. These findings are typical of neurocysticercosis. Other calcified lesions, such as chronic granulomatous disease and oligodendroglioma, can have a similar ap- pearance but are unlikely in this case.\nIn the emergency department, the patient also\nunderwent MRI of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, for further characterization of the findings noted on CT. The MRI study showed focal enhancing lesions in the right frontal lobe, left occipital lobe, and right temporal lobe that corresponded to the coarse calcifications seen on CT. The right frontal lesion was associated with ring enhance- ment with a possible central punctate focus on T1-weighted imaging (Fig. 2A), mild surround- ing hyperintensity on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging (Fig. 2B), and susceptibility effect on gradient\u2013echo imaging (Fig. 2C). This constellation of CT and MRI findings strongly suggests a diagnosis of neurocysticercosis. Other lesions such as those caused by tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and cancer are unlikely. Neuro- cysticercosis can be present in intraparenchymal, intraventricular, meningeal, spinal, and ocular locations. The forms can be active (viable cysts with scolex, rarely associated with symptomatic disease), transitional (degenerating cysts in the colloidal and necrotic stages with adjacent ede- ma, commonly associated with seizures), or in- active (calcifications or meningeal fibrosis).9\n\nFigure 1.
