    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Vivian De Oliveira Rodrigues Gama (Medicine): A 31-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of perianal and penile ulcers, rectal pain, and vesiculopustu-      lar rash.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 9 days before this admis- sion, when he noticed several itchy white \u201cbumps\u201d around the anus that subse- quently evolved into ulcerative lesions. The next day, he sought evaluation at a primary care clinic of another hospital. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. An injection of penicil- lin G benzathine was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir was started.\nDuring the next 5 days, the perianal ulcers did not abate, and the patient stopped taking valacyclovir. Painful proctitis with rectal bleeding and malodorous, mucopurulent discharge developed, along with fever, chills, drenching sweats, and new tender swelling in the groin. Three days before this admission, a new painless ulcer appeared on the penis that was similar in appearance to the perianal ulcers. Two days before this admission, new scattered vesicular lesions appeared on the arms and legs, and the patient presented to the infectious disease clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient. Fourteen years before this evaluation, sore throat and upper body rash developed; he received a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and was treated with penicillin G benzathine. He also had a history of recurrent oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, for which he was treated intermittently with valacyclovir. He took daily oral emtricitabine and teno- fovir for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient lived in a suburban area of Massachusetts with two roommates and a cat. Two weeks before this evaluation, he had traveled to an urban area of south- eastern Canada. During this trip, he had had sex with male partners without the use of barrier protection. There was no other recent travel. The patient did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol rarely.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 75 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient  air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.9. There were six tender perianal ulcers, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. There was also one ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measur- ing 7 mm in diameter, with  raised  borders  (Fig. 1). Painful bilateral inguinal lymphadenopa- thy was present. The perianal skin was weeping, and there was proctitis with severe tenderness that precluded digital rectal examination. In ad- dition, there were approximately 12 papulovesicu- lar lesions scattered across the chest, back, arms, and legs. The lesions measured 2 mm in diam- eter, were filled with clear fluid, and had sur- rounding erythema (Fig. 2A and 2B).\nBlood  levels of electrolytes and glucose were\nnormal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. A blood test for trepo- nemal antibodies was positive; a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1. A blood test for HIV was nonreactive, and tests of urine and rectal specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic ac- ids were negative. A test of a specimen obtained from a perianal ulcer for HSV nucleic acids was performed, and a blood sample was obtained for bacterial culture. An injection of ceftriaxone was administered, and treatment with valacyclovir and doxycycline was started.\nDuring the next 2 days, the ulcers did not abate and the rectal pain worsened, such that the patient was not able to sit, sleep, or have bowel movements. Additional skin lesions ap- peared. The patient returned to the infectious disease clinic for evaluation. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shal- low ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis (Fig. 3). The patient was admitted to this hospital.\nOn examination, the patient appeared un- comfortable because of rectal pain. Skin lesions that had become pustular with an erythematous base were scattered across the scalp, chest, back, legs, and arms, including one on the palm (Fig. 2C). There were no lesions in the mouth. Multiple tender, enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, measuring more than 1 cm in diameter, were present. The perianal and penile ulcers were tender and had heaped margins around a central dry base. The complete blood count and the white-cell differential count were normal. Swabs from a perianal ulcer and a chest skin lesion were obtained for bacterial culture.\nTreatment with intravenous acyclovir was started, and doxycycline was continued; stool softeners and hydromorphone were adminis- tered. A blood test for HIV type 1 RNA was performed.\n\nFigure 1. Photographs of Perianal and Penile Ulcers from 2 Days before Admission.\nPanel A shows a tender perianal ulcer, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter, with raised, firm margins. Panel B shows an ulcer on the dorsum of the penile shaft, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that is similar in appearance to the peri\u2011 anal ulcer. Panel C shows that the ulcer has heaped margins around a central dry base. In all panels, the patient\u2019s hands are shown.\nFigure 2. Photographs of the Rash.\nPanels A and B show scattered papulovesicular lesions on the chest that were present 2 days before admission. The lesions measure 2 mm in diameter, are filled with clear fluid, and have surrounding erythema. Panel C shows a lesion on the right palm that was present at the time of admission. Panel D shows a papulovesicular lesion on the left sec\u2011 ond finger, which was one of the last skin lesions to develop, approximately 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms.\nFigure 3. Photograph from Anoscopic Examination.\nA photograph obtained during anoscopy, performed on the day of admission, shows intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, findings consistent with proctitis.and progression of disseminated papulovesicular and papulopustular skin lesions. On the basis of the timing of his presentation, his illness was best described as subacute, although the daily progression of symptoms was rapid enough to prompt admission. At the time of admission, symptoms had been present for more than a week, so many hyperacute infections could be ruled out.\n\nThe patient\u2019s only recent travel had been to Canada. His status as a man who has sex with men and his history of syphilis placed him at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as well as other infections that are trans- mitted through close contact. He had no known sick contacts or contacts with similar symptoms, at least initially. There were two important anti- microbial exposures. He took daily emtricitabine and tenofovir for HIV PrEP, which dramatically reduces the risk of acquiring HIV. He also took oral valacyclovir several times per year for out- breaks of oral HSV infection. He was not known to have any systemic, anatomical, or functional alterations that would increase his risk of infec- tion; specifically, he did not have any conditions or receive any treatments that would suppress the immune system, and he did not have a chronic medical illness such as liver disease, kidney dis- ease, or diabetes.\nDuring the patient\u2019s two outpatient visits at this hospital, a broad differential diagnosis was considered and extensive testing was performed. Initial treatments included penicillin G benza- thine, ceftriaxone, and oral valacyclovir and doxycycline. When his symptoms continued to worsen despite these treatments, he was admit- ted to the hospital. Laboratory test results were normal.:\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Nesli Basgoz: This 31-year-old man was admitted to the  hospi-\ntal with an illness that began with rash, with anogenital and cutaneous lesions, followed by regional  lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms. \nBacterial Infections\nGonorrhea\nGonorrhea is an STI caused by N. gonorrhoeae. It is a common cause of urethritis in men and cer- vicitis in women. Although genital and extra- genital gonorrhea can be asymptomatic, proctitis can occur, making the infection indistinguish- able from other STIs. Disseminated gonococcal infection is reported in 1 to 3% of patients with gonorrhea. Case series highlight two different forms of disseminated gonococcal infection \u2014 purulent monoarthritis or oligoarthritis and a syndrome of dermatitis, tenosynovitis, and mi- gratory polyarthralgias \u2014 but the clinical spec- trum is heterogeneous. Cutaneous findings are reported in 50 to 75% of patients with bactere- mia. The skin lesions may resemble the vesicu- lopustular lesions seen in this patient. However, patients with disseminated gonococcal infection do not commonly have signs and symptoms of a localized gonococcal infection (e.g., proctitis) at the time of diagnosis, and perianal and penile ulcers would not be explained by gonorrhea.\nSyphilis\nSyphilis is an infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. The average incubation period is 2 to 3 weeks, although symptoms have been reported only 3 days after exposure. The primary lesion, or chancre, is typically an ulcer measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter with an indurated margin. Penile lesions are common; perianal lesions can also be seen. Chancres are usually painless but may be associated with pain in some cases. The presence of multiple chancres is uncommon. The secondary stage of syphilis, known as secondary syphilis, is associated with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy (which is typically more generalized than the lymphade- nopathy observed in this patient), as well as rash and a positive RPR test. The rash can be pustu- lar. Involvement of the palms and soles is a com- mon feature. However, extensive painful peri- anal disease and proctitis would not be explained by syphilis.\n\nLymphogranuloma Venereum\nC. trachomatis is the most common bacterial cause of sexually transmitted genital infection in the United States. Lymphogranuloma venereum is a disease caused by the L1, L2, and L3 serovars of\nC. trachomatis. Lymphogranuloma venereum can lead to proctitis or proctocolitis, and outbreaks among men who have sex with men have been reported in the United States. The primary lesion is a genital or anal ulcer that develops 3 to 12 days after exposure and is often asymptomatic. The secondary stage of lymphogranuloma vene- reum is characterized by involvement of regional lymph nodes. The groove sign (which indicates involvement of both the inguinal nodes and the femoral nodes just below them) and inguinal buboes (which may suppurate and drain) may be present but are not universal features. The sec- ondary stage is often associated with systemic symptoms. Persistent perianal and penile ulcers and disseminated skin lesions have not been described with this illness.\n\nChancroid\nChancroid is an infection caused by the bacteri- um Haemophilus ducreyi, which is an uncommon cause of genital ulcer disease and lymphade- nopathy in the United States. Chancroid is as- sociated with the development of one or more deep, painful genital or perianal ulcers and with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. Proctitis has not been attributed to this infection alone, and disseminated skin lesions have not been described.",
