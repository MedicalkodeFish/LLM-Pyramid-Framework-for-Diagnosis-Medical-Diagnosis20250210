    "Primary Symptom": "An 8-Week-Old Male Infant with Inconsolable Crying and Weakness",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jeffrey M. Sumner (Pediatrics): An 8-week-old male infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of inconsolable crying, lethargy, weakness, and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been well until 7 days before the current presentation, when irritability and frequent crying developed. One day before the current presentation, the episodes of crying increased in duration, and the patient\u2019s grandmother no- ticed that he cried more intensely when the right side of his abdomen was touched. The patient was evaluated at the pediatric primary care clinic of another hospital. The vital signs and physical examination were reportedly normal, and a diagnosis of discomfort due to gastrointestinal gas was considered.\nAfter the patient returned home, he had a crying episode that lasted for mul- tiple hours while he was awake; the crying stopped while he was fully asleep. After he woke up, the crying continued for 8 hours and became weaker. During breast-feeding, the patient fed less vigorously than usual, and the latch onto the nipple was weaker. That night, the crying continued, and the patient became in- consolable. He had frantic movements of the arms and legs and slept only 1 hour. On the day of the current presentation, the inconsolable crying continued. The patient did not latch onto the nipple, and his mother expressed breast milk di- rectly into his mouth. A family member called the pediatric primary care clinic and was instructed to bring the patient to the emergency department of this hos- pital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, additional history was obtained from the pa- tient\u2019s family members. There had been no change in the frequency of wet diapers; the last bowel movement had occurred 2 days before this presentation. The patient had been born at a gestational age of 39 weeks 1 day by a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery after a normal pregnancy. The birth weight had been 4.5 kg (98th percentile), the length 54.6 cm (99th percentile), and the head circumference\n36.5 cm (94th percentile). The patient had met normal developmental milestones. He had not yet received the routine immunizations recommended for 2-month-old infants. Medications included vitamin D supplements; there were no known medication allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with his grandmother, who pri- marily cared for him, as well as his mother, fa- ther, and sister. His mother had depression, anxi- ety, and anemia. His father and sister were healthy. On examination, the axillary temperature was 37.2\u00b0C,  the  blood  pressure  100/76  mm  Hg,  the heart rate 153 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 34 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 97% while the patient was breathing am- bient air. The weight was 7.1 kg (99th percentile), the height 62.5 cm (>99th percentile), and the head circumference 41.5 cm (99th percentile). The patient was alert but irritable. He cried weakly and could not be soothed. The anterior fontanelle was open, soft, and flat. The mucous membranes were moist. The heart rate was tachycardic and regular. The lungs were clear on auscultation. The abdomen was soft, with no hepatosplenomegaly. The results of the testicular examination were nor-\nmal. There was no rash.\nThe blood levels of glucose, lactic acid, lipase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotrans- ferase, and bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The platelet count was 621,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000); the remainder of the com- plete blood count and differential count was normal. The results of urinalysis and urine toxi- cology screening were normal. Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influ- enza A and B viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture. Radiography of the chest and abdomen and ultrasonography of the abdomen showed no abnormalities.\nWhile the patient was in the emergency de-\npartment, he remained irritable and did not at- tain a calm awake state. He was admitted to this hospital. Four hours after presentation, lethargy developed. Additional testing was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head showed no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was per- formed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The CSF glucose level was 54 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the CSF protein level was 104 mg per deciliter (refer- ence range, 5 to 55); there were 1055 red cells per microliter and 2 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 70% were lymphocytes. A diagnosis of meningitis was considered. Empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclo- vir was started.\nSix hours after presentation, increased work of breathing developed, and the oxygen saturation decreased to 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Supplemental oxygen was adminis- tered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 100%. The patient was transferred to the PICU. Dr. Sarah A. Murphy: On arrival at the PICU, the patient was difficult to arouse. He had grunting respirations, head-bobbing, intercostal retractions, and an exaggerated abdominal breathing pattern. With vigorous stimulation, the patient had a weak hypophonic cry, gurgling, and stertor on inspi- ration. Ptosis was present in both eyes. When the eyes were opened by the examiner, the pupils were equal, round, and reactive. The face appeared symmetric and placid. There were few spontane- ous movements of the arms, and the patient did not move his arms against gravity. There was no spontaneous movement of the legs, and diffuse hypotonia was present. Muscle bulk was normal and symmetric. Reflexes were decreased but preserved.\nTracheal intubation was performed, and me- chanical ventilation was initiated. Tachycardia and hypertension persisted despite the adminis- tration of boluses of sedative and analgesic agents and the initiation of continuous infusions of opioids and benzodiazepines.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sharon A. Chung: This 82-year-old woman pre- sented with a subacute process that was charac- terized by fatigue and loss of appetite, cognitive decline that was attributed to delirium, and se- vere pain resulting in weakness and an inability to walk without assistance. The strength exami- nation was limited by pain, but decreased plan- tar f lexion and dorsiflexion of both feet were noted; she also had pain with light touch on sensory examination. There was decreased range of motion in her shoulders and elbows, and sy- novitis was present in the small joints of her hands and feet. The most notable findings on diagnostic testing were the abnormalities on nerve conduction testing.\nNerve Conduction Studies\nDecreased amplitude was noted in the motor nerves of both legs and the left arm, as well as in a sensory nerve in the left leg. These changes indicate an axonal motor and sensory polyneuro- pathy affecting more than one limb. Because the patient had normal conduction velocities and no myopathic changes, a demyelinating or myo- pathic process is unlikely. These findings are consistent with mononeuritis multiplex \u2014 an asynchronous, asymmetric peripheral neuropa- thy that affects two or more nerves and is not explained by the presence of a single lesion.1\n\nMononeuritis Multiplex\nThe most common causes of mononeuritis multi- plex in the United States are autoimmune vasculi- tides: primary systemic vasculitis, nonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy, or a secondary vasculitis (vasculitis manifesting in a primarily nonvasculitic autoimmune disease).2 Autoimmune vasculitis causes inflammation of the vessel walls, which results in compromised blood flow that can lead to tissue ischemia and infarction. When vasculi- tis involves a nerve, the vasa nervorum is com- promised, resulting in ischemic injury to the axons. Since the vasa nervorum is supplied by small and medium-sized blood vessels, the most common type of vasculitis that causes mononeu- ritis multiplex affects small and medium-sized vessels.2\nSeveral types of small-to-medium\u2013vessel  vas-\nculitis have prominent neuropathic manifesta- tions. The presentation of mononeuritis  multiplex in patients with each of these entities is similar, so the medical history and other con- comitant manifestations can help determine the cause of the mononeuritis multiplex.\n\nPrimary Systemic Vasculitis\nPolyarteritis nodosa is a necrotizing vasculitis that mainly involves medium-sized blood ves- sels, and there are primary and secondary forms of the disease. Secondary forms include those due to hepatitis B virus infection and other in- fections. The skin is commonly affected, thus resulting in nodules, ulcers, or livedo reticularis. Mesenteric arteritis due to polyarteritis nodosa is typically manifested by abdominal pain after eating (\u201cabdominal angina\u201d) and causes mesenteric ischemia. Mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 60% of patients with polyarteritis nodosa and is a presenting symptom in approximately one third of patients.1,2 Given the absence of skin changes and abdominal symptoms in this patient, as well as a negative test for hepatitis B virus antibodies, polyarteritis nodosa is not likely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s mononeuritis multiplex.\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013 associated vasculitis affects small and medium- sized blood vessels and is characterized by sino- nasal inflammation, pulmonary parenchymal involvement, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, and the production of ANCA. Of the three types of vasculitis in this category \u2014 granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic GPA (EGPA) \u2014 mono- neuritis multiplex occurs most commonly in patients with EGPA. EGPA is associated with eosinophil-rich and granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract and with necrotiz- ing vasculitis. Asthma is a disease-defining fea- ture of EGPA and occurs in up to 99% of affected patients. Peripheral eosinophilia (in which eo- sinophils usually account for >10% of the white cells in the peripheral blood) and tissue eosino- philia (e.g., eosinophilic esophagitis, myocarditis, or pneumonia) are common conditions among patients with EGPA. It is important to note that in approximately 60% of patients with EGPA, ANCA is not produced. Up to 70% of patients with EGPA have peripheral neurologic involve- ment and present with mononeuritis multiplex or distal symmetric polyneuropathy.1,2 Given the absence of asthma and peripheral or tissue eo- sinophilia in this patient, EGPA is an unlikely diagnosis. GPA and MPA are also less likely, given the absence of sinonasal and pulmonary symptoms, along with laboratory studies that in- dicated normal kidney function and did not show evidence of hematuria or proteinuria.\nCryoglobulinemic vasculitis is a small-vessel\nvasculitis that is characterized by the deposition of immune complexes containing cryoglobulins in the capillaries, venules, and arterioles. The most common cause is hepatitis C virus infection. Manifestations include purpura and leg ulcers, as well as arthralgia and arthritis. Peripheral nerve involvement, including mononeuritis multiplex and distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, occurs\n \n\nin approximately 45% of affected patients.2 Al- though this patient\u2019s joint symptoms and vascu- litic neuropathy could be consistent with cryo- globulinemic vasculitis, the absence of hepatitis B virus or C virus infection makes this diagnosis less likely.\n\nNonsystemic Vasculitic Neuropathy\nNonsystemic vasculitic neuropathy is a single- organ vasculitis, in which patients have isolated vasculitis of the peripheral nerves without other end-organ involvement. This type of neuropathy is typically multifocal or asymmetric, is painful, involves the sensory or sensorimotor nerves, and predominantly affects the lower limbs. The pre- sentation is characterized by one or more acute episodes. Although the medical history and physical examination can prompt consideration of this diagnosis, a definitive diagnosis can be made only by means of biopsy of an affected nerve, usually with biopsy of an accompanying muscle.1,3 Because this patient had inflammatory arthritis, a systemic vasculitic neuropathy is a more likely diagnosis than a nonsystemic vascu- litic neuropathy.\n\nVasculitic Neuropathy Due to Other Autoimmune Diseases\nVasculitic neuropathy can occur in association with many autoimmune diseases in which the major manifestation is not vasculitis. These dis- eases include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, sys- temic sclerosis, mixed connective-tissue disease, sarcoidosis, and inflammatory myositis.1 How- ever, vasculitic neuropathy occurs infrequently in patients with nonvasculitic autoimmune dis- eases. Consideration of one or more autoimmune diseases in which the primary manifestation is not vasculitis should be driven by the patient\u2019s medical history and clinical presentation.\nThe patient had synovitis of the bilateral\nmetacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalange- al, and metatarsophalangeal joints. These find- ings are suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis \u2014 a symmetric, inflammatory, polyarticular, erosive arthritis that primarily involves the hands and feet. Although the joint involvement associated with rheumatoid arthritis is best known, rheu- matoid arthritis is a systemic disease with ex- traarticular manifestations that can involve multiple organ systems, including the skin, lungs, eyes, and heart. These extraarticular manifesta- tions are most common among patients in whom rheumatoid factor or anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated pep- tide antibodies are produced and who have long- standing, erosive disease.\nRheumatoid vasculitis is a small-to-medium\u2013 vessel vasculitis that is similar in appearance to the primary systemic vasculitides. It occurs in 1 to 2% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and the prevalence is declining owing to the use of early, more aggressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, which has resulted in improved disease control. Risk factors for rheumatoid vasculitis include male sex and smoking. It often mani- fests more than 10 years after the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.1,4,5\nSkin findings are the most common manifes- tation of rheumatoid vasculitis and include pur- pura, nail-fold infarcts, and cutaneous ulcers. Peripheral nervous system manifestations in- clude mononeuritis multiplex and distal senso- rimotor polyneuropathy. Ocular manifestations include episcleritis, scleritis, and peripheral ul- cerative keratitis. Rheumatoid vasculitis can also affect the heart, resulting in pericarditis, myocarditis, or coronary arteritis. Other manifestations that are common with primary small-to-medium\u2013vessel vasculitides (e.g., kidney or lung involvement) can also be seen.4,5\nGiven this patient\u2019s findings on examination of her joints, I suspect that she has rheumatoid vasculitis manifesting as a vasculitic neuropathy in the context of undiagnosed rheumatoid ar- thritis. To establish the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, I would recommend testing for rheu- matoid factor and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated pep- tide antibodies, as well as obtaining radiographs of the hands and feet. To confirm that she has a vasculitic neuropathy, I would recommend nerve and muscle biopsies. I would also test for ANCA and cryoglobulins to rule out other causes of small-vessel vasculitis.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Mandakolathur R. Murali: A blood specimen was obtained to test for autoimmune antibodies, complement levels (C3 and C4), and cryoglobu- lins (Table 2). The patient had markedly elevated titers of rheumatoid factor and anti\u2013cyclic citrul- linated peptide antibodies, together with an increased level of C-reactive protein, findings that support a diagnosis of autoimmune inflamma- tory arthritis.\nRheumatoid factor is an autoantibody (com- monly IgM and less often, IgG or IgA) that is specific to the Fc portion of IgG, with functional properties of an immune complex.6 The sensitiv- ity and specificity of rheumatoid factor to detect a rheumatic disease range from 26 to 95%, and specificity improves when other causes of an elevated level of rheumatoid factor, such as Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, have been ruled out, as was the case in this patient; laboratory tests were negative for antibodies against Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syn- drome\u2013related antigen A and antigen B, and the patient had no clinical findings suggestive of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, such as dry eyes or a dry mouth.\nAlthough high titers of rheumatoid factor are usually present in patients with rheumatoid ar- thritis, the hallmark of the autoimmune process in rheumatoid arthritis is the detection of antibodies to a constellation of citrullinated proteins,    although not all patients with rheumatoid ar- thritis produce these antibodies. Inflammatory processes result in the citrullination of proteins by peptidyl arginine deiminase, which is de- rived from neutrophils and macrophages. This enzyme deaminates not only type II collagen but also vimentin, fibrinogen, aggrecan, histones, \u03b1-enolase, and other proteins, to yield citrulli- nated derivates that serve as autoantigens.8 This process is reflected in this patient\u2019s strongly positive anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titer of 317 units (reference range, 0 to 16). Although the induction of citrullinated proteins is inflammation-dependent, the host\u2019s human leukocyte antigen (HLA) profile strongly influ- ences whether the production of these proteins leads to autoantibody formation.9 Persons with HLA-DRB1, which encodes the shared epitope sequence (the amino acid motif), are most likely to form anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide anti- bodies.\n\nTable 2.
