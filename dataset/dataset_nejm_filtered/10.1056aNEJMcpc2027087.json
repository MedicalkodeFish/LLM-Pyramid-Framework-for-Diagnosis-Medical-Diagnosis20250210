    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Neelam A. Phadke: A 54-year-old woman with a history of episodic swelling of the arms, hands, and feet was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\nTwenty-three years before the current presentation, swelling of the left hand developed after the patient sustained a human bite. The swelling was associated with mild pruritus, erythema, and warmth. The swelling was well demarcated, involved only the left hand, and resolved after 3 days without specific treatment.\nTwenty-two years before the current presentation, the patient had epigastric pain that radiated to her back, with associated nausea. Results of an upper gastro- intestinal series, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, hepatobiliary scintig- raphy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reportedly normal. The abdominal pain resolved, but two similar self-limited episodes occurred during the next year. No cause for the abdominal pain was identified.\nDuring the next 3 years, episodes of self-limited swelling occurred once per year; one episode involved the right foot, one the left hand, and one the right hand. There were no clear triggers for the episodes, although they tended to occur after exposure to cold or after minor trauma, such as scratching.\nEighteen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the hands and feet began to occur on a monthly basis, and the patient was evaluated at another hospital after an episode of swelling of the left hand. A skin-biopsy specimen reportedly showed sparse superficial dermal perivascular and interstitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate and stromal edema. Treatment with prednisone was initiated. The swelling of the left hand resolved after 3 days, and the patient was referred to the allergy clinic of this hospital. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency was made on the basis of low levels of C1 esterase inhibitor, C4, and C1q. Results of serum protein electro- phoresis were normal, and tests for antinuclear antibodies were negative. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of a third hospital, and treatment with daily danazol was initiated. The episodes of swelling of the hands and feet resolved.\nTen years before the current presentation, episodes of swelling of the eyelids and upper lip occurred with associated pruritus. The episodes began with a sensation of facial flushing, pruri- tus of the scalp, and a raised pruritic rash on the face and chest; at times, these episodes were accompanied by shortness of breath, chest tight- ness, itchy throat, and red eyes. The patient was evaluated in the allergy clinic of the third hospi- tal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The dose of danazol was increased, and the pa- tient was instructed to take hydroxyzine as needed during episodes of swelling that were associated with pruritus.\nThe swelling episodes associated with pruritus occurred with variable frequency (several times per week to once every few months) but resolved within 30 minutes after the administration of hydroxyzine. Cetirizine was substituted for hy- droxyzine for acute episodes. Treatment with daily loratadine and ranitidine was initiated, and the episodes of swelling with pruritus decreased in frequency.\nFour months before the current presentation, swelling of the right arm developed after veni- puncture. There was no associated pruritus. The patient was evaluated in the emergency depart- ment of this hospital. Ultrasonography of the arm showed no evidence of deep-vein thrombosis, and the patient was discharged from the emergency department. The swelling resolved after 3 days.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed. The patient attributed her symptoms to food poison- ing, since her daughter had similar symptoms; the symptoms resolved after 3 days.\nOne week before the current presentation, epigastric pain developed; the pain was burning in character, worsened with consumption of food, and abated with the use of nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient was evaluated at a fourth hospital, where CT of the abdomen reportedly revealed inflammation of the duodenum and jejunum. A proton-pump in- hibitor was administered, and the abdominal pain decreased. The patient was instructed not to take NSAIDs and was discharged home. However, during the next week, abdominal pain recurred, along with new symptoms of poor appetite and early satiety. She presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further care.\nOther history included  hypertension, low-back pain, and osteoporosis; she had undergone pre- vious appendectomy and cesarean section. The patient also had a subepithelial duodenal mass, measuring 7 mm in diameter, that had been stable in size during the past 5 years; ultrasono- graphic images had shown that the mass was consistent with a benign stromal cell neoplasm.\nMedications included amlodipine, calcium car- bonate, cholecalciferol, omeprazole, ranitidine, loratadine, and danazol, as well as cetirizine as needed. The patient had no known medication allergies but was allergic to iodinated contrast material. She was originally from Bangladesh and now lived with her husband and two chil- dren in a suburban community in New England and worked as a teacher. She did not smoke to- bacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension. The patient reported no similar episodes of swelling in either of her parents.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 106/81 mm Hg, the pulse 74 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The abdo- men was mildly distended with normal bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness on palpation, without rebound or involuntary guarding. The remainder of the physical examination was nor- mal. The complete blood count was normal, as were blood levels of lipase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, troponin, and thyrotropin. The ala- nine aminotransferase level was 49 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 52 IU per liter (refer- ence range, 9 to 32).\nDr. Ravi Gottumukkala: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed without the administration of oral or intravenous contrast material, revealed long-segment marked circumferential thicken- ing of the jejunal wall with associated mesen- teric edema and small-volume free intraperito- neal f luid. The remainder of the small bowel and colon showed no abnormalities (Fig. 1).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "Hereditary Angioedema with C1 Inhibitor Deficiency;Swelling Mediated by Histamine",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Aleena Banerji: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. The differential diagnosis of recurrent swelling is broad. In the United States, angio- edema has become the most common allergic disorder resulting in hospitalization, a fact that highlights the growing importance of this con- dition.1-3 In evaluating this patient with recurrent episodes of swelling, the first question is wheth- er the condition is mediated by histamine.\n\nSwelling Mediated by Histamine\nThe most common presentation of histamine- mediated swelling is chronic spontaneous urti- caria with angioedema. The urticaria typically manifests as pruritic, raised, well-circumscribed lesions. The shape of the lesions can vary from serpiginous to round or oval. The lesions can have central pallor and are often transient, last- ing less than 24 hours. The release of histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and several other mediators produced by mast cells and basophils that reside in the superficial dermis leads to erythema, flare, edema, and pruritus. It is impor- tant to note that 20 to 40% of patients will pre- sent with angioedema alone without urticaria, which can lead to a delay in diagnosis. Given that histamine-mediated angioedema is far more common than angioedema that is not mediated by histamine, trial of high-dose antihistamines is a critical first step in determining the appro- priate care for patients being evaluated for recur- rent idiopathic swelling.4 A large majority of patients with histamine-mediated swelling are identified by a decrease in symptoms while tak- ing nonsedating antihistamines at doses that are typically two to four times the usual dose.4\nSwelling Not Mediated by Histamine\nPersons with angioedema that is not mediated by histamine typically have swelling that is local- ized to the arms, legs, face, larynx, or gastroin- testinal tract. Episodes can follow specific trig- gers, such as trauma. In contrast to persons with histamine-mediated angioedema, those with angioedema that is not mediated by histamine do not tend to have pruritus, urticaria, or bron- chospasm. The swelling is usually self-limited, resolving after 3 to 5 days, and is a result of increased vascular permeability, with subsequent extravasation of intravascular fluid into the sur- rounding tissues. In persons with angioedema that is not mediated by histamine, swelling does not abate with treatment with antihistamines, glucocorticoids, or epinephrine.\nThis patient had recurrent episodes of swell-\ning with pruritus that resolved quickly with an- tihistamine therapy as needed and decreased in frequency  with daily high-dose antihistamine\n \ntherapy; these outcomes suggest that she had histamine-mediated swelling with predominant angioedema symptoms. She also had recurrent episodes of swelling involving the hands, right arm, and feet that lasted for several days and abated after treatment with danazol but not af- ter antihistamine therapy; one such episode oc- curred after venipuncture. This pattern suggests that she also had swelling that was not mediated by histamine.\nAt the time of the current presentation, the patient had abdominal pain and CT findings of jejunal-wall thickening; we had suspected that her presentation was another manifestation of swelling that was not mediated by histamine. Eighteen years before the current presentation, initial laboratory testing performed at the first hospital showed a low C1 inhibitor level as well as a low C1q level. These findings led to a diag- nosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency and initiation of treatment with danazol. The patient reported that she had had a previous response to danazol therapy. However, she was now having more frequent episodes of swelling that was not mediated by histamine, a finding that suggests a possible diagnosis of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency.\nHereditary Angioedema with C1 Inhibitor Deficiency\nHereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor defi- ciency is a rare autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by recurrent episodes of swell- ing that most commonly affect the arms, legs, gastrointestinal tract, face, or larynx \u2014 a pat- tern that fits well with this patient\u2019s history. Episodes are typically self-limited, but abdomi- nal attacks may cause severe pain, nausea, and vomiting; episodes in which the throat or larynx is affected may be fatal if untreated, owing to asphyxiation. In this patient\u2019s case, the absence of a history of angioedema in her mother and father may not support a diagnosis of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency, since it is an autosomal dominant condition. However, a family history of angioedema is absent in 20 to 25% of persons with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency, in whom spontaneous new genetic mutations presumably occur.\nAt the time of the current presentation, we recommended repeat measurement of the levels of C4, C1 inhibitor, and C1q, as well as a repeat assessment of C1 inhibitor function, to further investigate her previous diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency and the possibility of a diagnosis of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency.\n\nDr. Rohit Sharma: Although variants in multiple genes may cause genetic forms of angioedema, the absence of symptoms in this patient\u2019s parents suggests a mutation in SERPING1, which is known to have a high rate of spontaneous muta- tion. SERPING1 is located on chromosome 11 (11q12\u2013q13.1) and consists of eight exons that encode the C1 inhibitor protein (Fig. 2). Hetero- zygous loss-of-function variants in SERPING1 account for more than 95% of cases of heredi- tary angioedema, and at least 700 causative vari- ants have been reported.14 This high level of allelic heterogeneity reflects a high frequency of spontaneous mutations attributed to several ge- netic features, including proximity to the centro- mere; high CpG (cytosine\u2013guanine dinucleotide) content, which confers a predisposition to spon- taneous deamination; and multiple Alu repeats that are prone to nonhomologous recombination (Fig. 2).12 In light of this high de novo mutation rate, a variant in SERPING1 should be suspected as the cause of the symptoms in this patient, even in the absence of similar symptoms in her family. SERPING1 variants cause both hereditary angioedema type I and hereditary angioedema type II, and the type of variant correlates with the biochemical defects observed.15 Hereditary angioedema type I is typically associated with frameshift variants, gene rearrangements, inser- tions, or deletions leading to decreased C1 inhibi- tor production due to misfolding or truncation. Hereditary angioedema type II is associated with a lack of C1 inhibitor activity and is usually caused by missense pathogenic variants in the part of SERPING1 that encodes the mobile loop in the C1 inhibitor protein that is critical to its function.12,15\nBecause a variant in SERPING1 was suspected as the cause of this patient\u2019s symptoms, two types of genetic tests were requested to detect the specific variants that are known to occur in this gene. Sequencing of SERPING1 did not identify any potential pathogenic variants. However, tar- geted array comparative genomic hybridization identified a heterozygous deletion of at least exons 5 and 6 (Fig. 2). This deletion is thought to cause decreased production of C1 inhibitor from the affected allele, which is consistent with the bio- chemical findings of reduced C1 inhibitor levels and decreased C1 inhibitor activity that were seen in this patient. Together with reports of similar variants in patients with hereditary angioede- ma,16,17 these findings strongly indicate that the heterozygous deletion is indeed pathogenic and is the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nSince hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency is known to have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with full penetrance and her parents reportedly have no symptoms, it is likely that this variant arose de novo. Further- more, the patient\u2019s diagnosis arouses concern about her two children, each of whom has a 50% chance of having inherited the pathogenic dele- tion; genetic or biochemical testing of her chil- dren is warranted.\n\nTable 2.

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Mandakolathur R. Murali: The documented de- ficiency in C1 inhibitor activity in the plasma of persons with hereditary angioedema5 and the subsequent alterations in the complement pro- file are key criteria for the diagnosis of both hereditary angioedema type I or type II and ac- quired angioedema. C1 inhibitor belongs to a group of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) and is encoded by SERPING1, located on chromosome\n11 (11q12\u2013q13.1).6 C1 inhibitor regulates the enzymatic activity of the complement system as well as that of the contact-pathway protein factor XII (Hageman factor) of the coagulation system, in addition to the kinin and fibrinolytic path- ways.7 C1 inhibitor is an acute-phase protein that is synthesized primarily in the liver, and its production is augmented by interferon-\u03b3, inter- leukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. In heredi- tary angioedema type I, which accounts for ap- proximately 85% of cases, mutations in SERPING1 result in an antigenic (quantitative) deficiency in C1 inhibitor (which is encoded by SERPING1), with decreased C1 inhibitor function. In con- trast, in hereditary angioedema type II, muta- tions in SERPING1 that directly affect the critical functionally reactive central loop of C1 inhibitor result in an antigenically (quantitatively) normal C1 inhibitor level but decreased C1 inhibitor function.6\nIn the absence of C1 inhibitor, activation of\nC1r resulting from injury, inflammation, or sus- tained pressure and activation of contact-system proteins (high-molecular-weight kininogen and the two zymogens, plasma prekallikrein and factor XII) together contribute to both the diagnos- tic profile and the mechanism of angioedema that is mediated by bradykinin.8,9 Given the pathogenetic role of prekallikrein, the use of an antisense oligonucleotide (donidalorsen) that would selectively block prekallikrein has been suggested as another therapeutic approach for hereditary angioedema; the results of a phase 2 trial of donidalorsen are reported in this issue of the Journal.10,11 Increased activation of C1r and C1s leads to depletion of C4, which occurs both in remission of angioedema and during an episode of angioedema.\nIn this patient, testing for complement levels at the time of the current presentation revealed decreased levels of C4 (11 mg per deciliter; refer- ence range, 12 to 39) and C1 inhibitor (6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 19 to 37), as well as decreased C1 inhibitor function (58%; reference value, >67%). The level of C1q was normal. In patients with hereditary angioedema, the C1q level is normal, since the activation of comple- ment is distal to C1q. In patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, owing to the presence of antibodies to C1 inhibitor, the C1 inhibitor\u2013C1 inhibitor antibody complex fixes C1q and thus depletes the C1q level. Therefore, the profile of a low C4 level and a normal C1q level in this patient is suggestive of the diagnosis of heredi- tary angioedema. The decreased antigenic C1 inhibitor level in this patient, together with de- creased C1 inhibitor function, confirms a diag- nosis of hereditary angioedema type I. Inconsis- tencies between the patient\u2019s early results (from 10 years or more before the current presentation) of C1 inhibitor functional assays and those ob- tained at the time of the current presentation probably reflect the fact that the preferred ana- lytic method, the chromogenic assay, was not widely used at the time of the initial assess- ments. Table 2 summarizes the various profiles of complement activation in bradykinin-induced angioedema.\nDr. Rohit Sharma: Although variants in multiple genes may cause genetic forms of angioedema, the absence of symptoms in this patient\u2019s par",
