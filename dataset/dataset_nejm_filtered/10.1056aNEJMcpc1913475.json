    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Max C. Petersen (Medicine): A 34-year-old woman was evaluated in the diabetes clinic of this hospital for hyperglycemia.\nEleven years before this presentation, the blood glucose level was 126 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol per liter) on routine laboratory evaluation, which was per- formed as part of an annual well visit. The patient could not recall whether she had been fasting at the time the test had been performed. One year later, the fast- ing blood glucose level was 112 mg per deciliter (6.2 mmol per liter; reference range, <100 mg per deciliter [<5.6 mmol per liter]).\nNine years before this presentation, a randomly obtained blood glucose level was 217 mg per deciliter (12.0 mmol per liter), and the patient reported polyuria. At that time, the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.8% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6); the hemoglobin level was normal. One year later, the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.9%. The height was 165.1 cm, the weight 72.6 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. The patient received a diagnosis of prediabetes and was referred to a nutritionist. She made changes to her diet and lost 4.5 kg of body weight over a 6-month pe- riod; the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.5%.\nSix years before this presentation, the patient became pregnant with her first child. Her prepregnancy BMI was 24.5. At 26 weeks of gestation, the result of a 1-hour oral glucose challenge test (i.e., the blood glucose level obtained 1 hour after the oral administration of a 50-g glucose load in the nonfasting state) was 186 mg per deciliter (10.3 mmol per liter; reference range, <140 mg per deciliter [<7.8 mmol per liter]). She declined a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test; a pre- sumptive diagnosis of gestational diabetes was made. She was asked to follow a meal plan for gestational diabetes and was treated with insulin during the preg- nancy. Serial ultrasound examinations for fetal growth and monitoring were per- formed. At 34 weeks of gestation, the fetal abdominal circumference was in the 76th percentile for gestational age. Polyhydramnios developed at 37 weeks of gestation. The child was born at 39 weeks 3 days of gestation, weighed 3.9 kg at birth, and had hypoglycemia after birth, which subsequently resolved. Six weeks post partum, the patient\u2019s fasting blood glucose level was 120 mg per deciliter (6.7 mmol per liter), and the result of a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (i.e., the blood glucose level obtained 2 hours after the oral administration of a 75-g glucose load in the fast- ing state) was 131 mg per deciliter (7.3 mmol per liter; reference range, <140 mg per deciliter). Three months post partum, the glycated hemo- globin level was 6.1%. Lifestyle modification for diabetes prevention was recommended.\nFour and a half years before this presentation,\nthe patient became pregnant with her second child. Her prepregnancy BMI was 25.1. At 5 weeks of gestation, she had an elevated blood glucose level. Insulin therapy was started at 6 weeks of gestation, and episodes of hypoglycemia occurred during the pregnancy. Serial ultrasound exami- nations for fetal growth and monitoring were performed. At 28 weeks of gestation, the fetal abdominal circumference was in the 35th percen- tile for gestational age, and the amniotic fluid level was normal. Labor was induced at 38 weeks of gestation; the child weighed 2.6 kg at birth. Neonatal blood glucose levels were reported as stable after birth. Six weeks post partum, the patient\u2019s fasting blood glucose level was 133 mg per deciliter (7.4 mmol per liter), and the result of a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was 236 mg per deciliter (13.1 mmol per liter). The patient received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus; lifestyle modification was recommended. Three months post partum, the glycated hemoglobin level was 5.9% and the BMI was 30.0. Over the next 2 years, she followed a low-carbohydrate diet and regular exercise plan and self-moni- tored the blood glucose level.\nTwo years before this presentation, the pa-\ntient became pregnant with her third child. Blood glucose levels were again elevated, and insulin therapy was started early in gestation. She had episodes of hypoglycemia that led to adjustment of her insulin regimen. The child was born at 38 weeks 5 days of gestation, weighed 3.0 kg at birth, and had hypoglycemia that re- solved 48 hours after birth. After the birth of her third child, the patient started to receive metfor- min, which had no effect on the glycated hemo- globin level, despite adjustment of the therapy to the maximal dose.\nOne year before this presentation, the patient became pregnant with her fourth child. Insulin therapy was again started early in gestation. The patient reported that episodes of hypoglycemia occurred. Polyhydramnios developed. The child was born at 38 weeks 6 days of gestation and weighed 3.5 kg. The patient sought care at the diabetes clinic of this hospital for clarification of her diagnosis.\nThe patient reported following a low-carbohy- drate diet and exercising 5 days per week. There was no fatigue, change in appetite, change in vision, chest pain, shortness of breath, polydipsia, or polyuria. There was no history of anemia, pancreatitis, hirsutism, proximal muscle weak- ness, easy bruising, headache, sweating, tachy- cardia, gallstones, or diarrhea. Her menstrual periods were normal. She had not noticed any changes in her facial features or the size of her hands or feet.\nThe patient had a history of acne and low-back pain. Her only medication was metformin. She had no known medication allergies. She lived with her husband and four children in a subur- ban community in New England and worked as an administrator. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs, and she rarely drank alcohol. She identified as non-Hispanic white. Both of her grandmothers had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her father had hypertension, was overweight, and had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at 50 years of age. Her mother was not overweight and had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at 48 years of age. The patient had two sisters, neither of whom had a history of diabetes or gestational diabetes. There was no family history of hemo- chromatosis.\nOn examination, the patient appeared  well.\nThe blood pressure was 126/76 mm Hg, and the heart rate 76  beats per minute. The BMI was 25.4. The physical examination was normal. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.2%.\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Miriam S. Udler: I am aware of the diagnosis in this case and participated in the care of this patient. This healthy 34-year-old woman, who had a BMI just above the upper limit of the normal range, presented with a history of hyperglycemia of varying degrees since 24 years of age. When she was not pregnant, she was treated with life-style measures as well as metformin therapy for a short period, and she maintained a well-con- trolled blood glucose level. In thinking about this case, it is helpful to characterize the extent of the hyperglycemia and then to consider its possible causes.\n\nCharacterizing Hyperglycemia\nThis patient\u2019s hyperglycemia reached a threshold that was diagnostic of diabetes1 on two occa- sions: when she was 25 years of age, she had a randomly obtained blood glucose level of 217 mg per deciliter with polyuria (with diabetes defined as a level of \u2265200 mg per deciliter [\u226511.1 mmol per liter] with symptoms), and when she was 30 years of age, she had on the same encounter a fasting blood glucose level of 133 mg per deciliter (with diabetes defined as a level of \u2265126 mg per deci- liter) and a result on a 2-hour oral glucose toler- ance test of 236 mg per deciliter (with diabetes defined as a level of \u2265200 mg per deciliter). On both of these occasions, her glycated hemoglo- bin level was in the prediabetes range (defined as 5.7 to 6.4%). In establishing the diagnosis of diabetes, the various blood glucose studies and glycated hemoglobin testing may provide discor- dant information because the tests have differ- ent sensitivities for this diagnosis, with glycated hemoglobin testing being the least sensitive.2 Also, there are situations in which the glycated hemoglobin level can be inaccurate; for example, the patient may have recently received a blood transfusion or may have a condition that alters the life span of red cells, such as anemia, hemo- globinopathy, or pregnancy.3 These conditions were not present in this patient at the time that the glycated hemoglobin measurements were ob- tained. In addition, since the glycated hemoglo- bin level reflects the average glucose level typi- cally over a 3-month period, discordance with timed blood glucose measurements can occur if there has been a recent change in glycemic con- trol. This patient had long-standing mild hyper- glycemia but met criteria for diabetes on the basis of the blood glucose levels noted.\nDiabetes\nType 1 and Type 2 Diabetes\nNow that we have characterized the patient\u2019s hyperglycemia as meeting criteria for diabetes, it is important to consider the possible types. More than 90% of adults with diabetes have type 2\n \ndiabetes, which is due to progressive loss of in- sulin secretion by beta cells that frequently oc- curs in the context of insulin resistance. This patient had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabe- tes; however, some patients with diabetes may be given a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes on the basis of not having features of type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by autoimmune destruc- tion of the pancreatic beta cells that leads to rapid development of insulin dependence, with ketoacidosis often present at diagnosis.\nType 1 diabetes accounts for approximately 6% of all cases of diabetes in adults (\u226518 years of age) in the United States,4 and 80% of these cases are diagnosed before the patient is 20 years of age.5 Since this patient\u2019s diabetes was essen- tially nonprogressive over a period of at least 9 years, she most likely does not have type 1 diabetes. It is therefore not surprising that she had received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, but there are several other types of diabetes to con- sider, particularly since some features of her case do not fit with a typical case of type 2 dia- betes, such as her age at diagnosis, the presence of hyperglycemia despite a nearly normal BMI, and the mild and nonprogressive nature of her disease over the course of many years.\n\nLess Common Types of Diabetes\nLatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a mild form of autoimmune diabetes that should be considered in this patient. However, there is controversy as to whether LADA truly represents an entity that is distinct from type 1 diabetes.6 Both patients with type 1 diabetes and patients with LADA commonly have elevated levels of dia- betes-associated autoantibodies; however, LADA has been defined by an older age at onset (typi- cally >25 years) and slower progression to insu- lin dependence (over a period of >6 months).7 This patient had not been tested for diabetes- associated autoantibodies. I ordered these tests to help evaluate for LADA, but this was not my leading diagnosis because of her young age at diagnosis and nonprogressive clinical course over a period of at least 9 years.\nIf the patient\u2019s diabetes had been confined to pregnancy, we might consider gestational diabetes, but she had hyperglycemia outside of pregnancy. Several medications can cause hyper- glycemia, including glucocorticoids, atypical anti- psychotic agents, cancer immunotherapies, and some antiretroviral therapies and immunosup- pressive agents used in transplantation.8 How- ever, this patient was not receiving any of these medications. Another cause of diabetes to con- sider is destruction of the pancreas due to, for example, cystic fibrosis, a tumor, or pancreatitis, but none of these were present. Secondary endo- crine disorders \u2014 including excess cortisol pro- duction, excess growth hormone production, and pheochromocytoma \u2014 were considered to be un- likely in this patient on the basis of the history, review of symptoms, and physical examination.\n\nMonogenic Diabetes\nA final category to consider is monogenic diabe- tes, which is caused by alteration of a single gene. Types of monogenic diabetes include maturity- onset diabetes of the young (MODY), neonatal diabetes, and syndromic forms of diabetes. Mono- genic diabetes accounts for 1 to 6% of cases of diabetes in children9 and approximately 0.4% of cases in adults.10 Neonatal diabetes is diagnosed typically within the first 6 months of life; syn- dromic forms of monogenic diabetes have other abnormal features, including particular organ dysfunction. Neither condition is applicable to this patient.\n\nMODY\nMODY is an autosomal dominant condition char- acterized by primary pancreatic beta-cell dys- function that causes mild diabetes that is diag- nosed during adolescence or early adulthood. As early as 1964, the nomenclature \u201cmaturity-onset diabetes of the young\u201d was used to describe cases that resembled adult-onset type 2 diabetes in terms of the slow progression to insulin use (as compared with the rapid progression in type 1 diabetes) but occurred in relatively young pa- tients.11 Several genes cause distinct forms of MODY that have specific disease features that inform treatment, and thus MODY is a clinically important diagnosis. Most forms of MODY cause isolated abnormal glucose levels (in contrast to syndromic monogenic diabetes), a manifestation that has contributed to its frequent misdiagnosis as type 1 or type 2 diabetes.12\n\nGenetic Basis of MODY\nAlthough at least 13 genes have been associated with MODY, 3 genes \u2014 GCK, which encodes glucokinase, and HNF1A and HNF4A, which en- code hepatocyte nuclear factors 1A and 4A, re- spectively \u2014 account for most cases. MODY associated with GCK (known as GCK-MODY) is characterized by mild, nonprogressive hypergly- cemia that is present since birth, whereas the forms of MODY associated with HNF1A and HNF4A (known as HNF1A-MODY and HNF4A- MODY, respectively) are characterized by the development of diabetes, typically in the early teen years or young adulthood, that is initially mild and then progresses such that affected patients may receive insulin before diagnosis.\nIn patients with GCK-MODY, genetic variants\nreduce the function of glucokinase, the enzyme in pancreatic beta cells that functions as a glu- cose sensor and controls the rate of entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway. As a result, reduced sensitivity to glucose-induced insulin secretion causes asymptomatic mild fasting hy- perglycemia, with an upward shift in the normal range of the fasting blood glucose level to 100 to 145 mg per deciliter (5.6 to 8.0 mmol per liter), and also causes an upward shift in postprandial blood glucose levels, but with tight regulation maintained (Fig. 1).13 This mild hyperglycemia is not thought to confer a predisposition to com- plications of diabetes,14 is largely unaltered by treatment,15 and does not necessitate treatment outside of pregnancy.\nIn contrast to GCK-MODY, the disorders\nHNF1A-MODY and HNF4A-MODY result in pro- gressive hyperglycemia that eventually leads to treatment.16 Initially, there may be a normal fasting glucose level and large spikes in post- prandial glucose levels (to >80 mg per deciliter [>4.4 mmol per liter]).17 Patients can often be treated with oral agents and discontinue insulin therapy started before the diagnosis of MODY.18 Of note, patients with HNF1A-MODY or HNF4A- MODY are typically sensitive to treatment with sulfonylureas19 but may also respond to glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonists.20\nThis patient had received a diagnosis of diabetes before 35 years of age, had a family his- tory of diabetes involving multiple generations, and was not obese. These features are suggestive of MODY but do not represent absolute criteria for the condition (Fig. 1).1 Negative testing for diabetes-associated autoantibodies would fur- ther increase the likelihood of MODY. There are methods to calculate a patient\u2019s risk of having MODY associated with GCK, HNF1A, or HNF4A.21,22 Using an online calculator (www.diabetesgenes\n.org/mody-probability-calculator), we estimate that the probability of this patient having MODY is at least 75.5%. Genetic testing would be needed to confirm this diagnosis, and in patients at an increased risk for MODY, multigene panel test- ing has been shown to be cost-effective.\n\n\n",

One clinically significant variant was identified in the GCK gene (NM_000162.3): a c.787T\u2192C transition resulting in the p.Ser263Pro missense change. Review of the literature and variant databases revealed that this variant had been previously identified in at least three pa- tients with early-onset diabetes and had segre- gated with disease in at least three affected members of two families (GeneDx: personal communication).25,26 Furthermore, the variant was rare in large population databases (occurring in 1 out of 128,844 European chromosomes in gnomAD27), a feature consistent with a disease- causing role. Although the serine residue at posi- tion 263 was not highly conserved, multiple in vitro functional studies have shown that the p.Ser263Pro variant negatively affects the stabil- ity of the glucokinase enzyme.26,28-30 As a result, this variant met criteria to be classified as \u201clikely pathogenic.\u201d31 As mentioned previously, a diagnosis of GCK-MODY is consistent with this patient\u2019s clinical features. On subsequent testing of additional family members, the same \u201clikely pathogenic\u201d variant was identified in the patient\u2019s father and second child, both of whom had documented hyperglycemia.",
