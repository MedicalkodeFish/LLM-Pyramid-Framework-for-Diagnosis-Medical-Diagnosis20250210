    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Alison C. Castle: A 56-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital in the spring of 2020, during the initial surge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pan- demic in Boston, because of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and a dry cough.\nSix weeks before this admission, the patient had contact with a person with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infec- tion. At that time, she did not have any symptoms compatible with Covid-19 and was not tested for SARS-CoV-2.\nFour weeks before this admission, in accordance with statewide recommenda- tions from the Department of Public Health, the patient began isolating at home with her teenage son, working from home, and having groceries delivered. Two weeks before this admission, she and her son left home for a few hours to eat outdoors and spend time in a wooded area; they otherwise remained at home.\nSix days before this admission, fever, chills, and myalgias developed. The next day, watery diarrhea occurred. The patient\u2019s temperature measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C; fever persisted despite the intermittent administration of acetaminophen. Three days before this admission, a frontal headache developed, along with a dry cough that was associated with a self-limited episode of chest pain. The patient\u2019s son had had no symptoms, except for a self-limited episode of diarrhea 2 weeks before the patient\u2019s symptoms developed. On the day of admission, the patient continued to have fever, so she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported ongoing myalgias, head- ache, and cough. There was no nausea, vomiting, rash, shortness of breath, or anosmia. She had no notable medical history and took no medications. She was allergic to amoxicillin, with an unknown reaction. She did not smoke tobacco and drank alcohol rarely; she did not use illicit drugs. The patient lived in an urban area of New England and had traveled to Canada 6 months before this admission. She had a pet cat; there was no other animal contact.\nOn examination, the patient appeared anxious, but breathing was unlabored. The temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 121/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% at rest and 98% during ambula- tion, both while she was breathing ambient air. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person. There were no focal neurologic deficits. There was no meningism. The mucous membranes were dry. The first and second heart sounds were normal, without additional sounds or murmurs. There were vesicular breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly. There was no rash. Labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Patrick P. Bourgouin: Chest radiography revealed low lung volumes, without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema.\nDr. Castle: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal specimen was negative, as was testing for adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza vi- rus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, Bordetella per- tussis, B. parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Blood cultures were nega- tive. Urinalysis was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The procalcitonin level was 0.36 ng per milliliter (reference range, 0.00 to 0.08). Intra- venous fluids and acetaminophen were adminis- tered, and the heart rate decreased to 93 beats per minute. The patient was admitted to this hos- pital because of concerns that she had Covid-19. On the second hospital day, the patient had ongoing diarrhea, headache, and cough, along with fatigue. The temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 115/64 mm Hg, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The administration of intravenous fluids was contin- ued. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing of a second nasopharyngeal specimen was negative. Labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. On the third hospital day, the temperature was 38.7\u00b0C.\nDr. Bourgouin: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed inter- lobular septal thickening, mild ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, and small bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 1).\nDr. Castle: During the next 3 days, the patient had ongoing myalgias, headache, and cough. Fever persisted, and the oxygen saturation re- mained normal. Urine antigen testing for legion- ella and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens was negative, as was screening for human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and nucleic acid testing of a blood specimen for cytomega- lovirus and Epstein\u2013Barr virus. Blood cultures remained negative.\nOn the seventh hospital day, diarrhea resolved, but fever, myalgias, headache, and cough persist- ed. The physical examination was unchanged, with a normal oxygen saturation during ambulation.\nDr. Bourgouin: Chest radiography revealed no evidence of pneumonia.\nDr. Castle: The procalcitonin level was 0.57 ng per milliliter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Levofloxacin was administered. On the eighth hospital day, fever resolved but headache and fatigue persisted.\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Evin Yucel: This 62-year-old woman, with a his- tory of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a complicated abdominoplasty, and percutaneous trans- catheter closure of a fenestrated ASD, presented with recurrent symptomatic hemorrhagic peri- cardial effusion. Her presentation was subacute, with evidence of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade on TTE.\n\nCardiac Tamponade\nCardiac tamponade is a cardiac emergency, in which there is often rapid accumulation of peri- cardial fluid resulting in a sudden increase in intrapericardial pressure. When the intrapericar- dial pressure exceeds the intracardiac pressures, the atrial and ventricular walls invert, which initially results in a decrease in diastolic filling and eventually a decrease in cardiac output. If cardiac tamponade is left untreated, cardiogenic shock ensues, which can result in death. De- pending on the clinical scenario, pericardiocen- tesis can be performed for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.\n\nHemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion\nAlthough there are many causes of pericardial effusion, in this patient, we can quickly narrow the differential diagnosis on the basis of the hemorrhagic nature of the effusion. Viral infec- tions, metabolic abnormalities (e.g., uremia and hypothyroidism), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclero- sis, and mixed connective-tissue disease) are common causes of pericardial effusion; however, these conditions often lead to transudative and nonhemorrhagic effusions.\nAortic dissection leading to aortic-wall injury and penetrating trauma are two devastating causes of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and usually develop very abruptly. This patient did not have a recent history of trauma, and aortic dissection was ruled out with the CTA scan of the chest.\nMyocardial infarction complicated by freewall rupture resulting in cardiac tamponade also develops suddenly. This patient\u2019s ECG did not show any ischemic changes, her troponin levels were normal, and TTE did not reveal any wall- motion abnormalities; these findings make this diagnosis unlikely.\nAlthough uncommon in the United States, tuberculous pericarditis can occur in patients with tuberculosis and could cause hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.1 This patient did not have constitutional symptoms before her initial pre- sentation, and chest imaging did not show find- ings consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. However, some studies have shown that patients with tuberculous pericarditis may not have clas- sic signs and symptoms of pulmonary tubercu- losis.2,3 Another clue to assist in the diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis would be a lymphocytic and monocytic cell predominance in the pericar- dial fluid; however, this patient\u2019s pericardial fluid had a predominance of neutrophils. Diag- nosis of tuberculous pericarditis can be challeng- ing because a mycobacterial (acid-fast bacilli) smear of the pericardial fluid can be negative in up to 60% of patients with this condition.4 Ad- ditional testing of adenosine deaminase activity in the pericardial fluid could be performed.2,5\nIn the United States, metastatic disease is  a\ncommon cause of symptomatic hemorrhagic peri- cardial effusion. Lung, breast, and esophageal cancers are the most common, whereas mela- noma, lymphoma, leukemia, and acquired immu- nodeficiency syndrome\u2013related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma are less common.6,7 The diagnostic utility of cy- tologic analysis of pericardial fluid is well estab- lished; although its sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant effusion is variable, it has a speci- ficity of 100%, and therefore it is important to perform this analysis in all patients with hemor- rhagic effusion.6,8,9 In addition, immunohisto- chemical staining could detect malignant cells and can aid in differentiating among various tissues of origin. Pericardial biopsy is reserved for patients with a high probability of cancer who have already undergone nondiagnostic cyto- logic analysis and immunohistochemical stain- ing of the pericardial fluid. This patient had a recent negative mammogram and cervical can- cer screening. Although she had been a smoker,there was no lymphadenopathy on chest imaging, and only a 4-mm nodule in the right lower lobe was noted. Cytologic testing of the pericar- dial fluid was reportedly negative for cancer. Therefore, a malignant pericardial effusion is unlikely.\nPercutaneous cardiac procedures, such as pace- maker implantation, coronary angioplasty, pro- cedures that involve interatrial septostomy, and transcatheter valve interventions, can also cause hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and often re- sult in a sudden onset of this condition. This patient had undergone percutaneous ASD closure 14 years earlier. Device erosion leading to cardiac perforation has been described and most often occurs within 6 months after the closure procedure, although there are case reports docu- menting the occurrence of device erosion up to 3 years after the closure procedure.10,11\nFor this patient, it would be helpful to review the original intraprocedural echocardiographic imaging to evaluate the anterior interatrial sep- tal tissue rim, since a deficient anterior rim has been proposed as one of the predictors of device erosion into the aorta. On the CT scan, the Am- platzer septal occluder device appeared to be too large for the size of her current interatrial sep- tum, a finding that also introduces the possibil- ity of device erosion. In addition, the patient had had successful weight-loss  surgery more  than 8 years after the implantation of the device. A few reports have shown a clinically significant reduction in the left atrial area and volume among patients who have undergone weight-loss surgery.12,13 Lastly, we know that the patient had had complications after abdominal surgery. It would be essential to review the imaging find- ings with the radiologist to evaluate for dia- phragmatic paralysis, which, if present, could also have distorted her cardiac anatomy and led to erosion of the device.\nMy diagnosis is device erosion due to remod-\neling of the left atrium, leading to the subacute accumulation of pericardial fluid. Transesopha- geal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac CT, or car- diac magnetic resonance imaging could be help- ful in establishing a definitive diagnosis; however, given that the patient\u2019s presentation was sub- acute, flow into the pericardium may not be vi- sualized with these imaging studies.\n",
