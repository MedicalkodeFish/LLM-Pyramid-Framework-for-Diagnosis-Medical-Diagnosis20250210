    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Joshua U. Okonkwo (Neurology): An 80-year-old man was evaluated in the neurol- ogy clinic of this hospital because of left foot drop.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 5 years before the current presentation, when he first noticed that he needed to lift up his left leg while walking in order to prevent the toes of his left foot from dragging on the ground. During the next 2 years, his ability to dorsiflex the left ankle decreased progres- sively. Three years before this presentation, he began to use an ankle\u2013foot orthosis. One year before this presentation, the patient was evaluated in a neurology clinic affiliated with another hospital. He reported left foot drop, as well as oc- casional falls that he attributed to poor balance. Examination reportedly revealed wasting in the muscles below the left knee, weakness with attempts at dorsiflexion and eversion of the left ankle, loss of pinprick sensation to the midshins in both legs, and decreased vibratory sensation in the toes of both feet. The blood levels of cobalamin, folate, thyrotropin, and glycated hemoglobin and the results of se- rum protein electrophoresis were reportedly normal. Tests for syphilis and anti- nuclear antibodies were negative, as were blood tests for antibodies to sulfate- 3-glucuronyl paragloboside and myelin-associated glycoprotein and a serum paraneoplastic autoantibody panel. The blood creatine kinase level was 456 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 194) and the aldolase level 5.8 U per liter (reference\nvalue, <8.1). Imaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was reportedly normal. MRI of the lumbar spine reportedly revealed diffuse disk bulging with facet hypertrophy at multiple levels, which was contributing to mild spinal stenosis. Needle electro- myography (EMG) of the left leg reportedly showed changes consistent with moderate-to-severe, subacute-to-chronic radiculopathy at L5 and S1 on the left side. The patient declined further workup at that time. One year later, his symptoms had not resolved, and he presented to the neurology clinic of this hospital for\nfurther evaluation.\nOn the current evaluation, the patient reported stable left foot drop and mild low-back pain without radiating symptoms. He had no bowel or bladder changes,no double vision or hearing changes, and no dif- ficulty with breathing, chewing, or swallowing. His medical history included hypertension, dys- lipidemia, and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, which had been treated with local radiation therapy 4 years before this presentation. Medi- cations included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metoprolol, and simvastatin. The patient was married, resided in New England, and was retired from work in the insurance industry. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit smoking 30 years before this presentation. He drank four alcoholic drinks per day. His sister had breast cancer, and his father had died in his 70s from esophageal cancer.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.1. He had a step- page gait pattern with prominent left foot drop. He could not walk on his left heel, but he was able to walk on his left toes and to walk with a tandem gait.\nThere was mild facial weakness, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side, with an asymmetric smile and weak eye closure and cheek puffing. The optic disks had sharp margins. The pupils were round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements were full. There was no weakness or atrophy of the jaw, palate, or tongue. Hearing was grossly intact. Shoulder shrug was asymmetric, with less rise on the right side. A motor examination revealed wasting of the shoulder girdle, which was more prominent on the right side, and wasting of the calves. Tone was mildly decreased throughout, and there were no fasciculations. There was severe scapular winging, which was present on both sides but was more prominent on the right side. There was no action or percus- sion myotonia or paramyotonia.\nStrength was assessed according to the Med-\nical Research Council scale, which ranges from  0 (no visible muscle contraction) to 5 (normal strength). On the right and left sides, strength was 4 and 4+, respectively, on shoulder abduc- tion; 5 and 3 on ankle dorsiflexion; 4+ and 4 on big-toe extension; 5 and 4+ on ankle inversion; and 5 and 4\u2212 on ankle eversion. On both sides,strength was 4+ on hip flexion and was normal on neck flexion and extension, elbow flexion and extension, wrist flexion and extension, finger extension and abduction, thumb abduction, hip abduction, knee f lexion and extension, and plantar flexion. Deep-tendon reflexes were 1+ at the biceps, 1+ at the triceps, trace at the brachio- radialis, 2+ at the knees, and not elicited at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor. There was loss of pinprick and temperature sensations to the midshins in both legs, as well as decreased vibratory sensation to the ankles. Imaging stud- ies were obtained.\nDr. Karen A. Buch: MRI of the lumbar spine\n(Fig. 1) revealed a large, leftward, eccentric disk herniation at L5 and S1 that impinged on the exiting L5 nerve roots, with greater impinge- ment on the left side than on the right side. There was narrowing of the left subarticular zone and left lateral recess that encroached on the descending left S1 nerve root. Facet hyper- trophy and ligamentous infolding at multiple levels were contributing to mild central spinal stenosis.\n\nFigure 1.

An axial T2-weighted image (Panel B) shows a diffuse disk bulge that is in contact with, and is possibly impinging on, the descending left S1 nerve root (arrow); there is no high-grade central spinal stenosis at this level.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Paloma Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e9rez: This 80-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of progressive and painless left foot drop. Examination re- vealed weakness that involved not only distal left-leg muscles but also facial, periscapular, hip- flexor, and distal right-leg muscles. In construct- ing a differential diagnosis, I will begin by local- izing the patient\u2019s symptoms and examination findings within the nervous system.\nDo the patient\u2019s deficits localize to the cen- tral nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral ner- vous system (PNS)? CNS disorders affect the brain or spinal cord, whereas PNS disorders in- volve the anterior horns, nerve roots, plexus, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscles.\n\nCNS Disorders\nAlthough the most common causes of foot drop are PNS disorders, CNS processes that disrupt the upper-motor-neuron tract (anywhere from the medial homunculus of the primary motor cortex at the frontal lobe, where the leg is repre- sented, to the ventral gray matter of the spinal cord) should be considered.1-6 However, such pro- cesses rarely cause foot drop in isolation. This patient did not have any upper-motor-neuron signs (such as increased muscle tone, clonus or brisk deep-tendon reflexes, or an extensor plan- tar response) that would suggest an insult to the corticospinal tract in either the brain or the spinal cord. Moreover, a brain MRI was report- edly normal, and he did not have neck pain, sphincter dysfunction, or sensory loss at a level that would suggest myelopathy.\nA CNS disorder that can mimic foot drop is dystonia, which can be the first manifestation of a parkinsonian syndrome.7,8 Dystonia is caused  by dysfunction of the network involving the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and somatosensory cortex. In patients with dystonia that mimics foot drop, the results of brain imaging can be normal. However, muscle strength, muscle bulk, and deep-tendon reflexes would also be normal, and this patient had muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and hyporeflexia.\nFocal PNS Disorders\nAmong causes of foot drop that localize to the PNS, focal disorders are more prevalent than generalized disorders. Focal PNS disorders in- clude deep peroneal neuropathy, common pero- neal neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy, lumbosacral plexopathy, and L5 radiculopathy. All these dis- orders can present with foot drop due to weak- ness of the tibialis anterior muscle, which is involved in ankle dorsiflexion.\nIsolated neuropathy of the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve is unlikely in this pa- tient because he had weakness on ankle ever- sion, an action performed by the peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles, which are inner- vated by the superficial branch of the common peroneal nerve. Common peroneal neuropathy is also unlikely because he had weakness on ankle inversion, an action performed by the tibialis posterior muscle, which is innervated by the tibial nerve.\nSciatic neuropathy with preferential involve- ment of the peroneal division that runs lateral to the tibial division (and is therefore more prone to injury) is a plausible explanation. However, this patient\u2019s 5-year history of progressive foot drop without reported sensory symptoms or pain would be atypical of sciatic neuropathy. In addition, sciatic neuropathy is often a complica- tion of either trauma or hip surgery, neither of which had occurred in this patient.\nThe absence of pain and sensory symptoms would also be atypical of left lumbosacral plexopathy. An important exception is radiation- induced lumbosacral plexopathy, which is usu- ally painless. However, symptoms in this patient developed 1 year before treatment with radia- tion. L5 radiculopathy is a common cause of foot drop, and MRI of the lumbar spine in this pa- tient revealed impingement on the left L5 nerve root. However, the absence of pain and sensory symptoms would be uncommon for L5 radicu- lopathy.\nNo focal PNS disorder would fully account for this patient\u2019s left-leg weakness. In addition, he had what I would describe as a \u201cfoot drop plus syndrome.\u201d I suspect that a generalized PNS disorder could provide a unifying diagnosis for both the left foot drop and the other muscle weakness noted on physical examination.\n\nGeneralized PNS Disorders\nNeuromuscular-Junction Disorders\nGeneralized PNS disorders can be further local- ized to the neuromuscular junction, nerve struc- tures, or muscles. This patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with a neuromuscular-junction dis- order, such as myasthenia gravis or the Lambert\u2013 Eaton myasthenic syndrome. He did not have ocular symptoms or fluctuating weakness, find- ings that would be suggestive of myasthenia gravis, and he did not have fatigue, a common feature of the Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syn- drome. In addition, the distribution of muscle weakness seen in this patient would be atypical of a neuromuscular-junction disorder. The mus- cle groups that were most severely affected in this patient were the periscapular muscles and the muscles in the anterior compartment of the left leg; this scapuloperoneal distribution of muscle weakness is suggestive of either a neuro- genic disorder or a myopathic disorder.\n\nNeurogenic Disorders\nNeurogenic causes of scapuloperoneal syndrome include Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1C and rare forms of spinal muscular atrophy.9-12 Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease type 1C is unlikely in the absence of additional clinical features  such as pes cavus deformity, hammer toe, sen- sory symptoms, and generalized areflexia. Spi- nal muscular atrophy with a scapuloperoneal distribution of muscle weakness is unlikely  in the absence of skeletal dysplasia, vocal cord palsy, and muscle agenesis. Although progres- sive foot drop can be the first symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a scapulo- peroneal distribution of muscle weakness with\n \nintact strength of the distal arms argues against  a diagnosis of ALS.\n\nDistinguishing Neurogenic from Myopathic Disorders\nA finding on physical examination that can be helpful in differentiating neurogenic causes of foot drop from myopathic causes is  the bulk  of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle (located in the dorsum of the foot). In patients with neu- rogenic foot drop, length-dependent involvement of muscles innervated by the same nerve would be expected. The extensor digitorum brevis muscle and the tibialis anterior muscle (located in the anterolateral aspect of the shin) are both innervated by the deep branch of the common peroneal nerve. Atrophy of the extensor digito- rum brevis muscle that precedes weakness  of the tibialis anterior muscle would be suggestive of a neurogenic disorder. Normal bulk of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle in the pres- ence of weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle is highly suggestive of a myopathic disorder. We do not know whether this patient had normal bulk of the left extensor digitorum brevis mus- cle, so I will rely on other clinical features to determine whether he had a neurogenic or myo- pathic disorder.\nScapuloperoneal  syndromes  due  to neurogenic disorders are usually characterized by symmetric or slightly asymmetric muscle weak- ness. The strikingly asymmetric muscle weak- ness in this patient is more typical of scapulo- peroneal syndromes due to myopathic disorders. In addition, the anatomical progression of muscle weakness in this patient helps in distin- guishing between neurogenic and myopathic disorders. Patients with adult-onset neurogenic scapuloperoneal syndromes typically have weak- ness that begins in distal muscles and progresses to involve proximal muscles (centripetal spread- ing); foot drop may develop at a young age, and weakness may advance from distal to proximal muscles over a period of decades. By contrast, foot drop developed in this patient in the eighth decade of life. I suspect that he had weakness that began in the facial and proximal muscles when he was much younger, but the symptoms either were unnoticed or did not cause enough interference with activities of daily living for him to seek medical attention. The weakness then progressed from proximal to distal muscles (centrifugal spreading) over a period of decades, leading him to seek medical attention for foot drop at 75 years of age. Centrifugal progression is more typical of myopathy.\nThe asymmetry and possible centrifugal pro- gression of this patient\u2019s muscle weakness point toward a myopathic disorder. However, the EMG findings did not appear to show early recruit- ment of motor-unit action potentials (with short duration and low amplitude), which would be suggestive of a myopathic process. Instead, the EMG findings were reportedly consistent with a neurogenic process such as L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy. It is important to note that the absence of a myopathic pattern on EMG does not rule out myopathy. It can be difficult to identify a myo- pathic pattern on EMG in the presence of a super- imposed neurogenic process (such as radicu- lopathy), and some myopathies may have a pseudoneurogenic pattern.13-15 Although L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy may be present in this patient, I suspect that a myopathy is the main contributor to his foot drop.\n\nMyopathic Disorders\nAlthough most acquired and hereditary myopa- thies are associated with a proximal and rela- tively symmetric distribution of muscle weak- ness, some typically affect distal muscles  and can be asymmetric. In particular, a scapulopero- neal distribution can be seen with facioscapulo- humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), Emery\u2013 Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, myofibrillar myopathies, congenital myopathies, and Pompe disease.16,17 The presence of facial muscle weakness and the striking asymmetry of scapuloperoneal muscle weakness in this patient are highly suggestive of FSHD.\n\nFacioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy FSHD is the second most common muscular dystrophy in adults, following myotonic dystro- phy type 1. It is caused by dominantly inherited or de novo mutations, and the estimated preva- lence is 1 case per 15,000 to 20,000 persons. There are two types of FSHD, which are pheno- typically indistinguishable. FSHD type 1 accounts for 95% of cases of FSHD and is caused by a\ncontraction of the subtelomeric D4Z4 macrosat- ellite repeats on chromosome 4q35 in the pres- ence of a permissive A allele. FSHD type 2 ac- counts for the other 5% of cases and is caused\n \nby a mutation in SMCHD1 (the gene that encodes the structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain\u2013containing protein 1) on chromosome 18p11.32 in the presence of a per- missive A allele. Both genetic defects lead to chromatin relaxation (hypomethylation) of the permissive A allele in the D4Z4 region and result in expression of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) protein, which is thought to be toxic (Fig. 2).18-23 DUX4 protein expression is a  molecular  target for FSHD therapies that are currently being in- vestigated.\nIn patients with FSHD, the progression of muscle weakness usually follows a descending pattern, with weakness starting in facial mus- cles and then progressing to sequentially involve periscapular muscles, humeral muscles, abdom- inal and hip-girdle muscles, and finally distal muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg. Facial muscle weakness is often unnoticed, and the most common presenting symptom is diffi- culty with lifting objects above the shoulder, which usually occurs in the second or third de- cade of life. However, in some patients who do not have jobs or hobbies that are physically de- manding, weakness of the shoulder-girdle mus- cles is unnoticed, even for decades, because of the absence of symptoms or compensation for symptoms. Such patients present later in life, when weakness of the distal leg muscles devel- ops, as was seen in this case.23-25\nAlthough muscle weakness usually progress-\nes slowly in patients with FSHD, periods of sta- bility can be interrupted by periods of rapid de- terioration of specific muscle groups. The trigger of these unexpected phases of decline is uncer- tain.24-26 I suspect that this patient\u2019s 5-year his- tory of relatively rapid progression of left foot drop corresponds to a period of rapid deteriora- tion of the muscles of the anterior compartment of the left leg, which interrupted the stability of his lifelong asymptomatic muscle weakness.\nTo determine whether this patient had long- standing muscle weakness that may have been unnoticed when he was younger, I would ask him whether he has ever kept his eyes partially open during sleep or had difficulty with whistling or drinking through a straw, lifting objects over his shoulders (e.g., reaching top cabinets), or perform- ing abdominal crunches. In addition, I would look for horizontal axillary folds and Beevor\u2019s sign (upward deviation of the umbilicus on truncal flexion while the patient is in a supine posi- tion),27 which are manifestations of weakness in the pectoralis and abdominal muscles, respective- ly; these findings are not specific for FSHD but are typically seen in patients with this condition. \nThe next steps would be to provide genetic counseling and obtain consent for genetic test- ing for FSHD type 1. If testing for FSHD type 1 is negative, I would then test for FSHD type 2. In parallel, I would obtain repeat EMG studies to look for evidence of a superimposed L5 radicu- lopathy.\nThe decrease in vibratory and pinprick sensa- tions in the distal legs would not be explained  by FSHD. I suspect that these findings corre- spond to a subclinical length-dependent sensory polyneuropathy that may be related to his alco- hol use and is unrelated to his muscle weakness.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Reza Sadjadi: Electrodiagnostic studies, includ- ing nerve-conduction studies and EMG, were performed. The results of nerve-conduction studies recorded from the tibialis anterior mus- cle were notable for asymmetrically low ampli- tude of the motor response in the left common peroneal nerve. The differential diagnosis for this pattern, in conjunction with a relatively pre- served sensory response in the superficial pero- neal nerve, includes preganglionic neurogenic processes (typically L5 radiculopathy), neuro- muscular-junction disorders (myasthenia), and myopathic processes. In addition, in patients with acute peripheral nerve injury (i.e., peroneal neuropathy), Wallerian degeneration of the mo- tor fibers precedes that of the sensory fibers by a few days. Therefore, trauma to the peroneal nerve that occurred within 10 days before the nerve-conduction studies could explain normal sensory responses with low-amplitude motor responses.28,29\nEMG  can  help  in  differentiating  between a primarily neurogenic process and a myopathic process (Fig. 3).32 In patients with a neurogenic process, reduced recruitment of motor-unit ac- tion potentials (with long duration and high amplitude) reflects the increased number of mus- cle fibers per functioning motor unit.33 By con- trast, in patients with a myopathic process, early recruitment of motor-unit action potentials (with short duration and low amplitude) reflects the decreased size and number of functional muscle fibers per motor unit.34 EMG results re- corded from the tibialis anterior muscle in this patient were supportive of a myopathic process. Given the clinical phenotype and electrodiag- nostic  findings,  targeted  genetic  testing was performed. There was a contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats on chromosome 4q35 lead- ing to DUX4 protein expression, a finding con- sistent with FSHD type 1.35 The patient con- firmed long-standing difficulty with raising his right arm above his shoulder, whistling, and sipping through straws.\n",
