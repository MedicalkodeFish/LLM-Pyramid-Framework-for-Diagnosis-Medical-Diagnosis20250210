    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Hung M. Le (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old girl was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital because of headache, dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, irritability, and difficulties with sleep and concentration after she had head trauma during a sailboat race.\nThe patient had been well until 11 days before this evaluation, when she was racing in a regatta and was struck in the head by the boom of another team\u2019s boat. On collision, her team\u2019s boat capsized. The patient was reportedly dazed and con- fused, but she was assisted back into the boat by her teammates and they contin- ued to sail. Shortly thereafter, the weather became windy and the patient and her teammates were again knocked out of the boat. The patient reportedly lost con- sciousness for several minutes; it was suspected but not confirmed that she had been hit by the boom of her team\u2019s boat. She was rescued and brought to shore. On arrival of emergency medical services personnel, she was awake and talking but confused. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department at another hospital. During the ambulance ride, she was agitated and resisted care. In the emergency department, the patient reported that she felt confused, dizzy, and unsteady and had a headache. The results of a neurologic examination and an examination of the neck were reportedly normal, as were radiographs of the cervical spine. Rest and observation were recommended, and the patient was discharged\nhome in the care of her parents.\nEleven days later, the patient was seen in the sports concussion clinic at this hospital. She did not remember the sailing accident or the subsequent ambulance ride. Since discharge, she had been resting at home with limited activity and stimulation. She had occasional frontotemporal headaches with sharp pain, which she rated at 3 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. She also reported dizziness, balance problems, fatigue, and difficulty sleeping. The patient noted that she had had difficulty concentrating on her summer reading assignment and could not read a full page with- out losing focus, although she could read less challenging material for 15-to-20-minute inter- vals. Reading precipitated headaches. She report- ed that she felt irritable and impatient with hav- ing to stay home and that her symptoms decreased with activity.\nThe patient had a history of several sports- related injuries. When she was 13 years of age, she had a concussion without loss of conscious- ness after being hit in the head with a paddle- board. After that injury, she was dizzy for sev- eral days and had headaches for 3 months. The patient took no medications and had no known allergies. She lived with her parents and brother in a suburban area of New England and was an excellent student. Her brother had attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). There was no family history of headaches, learning disabili- ties, depression, anxiety, or seizure disorders.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and answered questions appropriately. On a mental- status examination, orientation, immediate and delayed recall, attention, and language were in- tact. The neck was not tender and had a full range of motion. Cranial nerves II through XII were normal, and there was no nystagmus. Photo- phobia was present, and there was pain with upward gaze; the near point of convergence was 15 cm. Both nodding and side-to-side movements of the head caused dizziness. On a Romberg test, the patient swayed mildly when she stood with her feet together and eyes closed. There were mild difficulties with double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stance on a hard surface. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\n\nClinical Course:\nDr. Le: Two days after the evaluation in the sports concussion clinic, the patient\u2019s father called the clinic. He reported that the patient disclosed that she had been having nosebleeds lasting ap- proximately 15 minutes every morning since the accident; she had not mentioned the nosebleeds previously because she was not sure that they were important. When questioned further, the patient reported that thin, clear fluid had drained from her nose on the day after she had been seen in the clinic, but no further drainage of clear fluid had occurred. She was referred to the emergency department at this hospital for fur- ther evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re-\nported that the bleeding had come predominant- ly from the right nostril and had abated with the application of pinching pressure to the nose. She had had infrequent nosebleeds in the past and did not have bleeding gums or heavy menstrual bleeding. On examination, there was dried blood in the right nostril; the remainder of the exami- nation was unchanged. The complete blood count, prothrombin time, and activated partial-thrombo- plastin time were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, urea nitrogen, creatinine, factor VIII, ristocetin cofactor, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen. A urine preg- nancy test was negative.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mary A. Iaccarino: I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. This 16-year-old girl with a history of one previous concussion presented to the sports concussion clinic at this hospital 11 days after a sailing accident. She had lost consciousness for a few minutes and had had amnesia for several hours after the event, and her symptoms included dizziness, confusion, unsteady gait, and head- ache; a diagnosis of concussion was made. Concussion is a transient neurologic disturbance that occurs after a blow to the head or body or a quick head motion (acceleration or decelera- tion event), and it produces a range of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms.1 Concussion is a form of mild traumatic brain injury, which is associated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score at initial presentation of no less than 13 (on a scale of 3 to 15, with lower scores indicating greater alteration of consciousness), loss of conscious- ness lasting no longer than 30 minutes, post- traumatic amnesia lasting no longer than 24 hours, and the absence of intracranial abnormalities on conventional computed tomography (CT) or mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI).2\nYoung athletes, like this patient, have a high\nrisk of head injury, with 1.8 million to 3.6 mil- lion sports-related concussions occurring each year.3 Through athletic contact, the brain is ex- posed directly or indirectly to linear and trans- lational acceleration\u2013deceleration forces that dis- rupt normal brain function. One of the primary pathophysiological features of acute concussion, although not fully understood, is described as a cellular neurometabolic derangement in which ion f luctuations and the release of glutamate across neuronal membranes deplete energy stores, resulting in axonal injury and altered neu- rotransmission.4 Usually, normal cellular neuro- metabolic activity resumes within 1 to 2 weeks after acute concussion and is associated with clinical improvement.\nThis patient was approaching the  2-week\nmark after injury and had persistent symptoms that interfered with school and sports. The re- sults of a gross neurologic examination were normal, but she had subtle findings of impaired static and dynamic balance, discomfort with head motions that stress the vestibular and ocu- lar systems, visual pursuit movements that were not smooth, and an impaired near point of convergence. The in-office evaluation of patients with acute concussion consists of an assessment of symptoms (typically with the use of the Post- Concussion Symptom Scale), a neurologic and cervical-spine examination, balance testing (with the use of the Balance Error Scoring System), vestibular and ocular motor screening, and brief neurocognitive testing.5\nConcussion is a broad diagnosis with variable features; certain signs and symptoms of concussion may cluster and predominate to form spe- cific concussive phenotypes.6 In this case, the symptoms of dizziness and imbalance and the examination findings of poor static and dynamic balance and symptom exacerbation with vestibu- lar and ocular reflex testing are consistent with a vestibular and ocular concussion phenotype.\n",
