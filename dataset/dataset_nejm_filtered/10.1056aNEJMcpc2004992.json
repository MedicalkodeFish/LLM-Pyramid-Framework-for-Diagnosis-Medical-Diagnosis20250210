    "Primary Symptom": "A 69-Year-Old Man with Ataxia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Claudio M. de Gusmao: A 69-year-old man was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital because of progressively worsening ataxia.\nThe patient had been well until 9 years before this evaluation, when abnormal gait and impaired coordination developed. He was unable to walk in a straight line; he bumped into walls when walking down a hallway. He also had difficulty reading traffic signs while driving and noted a change in the quality of his voice. The patient was evaluated at the neurology clinic of another hospital and began physical therapy.\nDuring the next several years, symptoms gradually worsened despite physical therapy. The patient was no longer able to drive or play golf, and he intermittently used a walker because of unsteadiness. He had frequent falls, including one that led to fractures in six ribs. His speech changes worsened, such that he could no longer sing. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the neurology clinic, the patient reported frequent bowel movements, ap- proximately 10 per day. He had no vertigo, lightheadedness, hearing loss, tremor, erectile dysfunction, disturbance of sleep, or urinary incontinence. He reported a sense of visual disorientation with head movement and with changes in the direction of gaze. He had a history of hyperlipidemia. Medications included atorvastatin, cetirizine, and a multivitamin; there were no known drug allergies. The patient had recently moved from an urban area in the southeastern United States to a suburban area of New England. He drank one glass of wine nightly; additional alcohol use caused worsening of ataxia and dysarthria. He had previously smoked five cigarettes daily but had quit smoking 30 years before this evaluation; he did not use illicit drugs.\nThe patient\u2019s mother had died of heart failure at an elderly age, and his father had died after a stroke and myocardial infarction at 70 years of age. The patient had two adult children, who were healthy. His two brothers and one of his sisters had celiac disease; the sister also reportedly had a shuffling gait. The sister\u2019s daughter had received a diagnosis of Turner\u2019s syndrome and had been seen by a neurologist for a balance disturbance. A brother\u2019s grandson also had celiac disease and a gait disturbance (Fig. 1).\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pres- sure 136/88 mm Hg, and the pulse 72 beats per minute. The patient was alert, oriented, and at- tentive and provided a detailed history. He had moderate dysarthria, with impairment in the rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech. An oculomotor examination revealed complete and conjugate gaze in all directions; he had intact smooth pur- suit movements but had slow, dysmetric saccades. Results of a head impulse test were abnormal, with corrective saccades noted bilaterally. Normal tone and full strength were present in all major muscle groups of the arms and legs. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric at the knees but absent at the ankles. Plantar responses were flexor bi- laterally. Rapid tapping of the index fingers on the thumbs was dysrhythmic and uncoordinated. Finger\u2013nose\u2013finger testing revealed mild inten- tion tremor. Heel-to-shin testing revealed sym- metric jerking movements with lateral movements across the shins. Vibration and joint-position senses in the legs were profoundly decreased: the patient was unable to sense vibration at the toes, had a decreased ability to sense vibration at the knees, and had difficulty discerning the po- sition of his big toe with his eyes closed. There was sway in his stance, regardless of whether his eyes were open, and he could not stand with the feet together. The patient walked without support. He had a wide-based gait with consid- erable staggering and jerky, stiff movements of the legs. He was unable to maintain balance in a tandem stance or to walk with a tandem gait. The complete blood count and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were test results for kidney, liver, and thyroid function; antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin were not detected. Blood levels of cyanocobalamin, methyl- malonic acid, vitamin E, and glycated hemoglobin were normal; anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and tissue transglutaminase antibod- ies were not detected. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Genetic testing revealed no mutations in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8. Clinical testing of otolith function revealed ab- normal vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials on the left side. Nerve-conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bi- lateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve. Results of motor nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were results of a modi- fied barium-swallow evaluation. A previous work- up at another hospital for chronic diarrhea had reportedly been normal, with no evidence of\nmalabsorption.\nDr. McKinley Glover: Magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) of the head (Fig. 2), performed with- out the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed mild diffuse parenchymal vol- ume loss and prominent cerebellar volume loss, most notably involving the vermis and superior cerebellar hemispheres. There was mild flatten- ing of the superior margin of the midbrain, and the ratio of midbrain to ventral pons was mildly reduced at 0.51 (reference range, >0.52).1 The anteroposterior diameter of the midbrain was\n8.90 mm (reference range, >9.35).1 There was no abnormal signal in the pons, and the middle cerebellar peduncles were normal. There was a chronic lacunar infarct of the right thalamus.\n\nFigure 2. MRI of the Head.\nAn axial T2\u2011weighted image (Panel A) and an axial fluid\u2011attenuated inversion recovery image (Panel B) obtained at the level of the middle cerebellar peduncles show moderate cerebellar volume loss without focal signal abnormality. A sagittal T1\u2011weighted image (Panel C) shows moderate volume loss in the superior vermis, mild flattening of the superior margin of the midbrain, and a ratio of midbrain to ventral pons of 0.51. A parasagittal T1\u2011weighted image (Panel D) shows moderate volume loss in the cerebellar hemispheres, predominantly the superior aspects.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Vikram Khurana: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. The first step in developing a differen- tial diagnosis for this patient with ataxia and balance abnormalities is to carefully consider the anatomical localization and time course of his disorder.\nAnatomical Localization\nBalance, gait, and posture are dependent on three types of sensory inputs: proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual inputs. The integrator of these inputs is the cerebellum.\nThis patient\u2019s balance was affected because of impairment in multiple systems. There was a striking loss of proprioception in the legs. Nerve- conduction studies revealed absent or barely detectable responses in the bilateral sural nerves, left superficial peroneal nerve, left median nerve, left ulnar nerve, and right radial nerve, findings that suggest a non\u2013length-dependent sensory ab- normality, such as dorsal root ganglionopathy. In addition, the head impulse test was positive bidirectionally, which suggests additional involve- ment of the vestibular system. Finally, there was evidence of impairment in cerebellar function, with cerebellar dysarthria (disordered rate, rhythm, and clarity of speech) and ocular dysmetria.\n\nTime Course\nThe differential diagnosis can be narrowed by considering the temporal development of the symptoms. The 9-year time course of this pa- tient\u2019s illness rules out acute causes, such as vascular, infectious, parainfectious, and toxic metabolic processes. The timing is also not a good match for subacute causes, such as inflam- matory and infiltrating diseases, paraneoplastic diseases, nutritional diseases, or prionopathies. In rare cases, mutations in PRNP can cause an atypical prionopathy with slowly progressive ataxia, diarrhea, and neuropathy,2 but this pa- tient did not have associated features such as cognitive decline or seizures. The prolonged his- tory of symptoms in this patient is most consis- tent with a chronic degenerative ataxia.\nChronic degenerative ataxias can be classified according to whether there is a known or an unknown cause.3 In this patient, the presence of a sensory neuropathy allows for further differen- tiation (Table 1).\n\nChronic Degenerative Ataxias\nFriedreich\u2019s Ataxia\nChronic degenerative ataxias associated with sensory neuropathy that have a known cause are predominantly genetic disorders. The most com- mon is Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, a multisystem autoso- mal recessive disorder associated with dorsal root ganglionopathy and cerebellar dysfunction. There are rare case reports of patients with a very late onset of Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, in whom symptoms developed after 40 years of age.5 Among patients with late-onset disease, there may be a decreased incidence of typical features, such as areflexia, cardiomyopathy, and scoliosis. Genetic testing can be performed to evaluate for this condition.\n\nNutritional Deficiencies\nThe presence of a normal vitamin E level can rule out ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. This condition was considered in this patient because of his history of chronic diarrhea, although his previous workup for diarrhea had not revealed malabsorption. There was no history of excessive alcohol intake, nutritional deficiency, or mental status changes that would suggest Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy or alcohol-related cerebellar de- generation.\n \n\nCeliac Disease\nThis patient has a strong family history of celiac disease, which suggests the possibility of gluten ataxia, a controversial diagnosis that is loosely defined as ataxia associated with positive sero- logic tests for celiac disease (i.e., tests for IgA to gliadin and IgA or IgG to tissue transglutamin- ase).6 Gluten ataxia classically causes gait and appendicular ataxia in conjunction with a large- fiber sensory neuropathy. The gluten trigger has been questioned because gluten ataxia can occur in the absence of enteropathy, and there are mixed reports regarding the efficacy of a gluten- free diet. Nevertheless, there are reports of cross- reactivity of the gluten antibodies with cerebellar antigens, and patients with \u201csporadic\u201d cerebellar ataxia have a higher frequency of positive sero- logic tests for celiac disease than control popu- lations in some studies.6 Gluten ataxia remains a consideration in this case, although the poor correlation between ataxia and celiac disease in his family makes this an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nOther Genetic Ataxias\nSensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and oph- thalmoparesis (SANDO) is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts mitochondrial function and can sometimes develop later in life.7 SANDO is a possible diagnosis in this patient because he had ganglionopathy, ataxia, and dysarthria. However, he did not have other characteristic fea- tures of SANDO, specifically ophthalmoparesis and episodic symptoms including seizures, mi- graines, and myoclonus.\nThis patient does not have a family history of an autosomal dominant ataxia, so he is unlikely to have one of these disorders, which include some of the most prevalent spinocerebellar atax- ias associated with peripheral neuropathy (types 1, 2, 3, and 6).8 Furthermore, genetic testing for these spinocerebellar ataxias was negative. His age at symptom onset and clinical features are not consistent with other hereditary ataxias asso- ciated with neuropathy, including two autoso- mal recessive disorders, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia and ataxia telangiectasia.\n\nMultiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy\nChronic degenerative ataxias that have an un- known or poorly defined cause are considera- tions in this case. Two types have well-defined neuropathological features. Multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type (MSA-C) is an \u03b1-synucleinopathy characterized by the accumu- lation of misfolded \u03b1-synuclein in oligodendro- cytes.9 Dysarthria is a common feature, but other characteristic features, including early autonom- ic dysfunction and concomitant parkinsonism, are absent in this patient. The cerebellar variant of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP-C) is a tauopathy characterized by the accumulation of misfolded tau in neurons and glia.10 This rare disorder typically manifests as frontotemporal dysfunction and parkinsonism. Of note, the cardinal feature of progressive supranuclear palsy\u2014 supranuclear gaze palsy \u2014 may not be pres- ent initially or, in rare cases, may never develop in patients with the cerebellar variant.11-13 On imaging studies, PSP-C is associated with disproportionate atrophy of the midbrain as compared with the pons, whereas MSA-C is associ- ated with atrophy of the pons and middle cerebellar peduncles.1 PSP-C, like MSA-C, can be associated with dysarthria and spasticity. PSP-C can also be associated with prominent falls and a jerky and stiff gait, which were present in this patient. However, sensory neuropathy is not char- acteristic of either disorder, nor is vestibulopathy.\n\nCerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy, and Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome\nWhen I evaluated this patient, a new syndrome had recently been described, comprising pro- gressive cerebellar ataxia, peripheral vestibular dysfunction, and the absence of sensory nerve action potentials, which suggests a non\u2013length- dependent sensory deficit. By that time, the syn- drome was named cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS).14 Patients with CANVAS were described as having marked sensory ganglionopathy affecting dorsal root ganglia and vestibular, trigeminal, and fa- cial ganglion cells, along with Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.15,16 More recent data confirmed a loss of large and small myelinated fibers with- out active axonal degeneration.17 Video oculogra- phy was described as the method of choice for the detection of both the abnormal vestibulo- ocular reflex with corrective saccades and the deficient smooth pursuit movements and opto- kinetic responses bilaterally. Other features de- scribed in association with this syndrome in- cluded chronic cough, oscillopsia, dysesthesia, dysphagia, and orthostatic hypotension. Although the cause of CANVAS was unknown at that time, an early report describing two pairs of affected siblings had suggested the possibility of autoso- mal recessive inheritance.14\nIn this patient with the triad of cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and bilateral vestibular dys- function, the clinical syndrome of CANVAS is the most likely diagnosis. Given the patient\u2019s family history of a shuffling gait and celiac dis- ease, immune and genetic causes of this syn- drome should be ruled out.\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. de Gusmao: At this hospital, the patient was initially treated with varenicline, which was sub- sequently discontinued because apathy and night- mares developed. During the next 3 years, the gait and coordination impairments, dysarthria, and dysphagia worsened in severity. The patient became dependent on a walker and then required a wheelchair. MRI of the head performed 2 years after the initial study did not reveal any radiographically significant changes in cerebel- lar volume loss; concurrent MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine revealed degenerative disk disease without a signal change in the spinal cord. Cough, progressive diplopia, generalized muscle cramping, increased urinary frequency, and spas- ticity in the legs developed, as did mild weak- ness in the right leg. There was slowing of sac- cades despite full excursions of eye movements in all directions. A modified barium-swallow evaluation revealed a new impairment of the swallow reflex.\nAdditional genetic testing did not reveal any pathogenic mutations or repeat expansions in the genes FXN, POLG1, APTX, SETX, TTPA, and SIL1 or in mitochondrial genes associated with the dis- orders MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged- red fibers), NARP (neuropathy, ataxia, and reti- nitis pigmentosa), and MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke- like episodes). Further genetic testing was nega- tive, including testing for pathogenic mutations or repeat expansions in genes associated with spinocerebellar ataxia types 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, and 17 and with DRPLA (dentatorubral\u2013pallidoluysian atrophy). Whole-exome sequencing of the patient, his niece, and his grandnephew did not reveal any candidate variants.\nRepeat testing for serum IgA to gliadin and tissue transglutaminase revealed mildly elevated titers. Gluten was eliminated from the diet, but there was no improvement in neurologic symp- toms. Intravenous immune globulin was admin- istered, and there was possible improvement in the strength of the right leg; however, therapy was stopped after 3 months because there was no decrease in ataxia. Treatment with riluzole was started.\nApproximately 4 years after the initial presen- tation to this hospital and 13 years after the development of ataxia, the patient fell at home and was admitted to another hospital. He received a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Because of his overall neurologic decline, the patient and his family elected to redirect care to comfort measures. The patient died 3 weeks after hospice care was initiated. At the time of death, the fam- ily granted permission for an autopsy limited to the brain and spinal cord.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Helgager: Gross neuropathological exami- nation of the brain was notable for marked atro- phy of the cerebellum, most prominent in the superior aspect of the cerebellar vermis, as well as of the subthalamic nucleus. The substantia nigra was markedly pale, as was the locus ce- ruleus.\nOn histologic examination (Fig. 3), there was severe global loss of Purkinje neurons through- out both the vermis and the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. The subthalamic nucleus and cere- bellar dentate nucleus had evidence of gliosis and neuron loss. The substantia nigra and locus ceruleus had marked depletion of neurons. Im- munohistochemical staining for tau and phos- phorylated tau showed globose neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads within these two structures; neuronal and neuritic tau tangles and glial tau deposition were also detected through- out the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus palli- dus, and subthalamic nucleus. Infrequent tau- immunoreactive threads were present in the cerebellar white matter. There was no evidence of Lewy bodies or other \u03b1-synuclein disorders on immunohistochemical staining. Immunohisto- chemical staining for \u03b2-amyloid and p62 was negative, whereas TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) was present in a normal distribution. There were no ubiquitin-positive cerebellar in- clusions. Immunohistochemical staining with the use of an anti\u2013polyglutamine-expansion dis- eases marker antibody (1C2) was also negative. Sections of sural nerve showed mild depletion of large myelinated axons, and examination of latissimus dorsi muscle revealed marked varia- tion in fiber size with numerous atrophic fibers, findings consistent with neurogenic atrophy. Examination of the spinal cord revealed mild axonal loss in sensory and motor tracts.\nOverall, the neuropathological findings were consistent with cerebellar degeneration and an accompanying multisystem tauopathy. The cere- bellar atrophy and loss of Purkinje neurons are consistent with findings previously described with CANVAS.16 However, the neurodegenerative changes observed in the brain stem, cerebellar dentate nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus, along with the anatomical and cellular distribution of the multisystem tauopathy, are most reminiscent of progressive supranuclear  palsy.  Degeneration of the cerebellar cortex is not a feature typically seen in patients with a pathological diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy, and it does not appear to be a prominent feature on neuropathological examination in patients with the cerebellar variant (PSP-C).9,10,13 Autopsy studies have not reported tauopathy as a component of CANVAS, but these studies are limited in number and scope and may not reflect all the neuropatho- logical manifestations of the disease.\n\nFigure 4. Results of Diagnostic Testing for CANVAS.\nShown are the results of a repeat\u2011primed polymerase\u2011chain\u2011reaction (PCR) analysis for the detection of a mutation associated with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS). A 5\u2032 fluorescently tagged primer at the gene locus preceding the repeat expansion (flanking primer; arrow pointing to the right) is used in conjunction with a 3\u2032 primer designed to detect the pathologic repeat expansion (repeat primer; arrows pointing to the left). Fluorescence quantitation yields a \u201cladder,\u201d which oc\u2011 curs when the repeat primer binds to complementary sequences at different positions along the repeat expansion, resulting in a family of PCR products. This technique identifies the presence of at least one expanded repeat but can provide only an estimate of the actual repeat size. The efficiency is higher for shorter repeats, which explains the higher peaks on the left side. A positive result is confirmed by conventional PCR analysis that shows the absence of any normal\u2011sized gene products in the patient (not shown), in\u2011 dicating that the expansion is biallelic. In this case, the test was performed by the team of Dr. Brent Fogel at the University of California, Los Angeles.20\n\nDr. de Gusmao: In 2019, two different groups dis- covered that many cases of CANVAS were caused by biallelic expansions of a gene not previously associated with disease, RFC1.18,19 In conducting genetic analyses in families that had two or more members with the CANVAS phenotype, both groups combined linkage analysis with next-generation sequencing. After identifying the suspected locus, the groups then adopted different bioinformatic and laboratory-based strategies to detect the expanded mutation.\nRFC1 is located on chromosome 4p14. In in- tron 2 of RFC1, there is a repeat stretch of five base pairs (a pentanucleotide). This is referred to as a short tandem repeat. The normal allele con- sists of a pentanucleotide of four adenine bases and one guanine base that repeats 11 times: (AAAAG)11. The investigators found that patients with CANVAS had biallelic expansions of a mutated sequence, such that most patients had 400 to 2000 repeats of a pentanucleotide of two ad- enine bases and three guanine bases: (AAGGG)N.We sent a sample of this patient\u2019s DNA  to colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, for analysis of the repeat expansion. Using a combined approach that included long- range and repeat-primed polymerase-chain-reac- tion (PCR) analysis, they found that the normal allele was absent and at least one expanded allele was present; the findings were highly suggestive of a biallelic expansion in RFC1 (Fig. 4). The patient\u2019s niece and grandnephew were found to be heterozygous carriers, with one expanded al- lele and one normal allele.\nAlthough it has been estimated that 85% of disease-causing mutations reside within coding sequences of the genome, the accuracy of this estimate has been called into question.20 The RFC1 mutation is a repeat expansion in the non- coding region of the genome and thus was not identified by clinical whole-exome sequencing in this patient. Failing to arrive at a conclusive ge- netic diagnosis is not uncommon: variants are identified in approximately 50% of patients with suspected genetic ataxia who undergo whole- exome sequencing, and only half these variants are classified as causative (i.e., pathogenic or likely pathogenic), with the remainder classified as variants of unknown significance.21 Whole- exome sequencing cannot identify repeat expan- sions or the intronic mutations or structural genetic changes that occur with intact chromosomal DNA sequences (e.g., copy-number varia- tions, aneuploidy, or balanced translocations). Finally, mutations in mitochondrial DNA require separate analyses.\nWhole-genome sequencing is a promising tool to clear these \u201cblind spots,\u201d allowing for the potential identification of mutations in noncod- ing regions, as well as copy-number variants. Repeat expansions such as the one found in this patient are more challenging to identify, requiring clinical assessment with arduous site-specific PCR analysis, although bioinformatic tools are emerging that will help to identify them with whole-genome sequencing.19\nAs we obtain more genetic data from our patients, the challenge of identifying variants that are relevant and cause disease will become more pressing. Both rigorous clinical phenotyp- ing and the development of biologic tools that can stratify variants of unknown significance are likely to play a critical role in this effort.\nDr. Khurana: In this case, the identification of a recently described noncoding genetic lesion pinned down a specific genetic cause of CANVAS. RFC1- related ataxia should be considered in patients with a sensory ataxic neuropathy, especially when there are associated features of CANVAS such as vestibular and cerebellar dysfunction and chronic cough.17 Future molecular genetic studies may shed light on the causative gene product and the implications of a heterozygous carrier state. The previously unreported finding of a tauopathy further underscores that additional neuropathological examination in patients with molecularly defined CANVAS will be important in defining the range of underlying neuropatho- logical features of the disease. Discovery of the genetic lesion has thus paved the way for sys- tematic histopathological studies and a logical path toward disease modeling and therapy.\n",
