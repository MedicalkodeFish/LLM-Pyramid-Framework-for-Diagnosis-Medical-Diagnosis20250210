    "Primary Symptom": "A 37-Year-Old Man with Joint Pain and Eye Redness",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. John H. Stone: A 37-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for joint pain and rash.\nThe patient had been well until 2 years before this evaluation, when intermit- tent arthralgias developed in the joints of the hands. Four months before presenta- tion, the pain in the hands became more severe, and new joint pain developed in the wrists, knees, ankles, and shoulders. He had occasional joint stiffness, most commonly in the morning. The patient was evaluated by his primary care physi- cian. The blood levels of electrolytes were reportedly normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests, the complete blood count, and the erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate. A screening test for Lyme disease was reportedly negative. Despite the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the joint arthralgias did not abate, and the patient was referred to the rheumatology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, the patient reported the new development of a rash on his hands and feet, as well as pain in his calves that worsened after prolonged standing. He had no fever, chills, night sweats, weakness, chest pain, or shortness of breath. On examination, several small, nonblanching, petechial lesions were noted on the hands and feet, and four slightly raised, erythematous lesions were seen on the hands and left lower leg. He had tenderness in the wrists, metacarpo- phalangeal joints, ankles, and metatarsophalangeal joints, as well as pain with motion of the hips and knees. The muscles of the calves were firm and tender on palpation. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count and differential count were normal. Blood tests for rheuma- toid factor and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 11), and the C-reactive protein level was 58 mg per liter (reference value, <8). Blood tests were positive for antinuclear antibodies at titers of 1:40 and 1:160, with a speckled pattern. Hydroxychloroquine and prednisone were prescribed. However, during the next week, the patient had difficulty walking owing to progressively worsening calf pain, and he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported dry mouth and weight loss of 9 kg over a period of 2 months that he attributed to changes in diet and exercise. Two days before presenta- tion, he had noted redness and mild pain in both eyes but no blurred vision. Five days before pre- sentation, his temperature measured at home had been 37.9\u00b0C. His medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and gastro- esophageal reflux disease, which had resulted in a stricture that required balloon dilation of the distal esophagus. Twenty-two months before this presentation, mild elevations in alanine amino- transferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels detected during routine laboratory testing had been attributed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. He had had multiple previous tick bites and had been treated empirically with doxycycline in the past, most recently 14 months before presenta- tion. Medications were hydroxychloroquine, pred- nisone, omeprazole, ergocalciferol, alprazolam, a multivitamin, and glucosamine. The patient did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs; he drank alcohol occasionally. He was married with two children and lived in a suburb of Boston. He worked as an executive in a local firm. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pressure 146/88 mm Hg, the pulse 89 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Diffuse conjunctival injection affecting the epi- scleral vessels was present in both eyes, and a violaceous hue was noted in the underlying sclera (Fig. 1A). The patient was able to stand from a seated position without the use of his hands, but ambulation was difficult because of pain in the calves. The calves appeared swollen, without erythema or warmth, and were firm and tender on palpation. There was pain on flexion and extension of the right great toe, with no erythema, warmth, or swelling of the joints. Erythematous papules were present on the left wrist, the left olecranon (Fig. 1B), and the right olecranon. Several erythematous lesions were noted on the left lower leg and right foot (Fig. 1C and 1D) and on the hands; they were not raised and did not blanch with pressure. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood (reference value, negative), 1+ protein (reference value, negative), 50 to 100 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2), and 5 to 10 white cells per high-power field (refer- ence range, 0 to 2). Examination of the urine sediment revealed dysmorphic red cells and red- cell casts that were too numerous to count. Blood tests for anti\u2013double-stranded DNA anti- body, anti-Ro antibody, and anti-La antibody were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies of the left leg were obtained.\nDr. Ambrose J. Huang: Magnetic resonance im-\naging (MRI) of the left lower leg (Fig. 2), per- formed before and after the administration of intravenous gadolinium-based contrast material, revealed nonspecific, diffuse muscle edema, which was most prominent in the posterior com- partment of the calf, with mild associated con- trast enhancement. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy, myonecrosis, bony involvement, or drainable fluid collections.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Images.\nImages were obtained during the initial evaluation at this hospital.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lucia Sobrin: This 37-year-old man presents with redness in both eyes and a systemic illness that has resulted in rash, arthralgias, swelling and pain in the calf, hematuria, proteinuria, and red-cell casts in the urine. Can a differential diagnosis be constructed on the basis of the findings involving this patient\u2019s eyes?\n\nRedness of the Eyes\nThe patient noted redness and mild pain in both eyes, without blurred vision. The first step in evaluating a patient with eye redness is to deter- mine which layer of the eye is inflamed. Con- junctivitis is a common cause of eye redness that is usually due to infection, allergy, or dry eyes. Eye redness can also be caused by inflammation of the superficial or deep episcleral vascular network (episcleritis or scleritis, respectively), the cornea (keratitis), or the uveal tract (uveitis). Which layer of this patient\u2019s eye is affected?\nThe degree of eye pain is most consistent with conjunctivitis or episcleritis, in which mild pain is common. Patients with scleritis, keratitis, or uveitis typically have more severe eye pain. How- ever, neither conjunctivitis nor episcleritis is com- monly associated with systemic disease, and there- fore, it is unlikely that either of these diagnoses would account for all the features of this case.\nThe physical examination is critical in local- izing which layer of the eye is inflamed. It is important to initially examine the patient in natural light, since subtle changes in color are often best observed this way. In patients with conjunctivitis, episcleritis, keratitis, or uveitis, the eye is typically just red. In patients with scleritis, the eye can also have a violaceous hue, which is due to scleral edema. With repeated attacks of scleritis, the sclera can become thin- ner and more translucent, allowing the darker underlying uvea to show through the sclera, re- sulting in a grayish-blue tinge.\nTwo other findings on physical examination\ncan help to distinguish episcleritis from scleritis. In patients with episcleritis, congested vessels follow a radial pattern, whereas scleritis is often characterized by more of a crisscross pattern. In patients with episcleritis, instillation of phenyl- ephrine drops causes congested superficial epi- scleral vessels to vasoconstrict completely, result- ing in a white appearance of the eye. In patients with scleritis, congested deep episcleral vessels do not vasoconstrict completely, leading to per- sistent congestion and redness after instillation of phenylephrine. Although these findings can help to differentiate episcleritis from scleritis, the use of slit-lamp examination to directly ex- amine the episclera and sclera is the best way to distinguish these two entities.\nAlthough we do not have information from a slit-lamp examination to definitively determine the presence of scleral edema, the violaceous hue of the sclera on general examination makes scleritis the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s eye redness. Scleritis can appear as an isolated find- ing or can be accompanied by other ocular manifestations. A slit-lamp examination or di- lated fundus examination would be required to determine whether there were corneal findings or evidence of intraocular inflammation that would indicate concurrent keratitis or uveitis.\nScleritis is classified on the basis of clinical appearance at presentation. I would classify this patient\u2019s presentation as anterior diffuse scleri- tis, given the violaceous hue of the sclera and the presence of diffuse conjunctival injection. The absence of a scleral nodule makes anterior nodu- lar scleritis unlikely. Similarly, there was no de- scription of scleral thinning that would suggest necrotizing scleritis.\nThe underlying cause of scleritis is sometimes unknown, or the condition can be associated with systemic immune-mediated diseases, local or systemic infections, or medications. This patient is not taking any medications, such as a bisphos- phonate, that would typically cause scleritis, but he has several symptoms and signs suggestive of an associated underlying systemic disease. Up to half of all patients with scleritis have an as- sociated identifiable local or systemic disease,1,2 with approximately 40% of patients with scleri- tis having a noninfectious systemic disease and 5 to 10% having an infectious cause.3,4 Sometimes scleritis is the first manifestation of an underly- ing systemic illness, so it is always important to rule out commonly associated systemic diseases in all patients presenting with scleritis.\nInfectious Scleritis\nExogenous Infectious Scleritis\nInfectious scleritis can be categorized as exoge- nous or endogenous. Exogenous infectious scle- ritis is commonly caused by extension of infec- tion from a corneal ulcer or the introduction of a pathogenic organism related to trauma or sur- gery. This patient has no history suggestive of local introduction of infection, and exogenous causes of infectious scleritis would be unlikely to explain his systemic symptoms.\n\nEndogenous Infectious Scleritis\nSeveral systemic, endogenous infections are as- sociated with scleritis. Herpes zoster is one of the most common systemic infections with scler- al involvement, which can occur many months after resolution of dermatologic disease. How- ever, this patient had no existing or previous symptoms or signs of herpes zoster infection. Syphilis can cause scleritis and a wide range of systemic symptoms; however, this patient\u2019s rash does not resemble the reddish-brown papules that typically occur on the trunk, palms, and soles, and kidney involvement would be unusual\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Rosalynn M. Nazarian: A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen of a papule on the left elbow was ob- tained. Histopathological examination (Fig. 3) revealed a dermal palisading granuloma, com- posed of histiocytes surrounded by lymphocytes, with central collagen degeneration adjacent to the epidermal surface that indicated an area of perforation. Admixed multinucleated giant cells and neutrophils with leukocytoclasia (neutrophil nuclear degeneration) were present within the inflammatory infiltrate and necrobiotic collagen. Taken together, the findings were consistent with palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.\nClinically, palisaded neutrophilic and granu- lomatous dermatitis is most often characterized by multiple discrete erythematous papules or nod- ules symmetrically involving elbows and fingers in patients with systemic disease, including sys- temic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthri- tis, and systemic vasculitis.10 Classic histopatho- logic features are the presence of palisading granulomas with basophilic collagen necrobio- sis and interspersed neutrophils with leukocyto- clasia.10 The histologic differential diagnosis may include reaction to an insect bite, drug eruption, and infection. Palisaded neutrophilic and granu- lomatous dermatitis is thought to be part of a disease spectrum that includes rheumatoid nod- ule, necrobiosis lipoidica, and granuloma annu- lare, all of which are independently associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as ANCA- associated vasculitis and diabetes mellitus.9,11,12\nIn addition, a 4-mm punch biopsy specimen of a papule on the left dorsal hand showed a necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis with erythro- cyte extravasation and leukocytoclastic debris, findings that were consistent with leukocyto- clastic vasculitis (Fig. 4). Medium-sized cutane- ous vessels were spared. Leukocytoclastic vascu- litis is typically manifested by palpable purpura involving the lower legs and is characterized histologically by neutrophilic infiltration with the triad of leukocytoclasia, fibrinoid necrosis of vessel walls, and erythrocyte extravasation.13 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis can be idiopathic or associated with a broad range of causes, includ- ing infection, drugs, cancer, or other systemic diseases.13 The 2012 Revised International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference guidelines classify leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels as small- vessel vasculitis, a category that encompasses ANCA-associated vasculitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, among others, and as single-organ vasculitis when the findings are limited to skin.14 \nIn summary, on histologic examination, the\nskin-biopsy specimen of the left elbow in this patient revealed the presence of palisaded neu- trophilic and granulomatous dermatitis, and the skin-biopsy specimen of the left dorsal hand showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. We surmise that these seemingly disparate abnormalities may be related, given that palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis has previously been reported to arise as leukocytoclastic vasculitis, with evolution to the granulomatous state and, subsequently, to fibrosis at the stage of resolu- tion.9 Taken together, the constellation of find- ings from the two skin biopsies is consistent with stages of systemic disease\u2013associated palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.\nDr. John L. Niles: The diagnostic test in this\ncase was a blood test for ANCAs. Two kinds of ANCAs have been shown to be of diagnostic value: PR3-ANCA and ANCA directed against myeloperoxidase. These correlate with patterns of immunof luorescence of cytoplasmic ANCA and perinuclear ANCA, respectively.\nThis patient had a PR3-ANCA titer of 31,744 units (reference value, <20). As compared with biopsy, which is considered a reference standard, the sensitivity of ANCA testing to diagnose ANCA-associated vasculitis is estimated to be 85%, with a specificity of 98%.15 The sensitivity of ANCA testing is higher among patients with more extensive or severe disease, and higher titers are associated with greater disease specificity.\nThere is a spectrum of syndromes within the category of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Included in that spectrum are granulomatosis with poly- angiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, renal limited variants, eosinophilic granulomatosis with poly- angiitis, primary pulmonary fibrosis, and sub- glottic tracheal stenosis. The clinical subtype is defined by the clinical features, and in this case, both granulomatosis with polyangiitis and micro- scopic polyangiitis could be considered. The granulomatous features of the patient\u2019s skin- biopsy specimen of the elbow are more consis- tent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis than with microscopic polyangiitis, and PR3-ANCA is more common among patients with granulo- matosis with polyangiitis. The diagnosis in this case is ANCA-associated vasculitis, subtype PR3- ANCA\u2013associated vasculitis, consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\nFigure 3.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a punch biopsy specimen of a papule on the left elbow shows a dermal palisading granuloma, with central collagen degenera\u2011\ntion adjacent to the epidermal surface that indicates an area of perforation (Panel A). At higher magnifica\u2011 tion (Panel B), multinucleated giant cells (arrow) can be seen, along with neutrophils with leukocytoclasia (arrowhead) and necrobiotic collagen (asterisk), find\u2011 ings that are compatible with palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.\n\nFigure 4.
