    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Mubeen A. Shakir (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pain in the left upper quadrant and hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 1 year before this admis- sion, when fatigue and weight loss developed and she had abnormal results on liver-function tests after undergoing cholecystectomy for presumed acalculous cholecystitis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, which was performed as part of the evaluation to determine the cause of the abnormal liver-function test results, revealed hepatosplenomegaly (Fig. 1A).\nSeven months before this admission, a submandibular mass and swelling de- veloped; 1 month later, examination of a biopsy specimen of the mass revealed granulomatous sialadenitis. A liver biopsy was performed to investigate the pa- tient\u2019s abdominal distention, poor appetite, and persistently abnormal liver-func- tion test results, which were suggestive of cholestasis. The liver-biopsy specimen showed evidence of granulomatous hepatitis; portal and periportal nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation that was associated with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and some plasma cells; and stage 1 to 2 (portal and periportal) fibro- sis. Special stains for organisms (acid-fast and Grocott methenamine\u2013silver stains) were negative.\nCT of the chest revealed minimal bibasilar atelectasis and a trace left pleural effusion. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Tests for histoplasma species, blastomyces species, cryptococcus species, coccidioides species, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses were all negative, as was testing for antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and anti\u2013smooth muscle antibodies. A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the basis of the biopsy results of the submandibular gland and liver and the presence of hypercalcemia and an elevated angiotensin-converting\u2013enzyme level.\nFour months before this admission, prednisone therapy was initiated at a dose of 40 mg per day; subsequently, there was a marked reduction in the patient\u2019s abdominal distention and marked improvement in her appetite. Liver-function test results also improved. Methotrexate therapy was started at a dose of 15 mg per week, with plans to taper the dose of prednisone.\nThree months before this admission, the pa- tient stopped prednisone therapy because of irri- tability and insomnia. One month later, routine monitoring of the patient\u2019s liver function re- vealed worsening liver-function test results in a cholestatic pattern. This finding was attributed to undertreatment of sarcoidosis, but the patient declined to restart prednisone; the dose of metho- trexate was increased to 25 mg per week.\nDuring the next month, the patient noted fa- tigue, slowly progressive dyspnea on exertion, and cough, without fever or chills. She was evaluated by her primary care physician 1 month before this admission, and a chest radiograph showed bilateral, perihilar, diffuse, symmetric ground-glass opacities with scattered patchy opacities at the lung bases (Fig. 1B and 1C). Levo- floxacin was administered.\nThree weeks before this admission, CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed worsening hepato- splenomegaly. Prednisone therapy was started at a dose of 20 mg per day.\nOn the morning of admission, the patient was awakened from sleep by severe, sharp pain in the left upper quadrant. The pain was not worse with eating, and she reported no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Because of persistent pain throughout the day, she presented to the emer- gency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported progressive dyspnea on exertion and be- ing unable to climb stairs in her home. There was no chest pain, edema in the legs, weight gain, or orthopnea. She had a cough that was productive of clear sputum but had no fevers or chills.\nThe patient had a history of preeclampsia, Helicobacter pylori infection, cholecystectomy, and papillary thyroid cancer for which she had un- dergone hemithyroidectomy 9 years before this admission. In addition to methotrexate and pred- nisone, her medications included omeprazole and trazodone. Her father had hypertension and hy- perlipidemia, and one son had ulcerative colitis. Both maternal grandparents had had tuberculo- sis, but the patient had not had contact with them; her mother had latent tuberculosis. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as an administrative assistant and lived with her husband and children in a suburb of Boston. She had never smoked tobacco, did not use illicit drugs, and previously drank one glass of wine per week before her diagnosis of sarcoidosis. She had not traveled outside the United States in the past 5 years.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 112/56 mm Hg, the pulse 128 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.\nThe patient was awake and alert but appeared fatigued. The first and second heart sounds (S1 and S2) were normal, without murmurs; the jugular venous pressure, which was measured from the approximate midpoint of the right atrium, was 6 cm of water. Crackles were present in the middle and lower lung fields bilaterally. Normal bowel sounds were present, and the abdomen was soft and nondistended, with tender- ness in the left upper quadrant. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm below the right costal mar- gin; the spleen tip was also palpable. There was no edema in the legs. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate were normal, as were the results of kidney- function tests. The level of alanine aminotrans- ferase was 38 IU per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and total bilirubin were normal. The blood level of alkaline phosphatase was 268 IU per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Streptococcus pneu- moniae and Legionella pneumophila antigens were not detected in the urine. The blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value, <60); other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Victorine V. Muse: CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 2A and 2B), performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hepatosplenomegaly with a hypodense wedge-shaped region in the midpole of the spleen. A portable anteroposterior chest radio- graph (Fig. 2C) showed progressive coalescing consolidations in the middle and lower lobes with diffuse ground-glass opacities. CT of the chest (Fig. 2D), performed after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, revealed new mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy and confirmed the presence of multifocal confluent areas of airspace consolidation, with a back- ground of diffuse ground-glass opacities. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism or pleural effusions.\nDr. Shakir: The patient was admitted to the hospital. Treatment with prednisone, methotrex- ate, and omeprazole was stopped, and trazodone was continued. On hospital day 2, the tempera- ture rose to 39.1\u00b0C, the respiratory rate increased to 32 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion decreased to 89% while she was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. Supplemental oxy- gen was increased to a rate of 5 liters per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation increased to 93%. Cultures of the blood were obtained.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Margaret M. Chapman: This 50-year-old woman who has been receiving immunosuppressive med- ication for the treatment of sarcoidosis presents with subacute, accelerating pulmonary symptoms and is found to have tachypnea, hypoxemia, and fever with progressive bilateral consolidations on chest imaging. Evaluation of the clinical time- line, current severity of illness, and imaging find- ings allows me to create a problem representa- tion that informs my diagnostic thought process. I will use these elements as a filter through which I will develop a differential diagnosis. To do so,there are three discrete questions to address: Does the patient really have sarcoidosis? Could her current presentation be a manifestation or complication of pulmonary sarcoidosis? Could her illness be due to a complication from the treatment of sarcoidosis?\n\nSarcoidosis\nWe often assume that a patient\u2019s medical history is correct, but in this patient who presents with a progressive illness of unknown cause, it is worth reevaluating the recent diagnosis of sar- coidosis. Sarcoidosis is a challenging diagnosis to make and can have myriad clinical manifesta- tions. It is theoretically possible that this pa- tient\u2019s symptoms that began 7 months before this admission were due to something other than sarcoidosis and that her current presenta- tion is a manifestation of that other underlying illness. Other than sarcoidosis, what could explain the combination of hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal results on liver-function tests, and a biopsy showing hepatic granulomas?\nOn the basis of previous negative testing, tuberculosis; fungal diseases such as cryptococco- sis, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis; and in- fection with HIV, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B  virus, hepatitis C virus, and coccidioidomycosis\nare all unlikely diagnoses. An autoimmune process such as primary biliary cirrhosis is unlikely on the basis of negative serologic testing. The patient has not been receiving medications that can lead to hepatic granulomas, such as allo- purinol, quinidine, sulfa-containing agents, or checkpoint inhibitors, and she has not received the bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin vaccine. Evidence of cancer would probably have been apparent on her imaging studies and biopsy. I suspect that sarcoidosis is indeed the most likely explanation for her initial presentation 7 months before this admission.\nManifestations and Complications of Pulmonary Sarcoidosis\nThe patient\u2019s treatment with glucocorticoids has been intermittent, which raises the possibility that she has sarcoidosis that has been inade- quately treated, along with new pulmonary man- ifestations. Although sarcoidosis commonly af- fects the lungs, pulmonary sarcoidosis would not match the patient\u2019s presentation in terms of the three clinical filters through which I am viewing this case: time course, clinical severity, and imaging findings. Pulmonary sarcoidosis often manifests indolently, and patients may be asymptomatic for a long period of time, which is unlike this patient\u2019s accelerating course. The common symptoms of cough and dyspnea do not match this patient\u2019s clinical presentation of hypoxemia and high fever. Finally, pulmonary sarcoidosis can be manifested by a variety of radiographic patterns, but none are consistent with this patient\u2019s bilateral patchy and consoli- dative infiltrates that are present predominantly in the lower lobes.\nOther possible causes of this patient\u2019s current presentation are potential complications of sar- coidosis, including infection, venous thrombo- embolism, and pulmonary hypertension. Second- ary bacterial infections, such as those caused by streptococcus, staphylococcus, or atypical bacteria, are possible, but the lack of improvement in her condition after a course of broad-spectrum antibiotic agents makes a bacterial cause un- likely. A fungal infection, such as aspergillosis, could be considered, but the radiographic find- ings in this case are not consistent with such an infection. Venous thromboembolism can be a complication of pulmonary sarcoidosis, but I would not expect a high fever or radiographic findings such as those observed in this patient to be associated with venous thromboembolism. In addition, although pulmonary hypertension can develop in patients with sarcoidosis, the sub- acute, accelerating time course seen in this pa- tient would be unusual. Given that none of these possibilities are consistent with the time course of her illness, her clinical symptoms, or her radio- graphic findings, both progression of sarcoid- osis and complication of sarcoidosis can be ruled out.\n\nComplications from the Treatment of Sarcoidosis\nWhen I consider the possibility of complications from the patient\u2019s recent medication use related to the treatment of her sarcoidosis, I separate the complications into two categories: medica- tion effect and infections due to immunosup- pression. Although prednisone has multiple ef- fects on the body, it does not typically affect the lungs, so I will remove it from consideration. Methotrexate can have two types of effects on the lungs: lymphoproliferative and inflammatory. A lymphoproliferative effect on the lungs would produce nodules and masses. However, such a manifestation would not be consistent with the radiographic pattern seen in this patient, nor would it fit with the accelerating time course of her illness; therefore, I think that a lymphopro- liferative effect from methotrexate is unlikely to explain her presentation.\nHowever, a direct inflammatory effect from methotrexate is worth consideration. This effect would manifest as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a disorder that often occurs weeks to months after initiation of methotrexate. Patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis from methotrexate may present with cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and fever, as this patient does, and chest radiog- raphy often reveals an interstitial infiltrate pre- dominantly in the lower lung fields.1 In summary, a direct inflammatory effect of methotrexate is consistent with this patient\u2019s time course, clini- cal severity, and radiographic findings and re- mains a possible diagnosis in this case.\nCould an infection occurring in the context of immunosuppressive medication use explain this patient\u2019s presentation? Assessment of the net state of immunosuppression in a person receiv- ing immunosuppressive medications is often dif- ficult. However, I consider this patient to be moderately immunosuppressed on the basis of her receipt of moderate doses of prednisone and methotrexate. She has a cumulative prednisone exposure of almost 2 grams. She is therefore at risk for both opportunistic infections as well as more common infections.2 With a focus on infec- tions that could cause pneumonia and make a person as clinically ill as this patient, I consid- ered the possibility of infection with Staphylococ- cus aureus, S. pneumoniae, community-acquired atyp- ical bacteria (e.g., mycoplasma, legionella, or chlamydophila), nocardia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or cryptococcus species. Of these, only infection with nocardia, P. jirovecii, and cryptococcus spe- cies could follow the time course of a subacute, accelerating illness; infection with the other pathogens would have a much faster clinical time course. Only P. jirovecii pneumonia is con- sistent with the radiographic pattern seen on this patient\u2019s imaging studies, which makes it the most likely infectious cause of this patient\u2019s illness.\nI  am  left  with a  differential diagnosis of methotrexate-induced hypersensitivity pneumo- nitis and P. jirovecii pneumonia. P. jirovecii pneu- monia appears to be the most likely diagnosis, since this condition is more common than methotrexate-induced hypersensitivity pneumo- nitis. Unfortunately, the totality of the data provided in this case does not perfectly support that diagnosis. This patient\u2019s serum assay for 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, a test with at least 90% sensitiv- ity to diagnose P. jirovecii pneumonia, is nega- tive.3 However, the pretest probability of P. jirove- cii pneumonia in this patient is very high, and all the remaining data for this patient are consis- tent with this diagnosis. Thus, a negative serum 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan test is not compelling enough as evidence to convince me that P. jirovecii pneumo- nia is not the correct diagnosis. I suspect that the diagnostic test that was performed in this case was direct fluorescent antibody staining of an induced-sputum specimen to test for P. jirovecii.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Melis N. Anahtar: The diagnostic test that was performed was a direct fluorescent antibody test that was specific for P. jirovecii; microscopic ex- amination of the patient\u2019s bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid revealed rare aggregates of P. jirovecii cysts (Fig. 3). P. jirovecii is a fungus with a complex life cycle and cannot be grown under standard cul- ture conditions. It is identified either with the use of direct microscopic visualization, such as with the highly specific direct immunofluores- cence staining used in this case, or with a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test. As com- pared with direct visualization, a PCR test is more sensitive but less specific owing to its greater ability to detect asymptomatic carriage.4 In addition to the direct-detection methods described above, a blood test for 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan (a cell-wall polysaccharide found in most fungi, including P. jirovecii) is often used as a noninva- sive diagnostic test for P. jirovecii pneumonia. The test has an overall sensitivity of 91% and an overall specificity of 79%.5 However, this pa- tient\u2019s 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan blood test was negative, at less than 31 pg per milliliter (reference value,\n<60), despite diagnostic confirmation of P. jirove- cii pneumonia. This finding reflects the fact that the 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan blood test is less sensitive in persons without HIV infection than in those with HIV infection or acquired immunodefi- ciency syndrome (AIDS), probably owing to a lower fungal burden, and must be interpreted within the context of the pretest probability of P. jirovecii pneumonia.\n\nFigure 3.
