    "Primary Symptom": "A 24-Year-Old Man with Fever, Cough, and Dyspnea",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Xavier Guell (Medicine): A 24-year-old man was transferred to this hospital be- cause of fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnea.\nThe patient had been well until 5 days before this presentation, when fatigue, malaise, fever, chills, and cough that was productive of terra cotta\u2013colored sputum developed. Three days before this presentation, he had presented to an urgent care clinic with nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. A chest radiograph was reportedly normal, and the patient was told he had a viral illness. Intravenous fluids were administered, and he was advised to return to the clinic if symptoms persisted or worsened.\nThe next day, symptoms increased in severity, and the patient was unable to eat or drink owing to persistent nausea and vomiting. Back pain, neck pain, headache, and photophobia developed. The patient reported positional chest pain and dys- pnea, which progressed rapidly, such that he could not walk up a flight of stairs. The day before presentation to this hospital, he presented to another hospital.\nThe temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/66 mm Hg, the heart rate 73 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 35 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. On examination, he appeared unwell and in mild distress. Breath sounds were decreased throughout the upper and lower lung fields, and scattered expiratory wheezes were present. The white-cell count was 21,890 per microliter (reference range, 4800 to 10,800), with a neutro- phil count of 45% (9851 per microliter; reference range, 37 to 80% [1800 to 7700 per microliter]) and a band count of 23% (5035 per microliter; reference range, <5% [0 to 1100 per microliter]). The platelet count was 60,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), the creatinine level 1.37 mg per deciliter (121.1 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.66 to 1.25 mg per deciliter [58.3 to 110.5 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the lactate level 3.50 mmol per liter (32 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.70 to 2.10 mmol per liter [6.3 to 18.9 mg per deciliter]). Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative, as was a blood test for heterophile anti- bodies. Chest radiography revealed diffuse reticu- lonodular interstitial opacities in both lungs. Vancomycin, ceftriaxone, doxycycline, methyl- prednisolone, and intravenous f luids were ad- ministered.\nDuring the next 3 hours, the oxygen satura- tion decreased to 80% while the patient was re- ceiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. Bilevel positive airway pressure was initiated.\nDr. Shaunagh McDermott: Computed tomogra- phy (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1A through 1C) revealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs and interlobular septal thickening. Small bilateral pleural effusions were also present.\nDr. Guell: The patient\u2019s family requested that the patient be transferred to this hospital. The patient\u2019s trachea was intubated in a nonemer- gency setting; continuous infusions of norepi- nephrine, propofol, and hydromorphone were started. He was transported by medical helicop- ter to this hospital, arriving approximately 17 hours after his presentation to the first hospital. On the patient\u2019s arrival at this hospital, ad- ditional history was obtained from family mem- bers. The patient had been camping in a northern New England forest for 9 days before presentation to the other hospital. Four days before presentation to this hospital, he found an unat- tached tick on his head, but he had no known tick bites; however, he had many mosquito bites. The patient lived on the mid-Atlantic coast with two cats in a trailer in which mold was report- edly present. He enjoyed outdoor activities such as dirt biking, hiking, boating, rafting, and swimming in fresh water. He worked in carpen- try. During a house renovation project approxi- mately 2 weeks before this presentation, he was bitten by a mouse; he did not seek medical at- tention.\nThe patient had a history of chronic lower back\npain. He took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He had smoked cigarettes for 13 years and had quit 1 year earlier. During the past year, the patient used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and smoked commercial marijuana on a daily basis. His parents and older sibling were alive and well; his grandfather was living with a gastrointestinal cancer.\nThe temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the blood pres- sure 98/57 mm Hg, the heart rate 78 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP], 12 cm of water; tidal volume, 500 ml; fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2], 1.0; respira- tory rate, 15 breaths per minute). The pupils\nwere symmetric and reactive, the lungs were clear on auscultation, and there were no rashes. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Tests for Legionella pneumophila sero- group 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in the urine were negative, as were tests of a naso- pharyngeal swab for adenovirus, metapneumo- virus, and parainfluenza virus antigens. Screen- ing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 and HIV type 1 p24 antigen was negative. Urinalysis results were normal. Blood cultures were obtained. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. McDermott: A chest radiograph obtained on\narrival at this hospital showed diffuse bilateral opacities, with endotracheal and enteric tubes in an appropriate position (Fig. 1D).\nDr. Guell: Transthoracic echocardiography re- vealed diffuse hypokinesis of the left ventricle and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% (reference range, 50 to 75). A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid was color- less; the total protein level was 31 mg per deci- liter (reference range, 5 to 55), the glucose level 93 mg per deciliter (5.2 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]), and the nucleated-cell count 1 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining revealed few mononuclear cells and no neutrophils or organisms.\nDr. Alexandra K. Wong: Flexible bronchoscopy performed on the first hospital day (Fig. 2) re- vealed diffuse erythema and inflammation in the airways, scattered areas of submucosal pete- chiae and hemorrhage, and scant secretions that were most prominent in the left lung. The bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid was clear and yellow; specimens were obtained for culture. These findings are nonspecific and are often seen with infectious or inflammatory processes, typically accompanied by thrombocytopenia.\nDr. Guell: Treatment with vancomycin, ceftria- xone, and doxycycline was continued, and genta- micin and furosemide were initiated.\n\nFigure 1. Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nAxial CT images (Panels A and B) obtained before presentation to this hospital show diffuse ground\u2011glass opacities in both lungs, interlobular septal thickening (arrows), and bilateral pleural effusions (asterisks). A coronal CT image (Panel C) shows diffuse bilateral ground\u2011glass opacities. A radiograph (Panel D) obtained after presentation to this hospital shows diffuse bilateral opacities.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Nicolas Barros: This previously healthy 24-year- old man had fever, fatigue, cough, and dyspnea with rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure in the absence of preceding upper respi- ratory symptoms. Before the development of symp- toms, he had multiple epidemiologic exposures, including a rodent bite, freshwater activities, mosquito bites, an unattached tick, and e-ciga- rette use.\nThe patient\u2019s initial illness was nonspecific un- til a cardiopulmonary disorder developed abrupt- ly and led to intubation and initiation of vaso- pressor support. He had severe leukocytosis, prominent bandemia, and thrombocytopenia, but there was little to no involvement of the liver or kidneys. In addition, left ventricular dysfunc- tion developed, and a bronchoscopy revealed diffuse erythema and inflammation but no overt purulence or hemorrhage. On the basis of his signs, symptoms, and exposures, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes e-cigarette\u2013asso- ciated lung injury, community-acquired pneumo- nia, leptospirosis, tularemia, pneumonic plague, and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.\nE-Cigarette\u2013Associated Lung Injury\nSince August 2019, a rapid increase in e-cigarette\u2013 associated lung injury has been reported in young and otherwise healthy persons.1,2 In a case series involving 53 patients with e-cigarette\u2013 associated lung injury, Layden et al.3 showed that affected patients have progressive shortness of breath, with a myriad of constitutional symp- toms. Diffuse bilateral lung infiltrates occur in all patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, although a profound decrease in arterial oxygen saturation is usually progressive rather than abrupt, and patients typically do not have left ventricular dysfunction or hypoperfusion as this patient did. The time course of this patient\u2019s ill- ness appears to be too rapid to be e-cigarette\u2013 associated lung injury, and the development of ventricular dysfunction and hypoperfusion is not consistent with descriptions of this lung disease.\n\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia is the most common cause of fever and hypoxemic respira- tory failure among otherwise healthy persons. Community-acquired pneumonia is generally defined by a newly recognized pulmonary infil- trate associated with two or more of the follow- ing symptoms: new or increased cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, confusion, fever, rales, and leukocytosis.4 It can be caused by common bacterial respira- tory pathogens in circulation in the community, atypical bacteria such as legionella or myco- plasma, viruses, or fungi.4\nThere is not one constellation of clinical find-\nings for each cause of community-acquired pneu- monia that can be used to definitively dis- criminate it from other causes. However, viral pneumonia is characterized by the presence of upper respiratory symptoms, a sick contact, and patchy pulmonary infiltrates, with a normal or minimally elevated white-cell count.5 None of these features were present in this patient.\nPneumonia caused by community-acquired bacterial pathogens is typically characterized by the presence of fever, cough, and progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure with lobar consoli- dations and purulent secretions.5 S. pneumoniae is responsible for approximately 50% of all bacte- rial pneumonias.6 This patient\u2019s chest imaging did not show any alveolar consolidation. Fur- thermore, the test for streptococcal antigen in the urine, which has a negative predictive value of greater than 90%, was negative.7 Therefore, a diagnosis of pneumonia due to a typical bacte- rial pathogen would be unlikely in this case.\nStaphylococcus aureus is reported to be isolated\nin 1 to 2% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.6 It usually occurs in patients recov- ering from influenza and is associated with severe necrotizing pneumonia.5 This patient did not have any upper respiratory symptoms suggestive of preceding influenza infection; in addition, nucleic acid testing for influenza virus was negative, and the CT scan of the chest did not show features of necrotizing pneumonia.\nGram-negative bacteria such as Klebsiella pneu- moniae are uncommon causes of community- acquired pneumonia, except in patients with underlying conditions. Patients with pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pul- monary disease, or diabetes, as well as patients who are immunocompromised, are at increased risk for community-acquired pneumonia caused by gram-negative organisms.5 However, this pa- tient was healthy and had none of these condi- tions, making community-acquired pneumonia caused by gram-negative bacteria an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\nPatients who have community-acquired pneu-\nmonia caused by atypical bacteria such as myco- plasma and chlamydophila typically present with nonspecific bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are usually associated with cough lasting more than 5 days and a normal or minimally elevated white-cell count.5 Although severe hypoxemic respiratory failure develops in some patients, the tempo of progression is rarely as abrupt as it was in this patient.\nLegionellosis accounts for 2 to 9% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia and is charac- terized by the presence of fever with a tempera- ture of more than 39\u00b0C with associated relative bradycardia, an elevated C-reactive protein level, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and micro- scopic hematuria.8,9 This patient had an elevated C-reactive protein level and hypophosphatemia, but he also had severe myalgias, relative lympho- penia, thrombocytopenia, and fever without associated bradycardia. Furthermore, he had a negative urine test for L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigen; this bacterium is the underlying cause of 84% of cases of legionellosis.10\nWith the exception of endemic mycoses, fun-\ngal pneumonia is exceedingly rare in immuno- competent hosts, and the fungi typically have a nodular appearance on radiographic imaging.11,12 The incidence of endemic fungal infection in the mid-Atlantic and New England regions in which this patient resided and traveled is low. Infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis is characterized by large consolidations and skin lesions, and infec- tion with Histoplasma capsulatum can be mani- fested by nonspecific pulmonary infiltrates.13,14 However, manifestations in an immunocompe- tent host tend to be subacute and are not char- acterized by a hyperacute deterioration, as was seen in this patient.\n \nLeptospirosis\nLeptospirosis has been reported in multiple states in the United States and is associated with exposure to fresh water. After an incubation period of 2 to 26 days, a biphasic disease develops. The initial phase lasts approximately 1 week and is characterized by fever, chills, headache, severe myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and conjunctival suf- fusion. After the acute illness, patients are rela- tively asymptomatic for 3 or 4 days before the immune phase begins; this second phase is characterized by proteinuria, severe headache, and pulmonary infiltrates.15 Although the pul- monary infiltrates are usually nonspecific, pa- tients in whom pulmonary failure develops will invariably have hemorrhagic infiltrates.16 This patient\u2019s illness was not biphasic, and he did not have conjunctival suffusion, urinary abnormali- ties, or hemorrhagic infiltrates.\nTularemia\nTularemia is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. Humans become infected after contact with an infected animal or an arthropod vector. Although F. tularensis can infect a wide variety of vertebrates, including rodents, the disease is most commonly associ- ated with rabbits and hares.17 There are three different clinical presentations of tularemia: ulceroglandular, typhoidal, and pneumonic. Pri- mary pneumonic tularemia occurs through di- rect inhalation of aerosolized particles contain- ing F. tularensis. The incubation period is short, ranging from 3 to 5 days.18 Although patients usually have sudden onset of influenza-like symptoms, dyspnea, severe headache, nausea, vomiting, dry cough, and nonspecific pulmo- nary infiltrates, they seldom have hyperacute cardiopulmonary deterioration, as this patient did. The prolonged incubation period, the occur- rence of hyperacute cardiopulmonary deteriora- tion, and the absence of contact with rabbits or hares makes the diagnosis of tularemia unlikely in this case.\nPneumonic Plague\nYersinia pestis is a gram-negative coccobacillus that is associated with the three forms of the murine zoonotic plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.19 Patients with pneumonic plague typically have sudden onset of dyspnea, high fever, pleuritic chest pain, and cough that is usually purulent or bloody. They usually present with marked leukocytosis, bandemia, and thrombo- cytopenia.19,20 However, the incubation period of pneumonic plague is exceedingly short, ranging from a few hours to a few days.21 In this patient, exposure to rodents occurred approximately 2 weeks before the onset of symptoms. Further- more, he did not have purulent or bloody sputum.\n\nHantavirus Infection\nHantaviruses are murine viruses associated with two severe clinical presentations: the hemor- rhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. \u201cOld World\u201d hanta- viruses are associated with the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and \u201cNew World\u201d hanta- viruses are associated with hantavirus cardio- pulmonary syndrome.22,23 Hantavirus cardiopul- monary syndrome was first described in 1993 during an outbreak of unexplained fever and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) among members of the Navajo tribe at the northern border between New Mexico and Arizona. Since 1993, a total of 728 cases have been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).25 Sin Nombre virus is the most common cause of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the United States, and the natural host is the deer mouse (Fig. 3).23 Exposure to Sin Nombre virus can occur through inhalation of aerosolized particles from contaminated feces, urine, or saliva or through direct inoculation from an animal bite. The incubation period is 2 to 4 weeks and is followed by a prodromal phase that lasts 3 to 5 days. This phase is char- acterized by high-grade fever, myalgias, malaise, severe headache with neck pain, abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, and occa- sionally diarrhea. Severe leukocytosis with ban- demia and thrombocytopenia also develops. There is typically minimal or no involvement of the liver or kidneys. The prodromal phase is fol- lowed by an abrupt progression to the cardiopul- monary phase, which is characterized by pro- ductive cough with nonpurulent secretions and dyspnea with severe respiratory distress. Myo- cardial depression with increased peripheral vascular resistance is also common.26\nThis patient was bitten by a mouse approximately 2 weeks before his presentation to the first hospital. He had nonspecific symptoms, including fever, chills, myalgias, and abdominal pain, with a combination of leukocytosis, ban- demia, thrombocytopenia, and pulmonary in- volvement for 3 days. Subsequently, within hours after his presentation to the first hospital, a cardiopulmonary disorder and hypoperfusion developed abruptly and led to intubation and initiation of vasopressor therapy. The constella- tion of his symptoms is highly suggestive of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.\nTo establish the presence of Sin Nombre virus infection, I would perform serologic tests for hantavirus. Antibodies (IgM and IgG) against Sin Nombre virus develop rapidly during the pro- dromal phase and are almost universally present during the cardiopulmonary phase. The presence of these antibodies would confirm the diagnosis of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.\n\n\n\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome due to Sin Nombre virus infection.",
    "Diagnosis": "Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome",
    "Key testing": "",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sarah E. Turbett: The diagnostic test was an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Sin Nombre virus, which was positive for both IgM and IgG at titers of 1:6400 or above (reference titer, <1:400). A qualitative assay to detect all hantaviral nucleic acids in the blood was also positive.\nSerologic testing, nucleic acid testing, and immunohistochemical staining are all accept- able methods for diagnostic confirmation of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Sero- logic testing for hantavirus-specific IgM is the most commonly performed diagnostic test, be- cause almost all infected persons will have hantavirus-specific IgM at the onset of clinical symptoms.28 Hantavirus-specific IgG is often also present in the blood shortly after the onset of illness and can persist for months to years after the acute illness has occurred; the detec- tion of rising titers of hantavirus-specific IgG in serial samples can also be used for diagnostic confirmation.28,29 Nucleic acid testing for the detection of hantavirus viremia can be a useful diagnostic tool only if it is performed early in the course of the acute illness, since blood levels of the virus decrease quickly after the onset of symptoms.30 Immunohistochemical staining for hantaviral antigens directly on tissue can also be performed.\nIn this case, the patient met the laboratory criteria of the case definition for hantavirus car- diopulmonary syndrome, as specified by the CDC.29 Given the patient\u2019s clinical syndrome, the diagnosis of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syn- drome was confirmed.\nTreatment of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syn- drome is largely supportive care, and mortality approaches 40%.25 Although the antiviral ribavirin has in vitro efficacy against hantavirus species, clinical data regarding its efficacy are mixed, and toxic effects from this medication are com- mon.30 As such, use of this agent for the treat- ment of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is not recommended.\n\n\n",
