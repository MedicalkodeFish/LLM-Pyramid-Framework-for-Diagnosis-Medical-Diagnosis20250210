    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: A 65-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of bilateral eye pain and decreased vision.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before this admis- sion, when constant aching pain developed in the left eye and the left side of the head. During the next few days, the vision in the left eye gradually became blurry. Three days before this admission, redness developed in the right eye. The patient used tetrahydrozoline eye drops, but symptoms did not abate. One day before this admission, pain developed in the right eye that was similar to the pain in the left eye. The patient sought evaluation by his primary care physician, who recom- mended that he present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival, the patient rated the eye pain and headache at 2 on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10 indicating the most severe pain). The pain was not worse with eye movement or accompanied by flashing lights, floaters, or discharge. The patient reported no trauma but noted weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past 2 weeks, as well as pain with chewing food. He did not have scalp tenderness, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, numbness, weakness, or slurred speech.\nThe patient had a history of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, which had been diagnosed 2 years before this admission and treated with plasmapheresis, dexamethasone, and four cycles of bortezomib (with discontinuation of bortezo- mib after 4 months because of peripheral neuropathy), as well as six cycles of bendamustine. During the 9 months that followed the completion of treatment with bendamustine, there was active surveillance of the blood IgM level. One month before this admission, the IgM level was 1001 mg per deciliter (reference range, 53 to 334), and biopsy of the bone marrow revealed persistent disease. One week before this admission, the patient took his first dose of ibrutinib, which had been prescribed 3 months earlier.\nOther medical history included latent tuber- culosis, depression, anxiety, prediabetes, folate deficiency, and seasonal allergies. Medications included ibrutinib, isoniazid, pyridoxine, sertra- line, citalopram, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, flutica- sone nasal spray, and a multivitamin. Rituximab had caused anaphylaxis. The patient did not smoke tobacco, use illicit drugs, or drink alco- hol. He was originally from Central America and had immigrated to the United States 50 years earlier; 1 month earlier, he had moved from the West Coast to an urban area of New England. He lived in an apartment with his niece and cousins and worked in construction. His family history was unknown.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 104/69 mm Hg, the pulse 60 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acu- ity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye with correction. On confrontation testing, visual fields in the left eye were deficient in the inferior temporal and nasal aspects. On the Ishi- hara color test, all plates were identified with the right eye but only the control plate was identi- fied with the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light; an afferent pupillary defect was present in the left eye. There was no propto- sis. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was present in the right eye; pterygia were present in both eyes. On funduscopic examination, the optic disk in the left eye was edematous. Results of tests of cranial nerve function, power, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal.\nThe blood hemoglobin level was 12.5 g per\ndeciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), the hema- tocrit 39.8% (reference range, 41.0 to 53.0), the white-cell count 8090 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), and the platelet count 131,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The IgM level was 540 mg per deci- liter; the level of IgM kappa M component in the gamma region was 0.36 g per deciliter. Blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function. Tests for Lyme disease, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, and bartonellosis were negative. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 anti- gen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2 were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: Computed tomography\n(CT) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, revealed mild thickening and perineural enhancement along the entire length of the left optic nerve (Fig. 1A and 1B). There was a defor- mity of the left lamina papyracea with medial deviation of the medial and superior rectus muscle, as well as postoperative changes in the sinuses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits, performed with and without the administration of contrast material, was limited by artifact but revealed increased signal intensity and possible focal enhancement within the retrobulbar segment of the left optic nerve (Fig. 1C and 1D).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Marc A. Bouffard: This patient is a 65-year-old man presenting with subacute, progressive, painful vision loss in the left eye and pain in the right eye. Other key features of his history in- clude treatment-refractory Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macro- globulinemia, recent use of immunosuppressive chemotherapy, and latent tuberculosis treated with isoniazid. The first step in developing a differential diagnosis is to localize the anatomi- cal source of the patient\u2019s vision loss.\n\nNeuro-ophthalmologic Localization of Vision Loss\nCauses of monocular vision loss include abnor- malities in the cornea, lens, vitreous body, retina, and optic nerve. A visually significant abnormal- ity in the cornea or lens would be obvious to the examiner, because the vision would improve sub- stantially with pinhole correction or the abnor- mality would obscure the examiner\u2019s view of the fundus. Thus, these sources of vision loss can be ruled out in this patient, who had an adequate examination.\nRetinal disease could be a consideration, since the patient had subnormal visual acuity despite correction and despite the fact that there was a clear view of the fundus on examination. However, his vision loss had all five cardinal features of optic neuropathy: subnormal visual acuity with correction, dyschromatopsia, visual field loss in a pattern consistent with optic nerve disease, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and an abnormal appearance of the optic disk. The presence of optic disk edema helps to narrow the differential diagnosis associated with optic neuropathy. Several broad categories of disease encompass most of the entities that cause optic neuropathy with optic disk edema.\nOptic Neuropathy with Optic Disk Edema\nIntracranial Hypertension\nThe term papilledema is defined as optic disk edema due to intracranial hypertension. In pa- tients with papilledema, subnormal visual acuity and dyschromatopsia (features noted in this pa- tient) would not typically occur until the papille- dema is very advanced, by which point, monocu- lar optic disk edema (also noted in this patient) would be extremely uncommon.1 Monocular optic disk edema can occur in patients with early papilledema, but the associated visual field deficit is typically blind-spot enlargement due to disk edema itself or peripheral, often nasal, vi- sual field loss.2,3 In patients with papilledema, headache due to intracranial hypertension is of- ten present, but eye pain is less common. MRI of the orbits would not be expected to reveal enhancement of the optic nerves.\n \n\nOptic Neuritis\nOptic neuritis typically causes subacute, pro- gressive, painful vision loss with enhancement of the optic nerve on MRI of the orbits. It may be idiopathic or associated with a neuroinflam- matory disorder such as multiple sclerosis, neu- romyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorder (MOGAD).4-10\nThis patient\u2019s age, sex, and ethnic back- ground are atypical for idiopathic optic neuritis and multiple sclerosis\u2013associated optic neuritis; optic disk edema is present in only approximately one third of patients with optic neuritis attribut- able to these conditions.5 In addition, this pa- tient\u2019s age and sex are atypical for a new diag- nosis of NMOSD, but paraneoplastic NMOSD can occur in the context of either solid or hema- tologic cancer; thus, NMOSD-associated optic neuritis needs to be ruled out in this case.11-14 This patient\u2019s vision loss would be unusually mild for an episode of NMOSD-associated optic neuritis, since 80% of these episodes result in a decrease  in  visual  acuity  to  20/200  or  worse; furthermore, he does not appear to have longi- tudinally extensive enhancement of the optic nerve on MRI of the orbits, which would be sug- gestive of this condition.6,7,11,15 Optic disk edema is a frequent characteristic of MOGAD-associated optic neuritis, but other features suggestive of this condition \u2014 including bilateral optic neuri- tis, severe vision loss, and longitudinally exten- sive optic neuritis with thickening of the optic nerve \u2014 are absent in this patient, and his age and sex are atypical.8,9\nOther immune-related inflammatory conditions of the optic nerve, specifically those caused by anti\u2013glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) anti- body and by anti\u2013collapsin response mediator protein 5 (CRMP-5) antibody, are unlikely in this patient. The GFAP antibody is usually associated with symmetric optic disk edema with preserved afferent visual function and periventricular ra- dial enhancement on MRI of the head.16-18 The CRMP-5 antibody is usually associated with intra- ocular inflammation without optic nerve en- hancement on MRI of the orbits.19,20\n\nInfectious Optic Neuropathy\nInfectious optic neuropathy causes subacute, progressive, often painless vision loss. With the exception of treponemal optic neuropathy (which has been ruled out in this case), infectious optic neuropathy is usually accompanied by at least one intraocular finding, such as uveitis, retinitis, a macular star consistent with neuroretinitis, or retinal vasculitis. None of these findings are present in this patient, but it is plausible that immunosuppression could modify the expected presentation of infectious optic neuropathy.\nTuberculous optic neuropathy is an important consideration in this patient, who has latent tuber- culosis. Optic disk edema is present in approxi- mately half of patients with tuberculous optic neuropathy; concomitant uveitis is present in approximately 90% of patients.21 The absence of uveitis in this patient and the fact that he is be- ing treated with isoniazid decrease the likelihood of this diagnosis.\nThe presence of a deformity of the lamina papyracea, which is the bone that separates the orbit from the ethmoid sinus, suggests the pos- sibility of rhino-orbital fungal infection. The ethmoid sinus is a common site of aspergillus and mucorales colonization. In patients with rhino-orbital fungal infection, the sinuses typi- cally appear abnormal, if not completely opaci- fied, on CT. Optic nerve invasion from a retro- bulbar route may result in optic neuropathy without intraocular inflammation. In the eval- uation of patients with possible rhino-orbital fungal infection, it is important to seek specific comment from the interpreting radiologist to determine whether the imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis.22-24 Direct inspec- tion of the sinuses by an otolaryngologist is re- quired if there is a high index of suspicion.\nIschemic Optic Neuropathy\nAnterior ischemic optic neuropathy is character- ized by the presence of optic disk edema. Ische- mic optic neuropathy typically results in painless vision loss that develops in a stepwise fashion (with changes occurring infrequently and sud- denly), often with inferior altitudinal or general- ized visual field loss.25,26 In patients with ische- mic optic neuropathy, results of contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits are normal.10 Although the time course of this patient\u2019s illness and the im- aging findings argue against a diagnosis of typical ischemic optic neuropathy, there are two important caveats to consider. First, Walden- str\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia is sometimes associ- ated with light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, which,\n \nunlike transthyretin amyloidosis, can result in a presentation similar to that of giant-cell arteri- tis, with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, jaw claudication, temporal allodynia, and constitu- tional symptoms.27-30 Second, transformation of Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia to a more aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder can re- sult in intravascular lymphoma, which can cause optic nerve ischemia and enhancement.31 It is worth noting that, in patients who have hyper- viscosity syndrome associated with Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, vision loss is usually attrib- utable to central retinal vein occlusion or venous stasis retinopathy, rather than to optic neu- ropathy.32-34 If further diagnostic testing were unrevealing in this case, a temporal artery or fat-pad biopsy to rule out amyloidosis could be considered.\n\nInfiltrative Optic Neuropathy\nProgressive loss of visual acuity and visual fields is expected with infiltration of the optic nerve by cancer or sarcoidosis, although the tempo of vi- sion loss, presence of pain, and appearance of the optic nerve (edematous or atrophic) may vary substantially among patients. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits often reveals enhancement of the optic nerve, although neuroimaging may be unrevealing in patients with nascent or indolent disease.\nThe clinical course, examination results, and imaging findings in the context of Walden- str\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia make an infiltrative optic neuropathy the most likely process affect- ing this patient. Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulin- emia is a lymphoplasmacytic disorder that can directly invade the central nervous system (CNS) and orbits (Bing\u2013Neel syndrome) or convert to a higher-grade lymphoproliferative disorder such as diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, which can in turn invade the optic nerve without obvious in- volvement of other CNS sites.35-42 Bing\u2013Neel syndrome is uncommon but fits well with the patient\u2019s history of treatment-refractory Walden- str\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, subacute progres- sive vision loss, optic neuropathy with optic disk edema, and enhancement of the optic nerve.36,43-45 I think the most parsimonious explanation of this patient\u2019s optic neuropathy is Bing\u2013Neel syn- drome. To establish this diagnosis, I would per- form a lumbar puncture and subsequent cere- brospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to look for a clonal lymphoplasmacytic population, an elevated pro- tein level, IgM kappa or lambda band restriction, or an IgH rearrangement in the CSF matching one that was seen in the serum.35,36 Identifica- tion of high-grade lymphoma is an unlikely but plausible result.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Lucas R. Massoth: The diagnostic procedure was a lumbar puncture. The CSF was clear and colorless, with no xanthochromia. Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of the CSF (Fig. 2A) revealed an in- creased number of nucleated cells (22 per micro- liter; normal range, 0 to 5), of which 98% were lymphocytes. The morphologic appearance of the cells ranged from small lymphocytic cells with mature-appearing nuclei and scant cytoplasm to medium-sized lymphoplasmacytoid forms with relatively abundant cytoplasm, eccentrical- ly located nuclei, and occasionally distinct peri- nuclear hofs.\nThe CSF total protein level was elevated (195 mg per deciliter; normal range, 5 to 55), and the glucose level was normal (65 mg per deciliter [3.6 mmol per liter]; normal range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). Electro- phoresis (Fig. 2B) and immunofixation of the CSF revealed an IgM kappa paraprotein identical to the paraprotein identified in serum. Flow cy- tometry of the CSF (Fig. 2C and 2D) revealed a kappa-restricted B-cell population that lacked expression of CD5 and CD10; B-cell clonality studies showed a clonal IgH rearrangement. Taken together, these findings are consistent with CNS involvement by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.\nPrimary lymphoma of the CNS is rare, ac-\ncounting for approximately 3% of primary brain tumors. Most cases of primary CNS lymphoma are diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.46 Low-grade B-cell lymphoma may involve the CNS, but such involvement is usually due to systemic disease.\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is a neoplasm of small B lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lympho- cytes, and plasma cells.47 It is associated with paraprotein, most often the IgM type. The con- current presence of paraprotein and bone marrow involvement by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma\nconstitutes Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia.48 Although bone marrow infiltration is typical of this condition, extramedullary disease develops during the disease course in 20% of patients. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma has a nonspecific immunophenotype and must be distinguished from other small-B-cell lymphomas  that show plasmacytic differentiation. Molecular genetic testing for the MYD88 L265P variant may be helpful in this regard, since it is present in more than 90% of cases of lymphoplasmacytic lym- phoma; the mutation promotes tumorigenesis through up-regulated signaling of nuclear factor \u03baB.49 Less than 1% of patients with lymphoplas- macytic lymphoma have CNS involvement, re- ferred to as Bing\u2013Neel syndrome.\n\nFigure 2. Cerebrospinal Fluid Specimen.\nWright\u2013Giemsa staining of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen (Panel A) shows lymphocytes with plasmacytoid features, including relatively abundant cytoplasm and eccentrically placed nuclei. Electrophoresis of the CSF (Panel B) shows a monoclonal band (arrowhead) in the gamma region, a finding indicative of paraprotein. Flow cytometry of the CSF (Panels C and D) shows a population of B cells expressing CD19 and CD20 (Panel C, in red), with kappa re- striction (Panel D, in red in upper left quadrant).\n",
