    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Lena G. Liu (Neurology): A 58-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of progressively worsening confusion and evolving changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 16 months before the current presentation, when confusion and expressive and auditory aphasia devel- oped. She was evaluated at another hospital. The findings of computed tomograph- ic (CT) angiography of the head and neck were reportedly normal. MRI of the head reportedly showed signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated levels of glucose and protein with a normal cell count; nucleic acid testing for herpes simplex virus DNA was negative. Blood and CSF paraneoplastic autoantibody and autoimmune encephalopathy panels were unre- vealing. The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. Screening tests for syphilis and antinuclear antibodies were negative. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing, with no epileptiform discharges. A diagnosis of au- toimmune encephalitis was considered, and treatment included intravenous gluco- corticoids for 5 days, followed by treatment with daily oral prednisone. Expressive aphasia resolved and confusion abated, but auditory aphasia persisted.\nCT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a mass measuring 5 cm in diameter in the pelvis that was composed of fat, soft tissue, and calcifications. Lapa- rotomy was performed, and pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed findings consistent with a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was dis- charged home after a 3-week hospitalization, with a plan to taper the dose of oral prednisone after discharge.\nOne week after the patient\u2019s discharge from the other hospital, after the dose of prednisone had been decreased, malaise developed and confusion recurred. The patient was readmitted to the other hospital. MRI of the head reportedly showed a decrease in the left temporal lobe hyperintensi- ties relative to the previous imaging study. The dose of prednisone was increased, confusion again abated, and the patient was discharged home. The dose of glucocorticoids was gradually tapered.\nSix months before the current presentation, confusion recurred, and the patient was readmitted to the other hospital. Imaging studies were per- formed.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the signal hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe on T2-weighted FLAIR images.\nDr. Liu: A diagnosis of autoimmune encepha- litis was again considered. Treatment with intra- venous glucocorticoids was reinitiated, which resulted in some reduction in confusion. The pa- tient was discharged home with instructions to continue oral prednisone therapy, with a plan to again gradually taper the dose.\nThree months before the current presentation, confusion recurred. The patient was again admit- ted to the other hospital, and imaging studies were repeated.\nDr. Rapalino: MRI of the head reportedly showed progression of the hyperintensities in the left temporal lobe and new signal hyperintensities in the right temporal and left occipital lobes.\nDr. Liu: Treatment with intravenous glucocor- ticoids, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, intra- venous immunoglobulin, and rituximab was initiated. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, with a plan for weekly rituximab infusions for 5 weeks and a 6-week tapering course of daily oral prednisone therapy. Confu- sion resolved and did not recur.\nDr. Rapalino: Three weeks before the current presentation, MRI of the head, which was per- formed to evaluate the response to immunosup- pressive medications, reportedly showed hyper- intensity in both temporal lobes, with extension to the anterior aspects of the parietal lobes, on T2-weighted FLAIR images. Enhancement involv- ing the subinsular regions was present, along with restricted diffusion in the insular cortexes. Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT of the skull base to the midthighs reportedly showed no abnormalities.\nDr. Liu: Two weeks before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by her neurolo- gist in the clinic, who recommended admission to the hospital for additional treatment owing to the progressively worsening findings on head im- aging. One week before the current presentation, she was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment included daily intravenous immunoglobulin for 5 days and mycophenolate mofetil. On the third hospital day, she fell and struck her forehead while walking to the bathroom. On the sixth hospital day, she was transferred to this hospital to poten- tially undergo a brain biopsy.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient reported pain on her forehead where she had struck her head during her fall. Other medical history in- cluded type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sensorineural hearing loss (which had been diag- nosed when she was 45 years of age), and depres- sion. The results of a routine screening colonos- copy that had been performed 4 years before the current presentation had been normal. In addi- tional to mycophenolate mofetil and trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole, medications included ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol, glipizide, magnesium oxide, metoprolol, omeprazole, sertraline, and thiamine. Treatment with metformin had been stopped at the other hospital because the blood level of lactate had been 12.4 mmol per liter (112 mg per deciliter; reference range, 0.5 to 2.0 mmol per liter [4.5 to 18 mg per deciliter]) on presentation. There were no known drug allergies. She had worked in health care until the onset of neuro- logic symptoms 16 months earlier. Before being discharged to the skilled nursing facility, she had lived alone. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. Her mother had had diabetes and had died from heart dis- ease at 59 years of age; she had used hearing aids. Her father had died from heart disease at 78 years of age. Both her brothers had diabetes, along with hearing loss in both ears.\nOn examination, the temporal  temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 154/90 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 157.5 cm, the weight 34 kg, and the body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) 13.7. Ecchymoses and a healing laceration were present on the right side of the forehead. The patient had receptive aphasia, which severely limited her ability to understand oral speech, but she could comprehend written or typed questions. She was alert and interactive and oriented to person, place, and time. Her speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. She was able to follow simple and complex commands without difficulty. Con- centration and attention were intact. No abnor- malities involving the cranial nerves were noted, with the exception of anisocoria; the left pupil measured 5 mm in diameter, and the right pupil measured 3 mm in diameter. Both pupils were reactive to light. The muscle bulk was decreased, but muscle tone and strength were normal. Tests of sensation, deep-tendon reflexes, and cerebellar function showed normal results.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransfer- ase, and total bilirubin were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests. The blood level of lactate was 2.6 mmol per liter. The complete blood count with differential count was normal, except for the level of hemoglobin (11.3 g per deci- liter; reference range, 12.0 to 16.0).\nDr. Rapalino: MRI of the head, performed with the use of a 3-Tesla scanner after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, and mag- netic resonance spectroscopy were performed on admission to this hospital. MRI of the head revealed progressively worsening abnormal subcor- tical enhancement in the insulae (Fig. 1B), left anterior temporal lobe, left posterior gyrus rec- tus (Fig. 1B), left subcallosal gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus. The signal hyperintensities in the insulae on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging had decreased since the previous MRI at the other hospital, whereas the signal hyperintensities in the temporal lobes appeared to be unchanged (Fig. 1A). New signal hyperintensities were seen along the medial aspect of the left anterior fron- tal lobe and in the left anterior cingulate gyrus on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging. No abnormal restricted diffusion, abnormal susceptibility sig- nal, or focal abnormality on dynamic suscepti- bility contrast perfusion maps was noted within the described parenchymal lesions.",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Strokelike Episodes;Maternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Jenny J. Linnoila: This 58-year-old woman initially presented with confusion and expressive and au- ditory aphasia and was found to have signal hyper- intensities in the left temporal lobe on MRI of the head, elevated levels of glucose and protein in the CSF, diffuse slowing on EEG, and a teratoma on pelvic CT. A presumed diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis was made, for which she received glucocorticoids and underwent removal of the teratoma.\nParaneoplastic (autoimmune) encephalitis can develop in patients with teratomas, although this patient was older than most patients with tera- toma-associated autoimmune encephalitis.1,2 Her confusion and expressive aphasia initially abated with glucocorticoid treatment; however, over the course of the next 16 months, confusion recurred and hyperintensities on T2-weighted FLAIR im- ages from MRI of the head progressed and became multifocal, despite repeated courses of treatment with glucocorticoids and escalation of treatment, which included intravenous immunoglobulin and rituximab. When sufficiently treated, patients with autoimmune encephalitis do not typically have a waxing and waning disease course. My first step in evaluating this patient\u2019s current presentation is to revisit the initial diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis.\nAutoimmune Encephalitis\nTo establish a diagnosis of possible autoimmune encephalitis, a patient must meet the following conditions: subacute working memory deficits, altered mental status, or psychiatric symptoms; new focal central nervous system (CNS) findings, new unexplained seizures, CSF pleocytosis, or ab- normalities on MRI of the head that are sugges- tive of encephalitis (e.g., hyperintensities in one or both temporal lobes or in multifocal areas on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging); and other causes must be ruled out.3 Although this patient had altered mental status and MRI findings that were suggestive of encephalitis, several features of her presentation would be atypical for autoimmune encephalitis. Both generalized (instead of focal) slowing on EEG and persistent auditory aphasia would be unexpected in a patient with autoim- mune encephalitis. In addition, the number of hyperintensities identified on this patient\u2019s MRI of the head would be unusual for this condi- tion, unless she had \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)\u2013receptor encephalitis,4,5 which is typically characterized by multiple cortical and subcortical brain lesions, but also by intractable sei- zures, which she did not have. Most important, it is essential to rule out other possible causes of her symptoms because misdiagnosis of autoim- mune encephalitis is associated with patient harm, including delays in the diagnosis and treatment of the true medical issue and complications from adverse effects of unnecessary immunosupressive therapies.6,7\n\nInfection\nSeveral infections involving the CNS are char- acteristically associated with hyperintensities on T2-weighted FLAIR images from MRI of the head. Herpes simplex encephalitis commonly involves the temporal lobes, but it is frequently fulminant. West Nile virus infection most often involves deeper structures, such as the basal ganglia and thalamus, but these regions were not affected in this patient. Toxoplasmosis is usually associated with multifocal lesions, but the lesions are typi- cally ring-enhancing. This patient\u2019s 16-month clinical course was too slow to be explained by these infections. Moreover, the normal CSF white- cell count and the absence of fever in this pre- sumably immunocompetent host make these in- fections unlikely.\nIn addition to the hyperintensities on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging, the restricted diffusion in the insulae that was seen on diffusion-weight- ed imaging prompts consideration of sporadic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease \u2014 a prion disease that can cause both confusion and aphasia as part of a rapidly progressing form of dementia. However, the time course and EEG findings in this patient would be atypical for sporadic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, which usually evolves over weeks to months and is associated with periodic triphasic complexes on EEG.\nThe lactate level remained mildly elevated, at 2.6 mmol per liter, on transfer to this hospital, which may indicate the presence of a mitochondrial dis- order.\nCan mitochondrial disorders mimic autoim- mune encephalitis? Patients with mitochondrial disorders have been reported to have presentations that mirror neuroimmunologic disease, and some of those patients even had a good initial response to glucocorticoid therapy.9 Key features that can help to distinguish patients with mitochondrial disorders from those with autoimmune disease include the absence of CSF pleocytosis, an elevat- ed CSF level of lactate, and a progressively wors- ening relapsing course. We were not given the CSF lactate level in this patient, but the blood level was elevated and her other features could suggest a mitochondrial disorder.\n\nMaternally Inherited Diabetes and Deafness\nGiven the patient\u2019s striking family history, I searched for a known maternally inherited ge- netic disorder that could lead to hearing impair- ment and diabetes. I learned that maternally in- herited diabetes and deafness (MIDD)10-12 arises from a pathogenic variant in mitochondrial DNA. MIDD-associated diabetes usually occurs by the fifth decade of life, but it is not always present at the time of diagnosis of MIDD. MIDD can cause arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, which is intriguing, given that this patient\u2019s moth- er died from unspecified heart disease. MIDD can also cause malabsorption and muscle weakness, which could account for this patient\u2019s low BMI and decreased muscle mass. Reported changes on head imaging in patients with MIDD13 include cerebellar atrophy, which was not seen in this patient. MIDD would not account for this pa- tient\u2019s findings of hyperintensities on T2-weight- ed FLAIR imaging, enhancement, or restricted diffusion on MRI of the head.\n\nCancer\nAutoimmune encephalitis\u2013related inflammation, particularly of the limbic system, can lead to hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobes on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging. Low-grade in- filtrating gliomas can also involve this area of the brain and are an important consideration in this patient, since they can be nonenhancing early in the course of disease. However, this patient\u2019s lesions on MRI of the head progressed over time in a multifocal pattern; by contrast, progression would be expected to occur through contiguous spread in a patient with glioma. CNS lymphoma can be responsive to glucocorticoid therapy and can be multifocal. However, CNS lymphoma is usually contrast-enhancing. This patient\u2019s lesions were nonenhancing until late in her presenta- tion; enhancement was seen on the MRI of the head that was obtained 3 weeks before the cur- rent presentation but not on any of the previous images obtained during her 16-month illness.\nMultifocal Strokes\nStrokes could explain the patient\u2019s neurologic symptoms and hyperintensities on MRI of the head. However, multiple strokes would have need- ed to occur in different vascular territories to account for her MRI findings. Cardiogenic em- boli due to atrial fibrillation or hypercoagulabil- ity can lead to strokes in different vascular territo- ries, as can antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, vasculitis, and cerebral autosomal dominant ar- teriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoen- cephalopathy (CADASIL). CADASIL is of particu- lar interest, given that this patient\u2019s lesions first appeared in the temporal lobe. However, her symptoms were unchanged and repetitive over time and reportedly abated with glucocorticoid treatment, findings that would be unusual for strokes. In addition, lesions caused by acute\n \n\nischemic strokes would be reflected by restricted diffusion on MRI, which was not present on this patient\u2019s MRIs until late in her clinical course.\n\nDemyelinating    and     Inflammatory     Disorder The patient\u2019s lesions on MRI of the head were not in locations that would be typical for demy- elinating disease and were mostly nonenhancing, which would be unexpected. Progressive multi- focal leukoencephalopathy is a demyelinating disease that involves lesions that are typically nonenhancing; however, it is caused by the reac-\ntivation of JC virus in immunosuppressed hosts, and this patient was not known to be immuno- suppressed. Neurosarcoidosis is another possible diagnosis in this patient, especially given the abatement of her symptoms after treatment with glucocorticoids. However, the lesions on MRI of the head were mostly nonenhancing and the CSF white-cell count was normal, neither of which is consistent with neurosarcoidosis.\n\nToxic Exposure or Metabolic Disorder\nPersons with toxic exposures or metabolic disor- ders can have presentations that are similar to that of this patient. However, a toxic cause is un- likely in this patient, owing to the fact that she had repeated episodes, a progressive course, and no known exposures. In addition, the asymmetry of this patient\u2019s lesions on MRI of the head and the lack of involvement of deeper structures, such as the basal ganglia, argues against toxic and metabolic causes.\n\nGenetic Disorder\nSeveral aspects of this patient\u2019s presentation sug- gest the possibility of a maternally inherited ge- netic disorder, specifically a mitochondrial disor- der. The patient\u2019s mother had died relatively early, at 59 years of age. Diabetes and hearing loss were present in the patient, her mother, and her brothers. The patient\u2019s BMI was low, and she had decreased muscle bulk, which is suggestive of a chronic disease. She had anisocoria, which, along with hearing loss, could implicate the involvement of multiple cranial nerves8 and could be consis- tent with a mitochondrial disorder. The patient\u2019s blood lactate level at the other hospital was markedly elevated, at 12.4 mmol per liter. Elevat- ed lactate levels are not uncommon after the occurrence of convulsive seizures, but there was no mention of tonic\u2013clonic activity in this patient.\nMitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Strokelike Episodes\nMELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) is a mitochondrial disease that is associated with hyperintensities on T2-weighted images of the head.14-16 The patient had confusion and muscle wasting (en- cephalomyopathy), lactic acidosis, and expressive aphasia, which is a common neurologic mani- festation of stroke. Lesions that are identified on head MRI in patients with MELAS can involve multiple arterial territories, can migrate over time, and commonly involve the posterior portions of the brain. These lesions may be associated with hyperintensity on T2-weighted imaging, enhance- ment, and restricted diffusion owing to T2 shine- through (a phenomenon in which lesions that appear on T2-weighted imaging are also seen on diffusion-weighted imaging). These features all fit with this patient\u2019s presentation. Patients with MELAS can also have seizures, hearing loss, and diabetes. However, MELAS is mostly evident by young adulthood; it is diagnosed by 40 years of age in 90% of patients. This patient had senso- rineural hearing loss that had been diagnosed when she was 45 years of age, but the remainder of her neurologic symptoms did not start until the middle of her sixth decade of life.\nAre there shared pathogenic variants between\nMIDD and MELAS? Patients with an alanine-to- guanine pathogenic variant at mitochondrial DNA position 3243 in MT-TL1, the gene that en- codes transfer RNA Leu, commonly present with MELAS.10 Patients with this variant can have a wide range of symptoms \u2014 including neurologic, cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and psychi- atric abnormalities \u2014 in addition to other mito- chondrial syndromes, such as MIDD, which is also associated with this variant.8,17\nThe most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s presentation is a mitochondrial disease associ- ated with features that are consistent with a mixed picture of MELAS and MIDD due to the m.3243A\u2192G pathogenic variant in MT-TL1. To confirm this diagnosis, I would perform a muscle biopsy to look for ragged-red fibers, which are characteristic features of mitochondrial disease, and genetic testing to identify pathogenic variants in the patient\u2019s mitochondrial DNA.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Rapalino: MRI of the head, performed with the use of a 3-Tesla scanner after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, and mag- netic resonance spectroscopy were performed on admission to this hospital. MRI of the head revealed progressively worsening abnormal subcor- tical enhancement in the insulae (Fig. 1B), left anterior temporal lobe, left posterior gyrus rec- tus (Fig. 1B), left subcallosal gyrus, and left cingulate gyrus. The signal hyperintensities in the insulae on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging had decreased since the previous MRI at the other hospital, whereas the signal hyperintensities in the temporal lobes appeared to be unchanged (Fig. 1A). New signal hyperintensities were seen along the medial aspect of the left anterior fron- tal lobe and in the left anterior cingulate gyrus on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging. No abnormal restricted diffusion, abnormal susceptibility sig- nal, or focal abnormality on dynamic suscepti- bility contrast perfusion maps was noted within the described parenchymal lesions.\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy was requested by the inpatient team for further meta- bolic characterization of the parenchymal signal abnormalities. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed with the use of a multivoxel tech- nique with short (30 msec) echo times to target the central brain parenchyma and ventricular system (Fig. 1E and 1F). A single voxel technique with long (270 msec) echo times was used to target the abnormalities in the left temporal lobe (Fig. 1C and 1D). A mild elevation in the ratio of choline to creatine was present; this is a nonspe- cific finding that can be seen with many diseases and probably reflects mildly increased cellular membrane turnover. Prominent lactate peaks were present within the areas of parenchymal signal abnormalities (Fig. 1D) and in the lateral ven- tricles (Fig. 1F). The elevated lactate levels in the brain parenchyma and in the ventricular system suggest the possibility of an underlying meta- bolic disorder, particularly a mitochondrial dis- order. No additional abnormalities were noted in the acquired spectra.\n",
