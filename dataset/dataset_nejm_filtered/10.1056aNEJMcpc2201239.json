    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Yousef R. Badran: A 72-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of heartburn, nausea, and the inability to eat solid and liquid food.\nThe patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The symptoms had been well controlled with the use of daily omeprazole therapy until 11 months before this admission, when heartburn recurred despite treatment. At that time, the patient also noticed nausea after eating and early satiation. During the next 9 months, the heartburn and nausea slowly increased in severity. To help manage his symptoms, the patient adjusted his diet from solid food to soft solid food.\nTwo months before this admission, the patient sought evaluation at the gastro- enterology clinic of another hospital. The glycated hemoglobin level was 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 5.6). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. Although the patient had not eaten food for 24 hours before the procedure, the stomach could not be adequately visualized because there was a large amount of residual food; no intraluminal masses were seen.\nA scintigraphy study of gastric emptying was performed. During the study, 88% of the gastric contents were retained at 1 hour, 88% at 2 hours, 81% at 3 hours, and 80% at 4 hours. In a patient with normal gastric emptying, less than 60% of the gastric contents would be retained at 2 hours and less than 10% at 4 hours. Thus, the results were consistent with severely delayed gastric emptying. The pa- tient was told that he had idiopathic gastroparesis and underwent trials of several medications. Ondansetron caused constipation, erythromycin caused burning while swallowing and abdominal cramping, and metoclopramide and scopolamine did not lead to a decrease in the patient\u2019s symptoms.\nDuring the 2 months after the evaluation in the gastroenterology clinic, the patient adjusted his diet from soft solid food to blended solid food. Two weeks before this admission, he adjusted his diet to primarily liquid food, such as nutri- tional supplement drinks, protein shakes, and ice cream. When the patient was no longer able to drink liquids, he sought evaluation at the emergency department of the other hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient described epigas- tric burning and nausea after eating. He had lost\n13.6 kg of weight in the preceding year, including\n5.4 kg in the past 2 weeks. He had no recent his- tory of illness, night sweats, vomiting, dysphagia, odynophagia, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.\nDr. David A. Rosman: Computed tomography\n(CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patulous esopha- gus, along with wall thickening in scattered areas of the upper and lower segments of the esophagus. There was abnormal circumferential wall thickening (\u226413 mm) in the stomach, par- ticularly at the antrum, incisura, and pyloric canal (Fig. 1). The antrum was decompressed or nonexpansile, and the rest of the stomach was distended. There were multiple bilateral pulmo- nary nodules (\u22645 mm in diameter) and multiple hepatic hypodensities (<10 mm in diameter), as well as a pancreatic cyst (5 mm in diameter) and an exophytic renal lesion (8 mm in diameter).\nDr.  Badran:  A  nasogastric  tube  was inserted.\nTreatment with intravenous pantoprazole was started, and intravenous lorazepam was administered for nausea. The patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDuring the subsequent week, the patient re- ceived vitamin and mineral supplements for severe malnutrition. He remained unable to drink liquids. On the 7th hospital day, a peripherally inserted central catheter was placed, and total parenteral nutrition was administered. The pa- tient was monitored for refeeding syndrome. On the 15th hospital day, he was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nOn transfer to this hospital, additional his- tory was obtained. The patient had a history of prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, divertic- ulosis, glaucoma, and basal cell carcinoma of the ear that had been resected. Five years before this admission, EGD had revealed a widely patent Schatzki\u2019s ring, an irregular-appearing Z line, and a few gastric polyps; examination of an esophageal biopsy specimen had revealed no abnormalities. Colonoscopy had shown two tubular adenomas. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery, but there was no history of abdominal surgery. Medications included omeprazole, lisinopril, atorvastatin, vitamin D supplements, and bimatoprost and bromonidine eye drops. Sulfa drugs had caused a rash.\nThe patient lived with his wife in a rural area of New England. He had previously served in the military and currently worked as a biotechnolo- gist. He had never smoked tobacco, and he drank alcohol rarely. His mother and paternal aunt had died of colon cancer, his father of lung cancer, his maternal grandmother of breast can- cer, and his maternal grandfather of prostate cancer. His two children and two grandchildren were healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was thin and had a nasogastric tube in place. He had normal mood, affect, and insight. The abdomen was flat, soft, and nondistended, with mild ten- derness in the epigastrium on palpation. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Distal sen- sory and motor function were normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nFigure 1. CT Scan of the Abdomen.\nCT was performed after the administration of intrave\u2011 nous contrast material. An axial image (Panel A) shows wall thickening at the antrum (arrowhead) and second\u2011 ary distention of the stomach (arrow). An additional axial image (Panel B) shows circumferential wall thick\u2011 ening at the incisura and pyloric canal (arrowhead). A coronal image (Panel C) shows the antral thickening (arrowhead) and gastric distention (arrow).\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Kyle D. Staller: This 72-year-old man presented with heartburn and nausea with the progressive inability to tolerate solids and liquids. How can the patient\u2019s symptoms help us understand the underlying process?\n\nHeartburn\nThe predominant mechanism of gastroesopha- geal reflux is thought to be transient relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, but there are other mechanisms, including impaired esopha- geal clearance, anatomical disruption of the lower esophageal sphincter complex, and delayed gas- tric emptying. This patient was known to have retention of gastric contents, and such retention can increase the likelihood of reflux and associ- ated heartburn. In addition, he had gastric-wall thickening, which could suggest disruption of the intricate network of clasplike sling  fibers that originate from the upper stomach and form part of the normal barrier to reflux.\n\nEarly Satiation\nSatiation is a feeling of fullness that occurs dur- ing a meal and controls the size of the meal. Satiation is not to be confused with satiety,\n",
