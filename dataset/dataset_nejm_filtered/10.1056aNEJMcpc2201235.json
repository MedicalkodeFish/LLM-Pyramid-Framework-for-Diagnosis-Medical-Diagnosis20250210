    "Primary Symptom": "An 11-Year-Old Girl with Redness of the Eyes",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Natalie A. Diacovo (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheuma- tology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.\nThe patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing, or discharge. The patient\u2019s parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hos- pital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.\nFive weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treat- ment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital. The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were sym- metric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp ex- amination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes,  with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.\nDuring the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatrics clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed hilar fullness.\nDr. Maria G. Figueiro Longo: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (Fig. 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, showed a normal-appearing thymus. However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measur- ing 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm.\nDr. Diacovo: Two weeks before the current evalu-\nation, the patient was asked to present to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath, or joint pain. On examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 100% while she was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.3.\nThe patient appeared well, with no oral le- sions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged. Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipi- tates and white cells in the anterior chamber of\n \nboth eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive poste- rior synechiae in the right eye. Funduscopic ex- amination (Fig. 2) showed vitreous white cells, optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, periph- eral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation. Urinalysis was normal. Other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1. Methylprednisolone was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.\nDuring the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swell- ing but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluorescein angiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some ves- sel leakage.\nDr. Figueiro Longo: Magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) of the head (Fig. 1C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed protrusion and enhance- ment of the optic disks and enhancement of the irises, a finding consistent with the clinical diag- nosis of uveitis. There was no evidence of optic neuritis or perineuritis.\nDr. Diacovo: The administration of cyclopento-\nlate eye drops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes was continued. Treatment with oral prednisone was started, and a regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazin- amide was begun as empirical treatment for pos- sible tuberculosis. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home. She was instruct- ed to follow up in the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital and was referred to the rheumatol- ogy clinic of this hospital.\nIn the rheumatology clinic, additional history was obtained. The patient had had normal growth and development and was currently in middle school. She had received all routine childhood vaccinations. She had emigrated from West Africa to the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had re- ceived a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the pa- tient\u2019s parents could not recall giving the medica- tion to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient\u2019s parents were healthy.\n\nTable 1.

Initial Imaging Studies.\nCT of the chest and abdomen was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A cor\u2011 onal image of the chest (Panel A) shows mediastinal lymphadenopathy (arrow). An axial image of the abdo\u2011 men (Panel B) shows retroperitoneal lymphadenopa\u2011 thy (arrow). MRI of the head was performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An ax\u2011 ial T1\u2011weighted fat\u2011suppressed image of the orbits (Panel C) shows enhancement of the irises, with great\u2011 er enhancement in the right globe (arrow) than in the left globe, a finding consistent with the clinical diagno\u2011 sis of uveitis.\n\nDr. Diacovo: One year after the patient was evalated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital and 3 months after she completed a 9-month course of medication for possible tuberculosis, a \u201cwobbly\u201d gait developed while she was receiving therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (1500 mg per day). The walking difficulty worsened, such that the patient had to hold her mother\u2019s arm to walk. The patient\u2019s parents called the rheumatology clinic, and a telemedicine visit was arranged promptly. On examination during the video call, the patient was observed to have a bilateral Trendelenburg gait. She could not stand on one leg, stand on her toes, or squat. She was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nIn the emergency department, the patient de- scribed aching pain in the lower back and both hips and weakness in the lower legs that had developed 10 days earlier. She reported no fever, vision changes, sensation changes, incontinence, recent illness, or trauma. Four weeks before this evaluation, she had received a seasonal influenza vaccination. On examination, she appeared well. There was profound weakness on eversion of the right ankle, dorsiflexion of both ankles, and flex- ion of the left knee and both hips. Strength and reflexes in the arms were normal, as was sensation in response to light touch, pain, temperature, and vibration. Results of finger-to-nose testing were normal; the Romberg sign and the Babinski reflex were absent. There was a wide-based gait, and the right foot dragged more than the left foot. Dr. Figueiro Longo: MRI of the lumbar spine (Fig. 3A and 3B), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an enhancing, T2-hyperintense intra- medullary lesion in the lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris. There was also smooth thickening and enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots. MRI of the head (Fig. 3C), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominence of the lacrimal glands.\n\n\nFigure 3.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Danielle B. Pier: I participated in the care of this patient and am aware of the final diagnosis. This patient presented with weakness in the lower legs that was affecting ambulation. Strength was pre- served elsewhere, so a cerebral or cervical lesion seemed unlikely. Sensation was spared, and re- flexes were preserved initially. The Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome was considered briefly, given her history of recent vaccination, although preserved reflexes are not consistent with this diagnosis. Spinal imaging then revealed an expansile lesion at the level of T12\u2013L1 that extended into the cauda equina nerve roots, a finding suggestive of a myeloradicu- lopathy. The Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome does not involve the spinal cord and thus was ruled out in this case. The findings on imaging were also not consistent with ischemia or hemorrhage. The most likely causes of this patient\u2019s lower-leg weak- ness were infection, neoplasm, and autoimmune disease.\n\nInfection\nThe patient had recently completed a 9-month course of antituberculosis medication. She had also received immunosuppressive therapy, which increased her risk of infection. Tuberculosis with spinal cord involvement commonly manifests as a myeloradiculopathy, although other possible mani- festations include intramedullary or extramedul- lary tuberculomas, spinal abscesses, acute myelitis, longitudinal extensive transverse myelitis, syringo- myelia, cauda equina syndrome, and spinal cord infarction.4 This patient had lived in the northeast- ern United States for the previous 6 years, so neu- roborreliosis was another consideration, but the absence of cranial nerve involvement would be unusual and a screening test for Lyme disease was negative. Other infections \u2014 such as syphilis and cytomegalovirus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, HIV, and JC virus infections \u2014 can manifest as a myeloradiculopathy in rare cases, such as cases in which the patient is severely immunocompromised. Fungal and par- asitic infections can involve the spinal cord and nerve roots, although the development of brain lesions would be more common.\n\nNeoplasm\nA primary spinal cord tumor was unlikely in this patient because the symptoms had developed just 10 days earlier. Perhaps a particularly aggressive tumor, such as a diffuse fibrillary astrocytoma, could progress this quickly, but symptoms of pri- mary spinal cord tumors most often develop over a period of months to years. Also, most primary spinal cord tumors, including low-grade gliomas and ependymomas, have discrete margins.5 Germ- cell tumors were another consideration in this patient, although they are more likely to occur  in the suprasellar region with subsequent spread to the spinal cord. Of note, germ-cell tumors can cause granulomatous inflammation that can mim- ic other granulomatous diseases.6 Many malignant spinal cord lesions originate from solid organ tumors, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, or leukemia. Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma typically develops in the brain, but CNS lymphoma with isolated spinal cord involvement has been reported.7\n\nAutoimmune Disease\nNeuroimmunologic conditions most often involve the CNS, but peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement has been reported with some disor- ders, including multiple sclerosis,8 neuromyelitis optica,9 disorders associated with antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG),10 disorders associated with antibodies to glial fi- brillary acidic protein (GFAP),11 and transverse myelitis.12 Because this patient had recently re- ceived a clinical diagnosis of uveitis, a systemic condition affecting the spinal cord was the most likely cause of her leg weakness. Such conditions include sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, common variable immunode- ficiency,13 and systemic vasculitides.14\nSarcoidosis was the most likely diagnosis, given her recent episode of uveitis. Like tubercu- losis, sarcoidosis can affect any part of the neuro- logic system and thus can cause almost any neurologic sign or symptom, including meningeal inflammation (aseptic meningitis), cerebral or cerebellar lesions, neuroendocrine dysfunction, optic chiasm compression, brainstem lesions, cranial neuropathies, spinal cord lesions, conus medullaris or cauda equina syndrome, radicu- lopathy, polyneuropathy, myopathy, and cerebro- vascular accidents related to vascular inflamma- tion.15 Although this patient\u2019s blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme was normal, no serum or cerebrospinal fluid test can either con- firm or rule out  the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.16  On the basis of the 2018 proposed diagnostic criteria for CNS and PNS neurosarcoidosis,17 it became apparent that this patient should un- dergo a tissue biopsy. MRI of the head had shown prominent lacrimal glands, so we opted for a lac- rimal gland biopsy because it was the least inva- sive approach to establishing the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.",
