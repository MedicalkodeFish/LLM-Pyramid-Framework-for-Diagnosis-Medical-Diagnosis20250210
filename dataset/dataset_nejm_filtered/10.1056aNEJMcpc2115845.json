    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Nilay K. Patel: A 62-year-old woman was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 months before the current admission, when pleuritic pain and tightness in her chest developed sud- denly while she was eating. The chest pain persisted and began to radiate to the neck and back. The symptoms did not abate with aspirin or acetaminophen. Within an hour after symptom onset, she noticed that the pain worsened with exertion and when she was in the supine position; she was also unable to take a full breath and had dizziness with exertion. She presented to the emergency de- partment of another hospital.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 104 beats per minute, the blood pressure 120/91 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Except for the finding of tachycardia, the examination was reportedly normal. The prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electro- lytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed ST-segment elevation and T-wave inversion in the anterior and inferior leads. A chest radiograph reportedly showed a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Intravenous heparin was administered. Four hours later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly ruled out pulmonary embolism; it also revealed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion with an attenuation level of 34 to 50 Hounsfield units, a mildly dilated ascending aorta (at  a diameter of   37 mm; normal diameter, <36 mm on the basis of the patient\u2019s sex and body- surface area), and a pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe that measured 4 mm in diameter. Intravenous heparin was stopped, and protamine sulfate was administered. The patient was transferred to the emer- gency department of a second hospital 3 hours later.\nOn arrival at the second hospital, the temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the heart rate 101 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/75 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 4 liters per minute. Pulsus paradoxus measured 16 mm Hg. The jugular venous pressure was 12 cm of water. Ausculta- tion revealed tachycardia and a pericardial fric- tion rub. The remainder of the examination was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the level of troponin were normal. An ECG showed sinus tachycardia and right-axis devia- tion, with minor nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.\nDr. Daniela R. Crousillat: A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a small-to-moderate circumferential pericardial effusion primarily abut- ting the right atrium and right ventricle with right atrial inversion and intermittent diastolic inversion of the right ventricle (Fig. 1A). There was increased respiratory variation in the mitral inflow velocities and a dilated inferior vena cava with reduced respirophasic collapse; both these features were suggestive of the presence of physi- ologic characteristics of early tamponade (Fig. 1B and Video 1). Colchicine and ibuprofen were administered, and the patient was admitted to the second hospital.\nDr. Patel: The next morning, pericardiocentesis was performed under fluoroscopic guidance with the use of a subxiphoid approach, and 200 ml of bloody fluid was drained; the intrapericardial pressure decreased from 12 mm Hg to 4 mm Hg. Analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed 4,700,000 erythrocytes per microliter and 12,010 nucleated cells per microliter, of which 78% were neutro- phils, 13% monocytes, 8% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Gram\u2019s staining revealed neutro- phils and no organisms. The pericardial fluid albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter, the total protein level 4.7 g per deciliter, the lactate dehy- drogenase level 614 U per liter, the glucose level 71 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter), and the amylase level 31 U per liter.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: On the second hospital day, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the chest showed a re- duction  in  hemopericardium,  and  a pericardial drain was visible; there was no aortic dissection. There was an atrial septal occluder device in place that appeared to be in an appropriate posi- tion. The device appeared to be relatively large and abutted the aortic root anteriorly (Fig. 1C). However, there was no evidence of erosion of the device into the aortic wall (known as device ero- sion) or pseudoaneurysm formation (Fig. 1D).\nDr. Patel: On the third hospital day, no pericar-\n \ndial effusion was detected on TTE. Cytologic analysis of the pericardial fluid revealed reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils, with no malignant cells. The pa- tient was discharged home with prescriptions for colchicine and ibuprofen.\nTen days after discharge from the second hos- pital, the patient had a follow-up visit with her cardiologist and reported that the chest pain and dyspnea had resolved. The heart rate was 94 beats per minute, the blood pressure 159/88 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breathing ambient air; the remainder of the ex- amination was normal. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, with a homogeneous pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. CT of the chest, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume pericardial effusion, mild bronchial wall thickening, and a 4-mm pulmo- nary nodule in the right lower lobe. Colchicine treatment was stopped.\nSix weeks before the current admission, the patient called her primary care physician to re- port recurrent back pain and dyspnea that she noted were similar to her previous presentation; treatment with colchicine was resumed. During the next 12 days, sinus pressure, myalgias, nasal congestion, and cough productive of green spu- tum developed, and she was seen by her primary care physician. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 112 beats per minute, the blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 94% while she was breathing ambient air. The remainder of the examination was reportedly normal. A screening test for respiratory viruses was negative. A chest radiograph reportedly showed clear lungs. Doxy- cycline was prescribed.\nFour days before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by her cardiologist at this hospital and reported ongoing cough and dys- pnea. The heart rate was 87 beats per minute, and the blood pressure was 138/100 mm Hg. The remainder of the examination was normal. Dr. Crousillat: A TTE showed recurrence of a moderate pericardial effusion, measuring up to 14 mm in end diastole, that was adjacent to the right ventricular free wall. There was evidence of right ventricular diastolic inversion that was sug- gestive of the physiologic characteristics of tam- ponade (Fig. 2A and 2B). The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor of this hospital.\nDr. Patel: On evaluation, the patient reported that she had had episodes of dyspnea and cough with sputum production and a decrease in exer- cise tolerance in the weeks before this admis- sion. She had no known sick contacts.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for postoperative pulmonary embolism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent episodes of syncope with cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor respons- es on tilt testing, asthma, obstructive sleep ap- nea (for which she used a continuous positive airway pressure device), obesity, tubular adenomas (colonic polyps), hepatic steatosis, hiatal hernia, osteopenia, and cataracts. She also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; on   previous   pulmonary-function   testing, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 0.92  liters (39%  of the predicted value),  and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was 47%. Five and a half years before the current admission, the patient had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and abdominoplasty that had resulted in postoperative hemorrhage; she had lost 44 kg of weight after the sleeve gastrectomy.\nFourteen years before this admission, the patient had undergone percutaneous transcatheter clo- sure of a fenestrated atrial septal defect (ASD) with an interatrial septal aneurysm and a right- to-left shunt that was possibly related to recur- rent transient ischemic attacks; the procedure had been performed with a 30-mm Amplatzer septal occluder device. She had had mammography and cervical cancer screening within the 16 months before this admission.\nMedications included colchicine, apixaban, losartan, theophylline, calcium, vitamin D, vita- min B12, a multivitamin, and inhaled tiotropium and mometasone\u2013formoterol, as well as furosemide and albuterol as needed. Topiramate had caused paresthesia. The patient lived in Massa- chusetts with her husband and was a business owner. She had a 40-pack-year history of ciga- rette smoking and had quit smoking 10 years earlier; she did not drink alcohol or use other substances. Her family history was notable for coronary artery disease in her mother and fa- ther, stroke in her maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather, and seizure in a nephew.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the heart rate 120 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/81 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Pulsus paradoxus measured 10 mm Hg. The height was 163 cm and the weight 67 kg; the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.2. On examination, the jugular venous pres- sure was 10 cm of water. Auscultation revealed tachycardia, with no murmur or rub. The re- mainder of the examination was normal.\nThe prothrombin time, international normal- ized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of tests of liver and kidney function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An ECG showed irregular tachycardia of uncertain underlying rhythm, low voltage in the limb leads, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and a rightward axis.\n\nTable 1.

Imaging Studies Obtained before This Admission.\nOn TTE, a subcostal view (Panel A) shows a small\u2011to\u2011moderate free\u2011wall circumferential pericardial effusion (arrow) primarily abutting the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) with right atrial inversion and intermittent, early diastolic inversion of the right ventricle. A pulsed\u2011wave Doppler echocardiogram of the mitral inflow pattern in the apical four\u2011chamber view (Panel B) shows increased respiratory variation in mitral early\u2011filling (E\u2011wave) velocities (arrows) that is consistent with interventricular dependence and increased intrapericardial pressure. On CT angiog\u2011 raphy of the chest (Panels C and D), a reformatted maximum\u2011intensity\u2011projection image in the \u201ccandy cane\u201d view (Panel C) shows mild atherosclerotic calcifications with no evidence of an intraluminal flap that would be sugges\u2011 tive of aortic dissection. There is an atrial septal occluder device in place (Panel C, asterisk). Only minimal fluid is seen in the pericardial space (axial plane, Panel D, asterisk), a finding that suggests resolution of hemopericardium. A pericardial drain is in place (Panel D, white arrow). The occluder device abuts the aortic root anteriorly (Panel D, black arrow), without evidence of device erosion into the aortic wall or pseudoaneurysm formation. LA denotes left atrium, and LV left ventricle.\n\nFigure 2. Echocardiograms Obtained on This Admission.\nOn TTE, a parasternal long\u2011axis view (Panel A) shows recurrence of a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion predominantly adjacent to the right ventricle (arrow). An M\u2011mode echocardiogram (Panel B) shows diastolic inver\u2011 sion of the right ventricle (arrow) indicative of increased intrapericardial pressures. Ao denotes aorta, and RVOT right ventricular outflow tract.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Evin Yucel: This 62-year-old woman, with a his- tory of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, a complicated abdominoplasty, and percutaneous trans- catheter closure of a fenestrated ASD, presented with recurrent symptomatic hemorrhagic peri- cardial effusion. Her presentation was subacute, with evidence of the physiologic characteristics of tamponade on TTE.\n\nCardiac Tamponade\nCardiac tamponade is a cardiac emergency, in which there is often rapid accumulation of peri- cardial fluid resulting in a sudden increase in intrapericardial pressure. When the intrapericar- dial pressure exceeds the intracardiac pressures, the atrial and ventricular walls invert, which initially results in a decrease in diastolic filling and eventually a decrease in cardiac output. If cardiac tamponade is left untreated, cardiogenic shock ensues, which can result in death. De- pending on the clinical scenario, pericardiocen- tesis can be performed for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes.\n\nHemorrhagic Pericardial Effusion\nAlthough there are many causes of pericardial effusion, in this patient, we can quickly narrow the differential diagnosis on the basis of the hemorrhagic nature of the effusion. Viral infec- tions, metabolic abnormalities (e.g., uremia and hypothyroidism), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclero- sis, and mixed connective-tissue disease) are common causes of pericardial effusion; however, these conditions often lead to transudative and nonhemorrhagic effusions.\nAortic dissection leading to aortic-wall injury and penetrating trauma are two devastating causes of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and usually develop very abruptly. This patient did not have a recent history of trauma, and aortic dissection was ruled out with the CTA scan of the chest.\nMyocardial infarction complicated by free- wall rupture resulting in cardiac tamponade also develops suddenly. This patient\u2019s ECG did not show any ischemic changes, her troponin levels were normal, and TTE did not reveal any wall- motion abnormalities; these findings make this diagnosis unlikely.\nAlthough uncommon in the United States, tuberculous pericarditis can occur in patients with tuberculosis and could cause hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.1 This patient did not have constitutional symptoms before her initial pre- sentation, and chest imaging did not show find- ings consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. However, some studies have shown that patients with tuberculous pericarditis may not have clas- sic signs and symptoms of pulmonary tubercu- losis.2,3 Another clue to assist in the diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis would be a lymphocytic and monocytic cell predominance in the pericar- dial fluid; however, this patient\u2019s pericardial fluid had a predominance of neutrophils. Diag- nosis of tuberculous pericarditis can be challeng- ing because a mycobacterial (acid-fast bacilli) smear of the pericardial fluid can be negative in up to 60% of patients with this condition.4 Ad- ditional testing of adenosine deaminase activity in the pericardial fluid could be performed.2,5\nIn the United States, metastatic disease is  a\ncommon cause of symptomatic hemorrhagic peri- cardial effusion. Lung, breast, and esophageal cancers are the most common, whereas mela- noma, lymphoma, leukemia, and acquired immu- nodeficiency syndrome\u2013related Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma are less common.6,7 The diagnostic utility of cy- tologic analysis of pericardial fluid is well estab- lished; although its sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignant effusion is variable, it has a speci- ficity of 100%, and therefore it is important to perform this analysis in all patients with hemor- rhagic effusion.6,8,9 In addition, immunohisto- chemical staining could detect malignant cells and can aid in differentiating among various tissues of origin. Pericardial biopsy is reserved for patients with a high probability of cancer who have already undergone nondiagnostic cyto- logic analysis and immunohistochemical stain- ing of the pericardial fluid. This patient had a recent negative mammogram and cervical cancer screening. Although she had been a smoker,there was no lymphadenopathy on chest imaging, and only a 4-mm nodule in the right lower lobe was noted. Cytologic testing of the pericar- dial fluid was reportedly negative for cancer. Therefore, a malignant pericardial effusion is unlikely.\nPercutaneous cardiac procedures, such as pace- maker implantation, coronary angioplasty, pro- cedures that involve interatrial septostomy, and transcatheter valve interventions, can also cause hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and often re- sult in a sudden onset of this condition. This patient had undergone percutaneous ASD closure 14 years earlier. Device erosion leading to cardiac perforation has been described and most often occurs within 6 months after the closure procedure, although there are case reports docu- menting the occurrence of device erosion up to 3 years after the closure procedure.10,11\nFor this patient, it would be helpful to review the original intraprocedural echocardiographic imaging to evaluate the anterior interatrial sep- tal tissue rim, since a deficient anterior rim has been proposed as one of the predictors of device erosion into the aorta. On the CT scan, the Am- platzer septal occluder device appeared to be too large for the size of her current interatrial sep- tum, a finding that also introduces the possibil- ity of device erosion. In addition, the patient had had successful weight-loss  surgery more  than 8 years after the implantation of the device. A few reports have shown a clinically significant reduction in the left atrial area and volume among patients who have undergone weight-loss surgery.12,13 Lastly, we know that the patient had had complications after abdominal surgery. It would be essential to review the imaging find- ings with the radiologist to evaluate for dia- phragmatic paralysis, which, if present, could also have distorted her cardiac anatomy and led to erosion of the device.\nMy diagnosis is device erosion due to remodeling of the left atrium, leading to the subacute accumulation of pericardial fluid. Transesopha- geal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac CT, or car- diac magnetic resonance imaging could be help- ful in establishing a definitive diagnosis; however, given that the patient\u2019s presentation was subacute, flow into the pericardium may not be vi- sualized with these imaging studies.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Crousillat: TTE revealed a well-aligned and appropriately positioned Amplatzer septal occluder device. There was no evidence of impingement or distortion of the aorta by the device. The disks of the device appeared to protrude posteriorly into the visceral pericardium, without  evidence of active extravasation of blood into the pericardial space on color Doppler imaging.\nDr. Baliyan: Gated cardiac CTA (Fig. 3D, 3E, and 3F and Videos 5 and 6) revealed a moderate hemorrhagic pericardial effusion. The Amplatzer septal occluder device appeared unchanged in position relative to the previous CTA. The device again abutted the aortic root anteriorly and the atrial wall posteriorly. However, there was no evidence of active extravasation of contrast ma- terial into the pericardial space.\n\nFigure 3 (facing page). Additional Imaging Studies Obtained during This Admission.\nOn TEE, a midesophageal short\u2011axis view from a 35\u2011 degree imaging plane (Panel A) shows the presence of an Amplatzer septal occluder device that appears well aligned and in a stable position. Anteriorly (A), the de\u2011 vice directly abuts the aorta; however, there is no evi\u2011 dence of impingement or distortion of the aorta. Poste\u2011 riorly (P), the extent of the device is not fully visualized. A midesophageal four\u2011chamber view from a 39\u2011degree imaging plane (Panel B) shows that the disks of the de\u2011 vice appear to protrude into the visceral pericardium (arrow). There is fluid in the pericardial space that is suggestive of possible device erosion. On color Dop\u2011 pler imaging (Panel C), there is no evidence of active extravasation of blood into the pericardial space. Refor\u2011 matted multiphasic CT images in a four\u2011chamber view are shown without contrast enhancement (Panel D), in the arterial phase (Panel E), and in the delayed phase (Panel F). There is a moderate pericardial effusion of high attenuation with hemorrhagic contents (Panel D, white asterisk). The Amplatzer septal occluder device (Panel D, black asterisk) appears unchanged in posi\u2011 tion relative to the previous nongated CTA performed more than 3 months earlier. The device closely abuts the posterior atrial wall (Panels D and E, arrows), but there is no extravasation of contrast material into the pericardial space that would suggest frank erosion. A small fat pad was also visualized posterior to the device (Panel F, arrow).\n",
