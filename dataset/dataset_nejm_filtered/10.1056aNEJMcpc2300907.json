    "Primary Symptom": "A 50-Year-Old Woman with Confusion",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Grace R. Bobkowski (Medicine): A 50-year-old woman was admitted to this hospi- tal because of confusion.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 5 months before the current presentation, when dysphagia developed. One month later, she was evalu- ated by her primary care physician. She reported having a sensation that pills and food were getting stuck in her throat when she swallowed. She was unable to take her medications, and her food intake had decreased to two eggs per day. She esti- mated that her weight had decreased by 5 kg during the previous month. She was referred for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which reportedly revealed ulcer- ation of the gastrojejunal junction from a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass performed 12 years earlier but otherwise normal mucosa. Examination of biopsy specimens obtained during the procedure reportedly revealed findings consistent with lym- phocytic esophagitis. Treatment with swallowed fluticasone was recommended.\nThree months before the current presentation, leg swelling developed, and the patient was again evaluated by her primary care physician. She had stopped using fluticasone after 1 week of treatment because she had not noticed any decrease in the dysphagia. Her weight had decreased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month earlier. Pitting edema was present in the legs. A diagnosis of chronic venous insuf- ficiency was considered, and compression stockings were recommended.\nTwo months before the current presentation, leg swelling worsened, arm swell- ing developed, and the patient had trouble performing activities of daily living. She was admitted to another hospital. She reported persistent dysphagia and reduced food intake. Her weight had increased by 3 kg since the evaluation 1 month ear- lier. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The blood albumin level was\n2.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.5 to 4.8), and the zinc level was 0.36 \u03bcg per milliliter (reference range, 0.66 to 1.10). Blood levels of vitamin B2, vitamin B12, folate, and methylmalonate were normal; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type\nnatriuretic peptide was normal for the patient\u2019s age. Urinalysis revealed trace ketones but was otherwise normal. The albumin:creatinine ratio in a random urine sample was 11.6 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine (reference value, <30.0). Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAbdominal ultrasonography reportedly revealed an echogenic liver, a finding consistent with fatty infiltration, as well as trace free fluid. Pit- ting edema of the arms and legs was attributed to hypoalbuminemia from limited oral intake, which was related to dysphagia from untreated lymphocytic esophagitis. The use of fluticasone was encouraged, and supplemental nutritional drinks were recommended, along with a multi- vitamin and zinc sulfate. On the fourth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\nOne month before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to this hospital be- cause of confusion and a urinary tract infection (UTI)  with  Escherichia coli.  Confusion  resolved with treatment of the UTI. Her weight had de- creased by 2 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. The patient reported loose stools without blood or mucus, which had occurred for 1 month. Edema was present. The blood albumin level was 1.7 g per deciliter, the zinc level 0.3 \u03bcg per milliliter, the selenium level 34 ng per milliliter (reference range, 70 to 150), the vitamin A level\n16.6 \u03bcg per deciliter (reference range, 32.5 to 78.0), and the vitamin C level 0.2 mg per decili- ter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Blood levels of vitamin B1   and vitamin B3   were normal. Other\nlaboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nEGD showed ulceration of the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. Bi- opsy specimens of the esophagus, stomach, and jejunum showed normal mucosa. A biopsy spec- imen of the gastrojejunal anastomosis showed small-intestinal mucosa with erosion and non- specific morphologic features; periodic acid\u2013 Schiff staining was negative for microorganisms, Congo red staining was negative for amyloid, and immunohistochemical staining was nega- tive for cytomegalovirus. Magnetic resonance en- terography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed with and without the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed no evidence of active inflammatory bowel disease. A high-protein diet was recommended, along with a multivita- min, zinc sulfate, and selenium. On the eighth hospital day, the patient was discharged home.\n \nAfter discharge, the patient initially felt well. The edema abated, and her appetite improved. She began to have six small meals and three protein shakes per day. Two weeks after dis- charge, and 1 week before the current presenta- tion, confusion developed, and the gait became unsteady; she began using a walker for ambula- tion. During the next week, confusion increased, and she fell while walking. Her family brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency de- partment, she was unable to answer questions about her history. Her family reported that she had had slowed and slurred speech for the past week and increasing difficulty with attention, including difficulty with holding a conversation. Other medical history included chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, seizure disorder, and ulcerative colitis. Medications included carbamazepine, ergo- calciferol, fluticasone, gabapentin, mesalamine, methocarbamol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxycodone\u2013acetamino- phen, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topira- mate, and zinc sulfate. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was receiving disabil- ity benefits and did not work because of chronic back pain. She had smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 35 years. She did not drink alcohol  or use illicit drugs. Her mother had endometrial cancer, and her father had lung cancer.\nOn  examination,  the  temporal  temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/52 mm Hg, the pulse 132 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 96% while the patient was breathing am- bient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.9. Her weight had decreased by 6 kg since the admission 1 month earlier. She appeared chronically ill and was lethargic but arose in response to voice. She moved her arms and legs but did not participate in a detailed neu- rologic examination. Pitting edema was present in the arms and legs. The white-cell count was 17,150 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with neutrophil predominance. The blood zinc level was 0.35 \u03bcg per milliliter, the copper  level  0.28  \u03bcg  per milliliter (reference range, 0.75 to 1.45), and the vitamin B6 level less than 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50). Urinalysis revealed trace ketones and 50 to 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value,\n<10). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nA chest radiograph was normal, without evi- dence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Urine, blood, and stool specimens were obtained for culture. Three liters of intravenous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution were administered, and the systolic blood pressure increased to 100 mm Hg. Three hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, she became more lethar- gic and had no response to voice; she reacted to being shaken but did not open her eyes or an- swer questions. Additional imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Theodore T. Pierce: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the admin- istration of contrast material, showed no abnor- malities. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis, as well as mucosal hyperen- hancement and submucosal edema involving por- tions of the small and large bowel, with relative sparing of the distal jejunum, proximal ileum, descending colon, and sigmoid colon.\nDr. Bobkowski: Treatment with intravenous van-\ncomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was initi- ated. Six hours after the patient\u2019s arrival in the emergency department, the blood pressure de- creased to 85/45 mm Hg, and the heart rate increased to 132 beats per minute. There was no response to painful stimuli. Myoclonic jerk- ing movements were observed. Treatment with norepinephrine was initiated, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. The trachea was intubated for airway protection, and sedation with propofol and dexmedetomidine was initiated. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was continued; prescribed medications of carbamazepine, a multivitamin, omeprazole, selenium, sucralfate, thiamine, topiramate, and zinc sulfate were administered. On the first hospital day, the blood pressure increased, and vasopressors and sedative medi- cations were discontinued. The patient had no spontaneous interaction or speech production. She did not follow commands or grimace in re- sponse to noxious stimuli. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The corneal reflexes were intact, as were the cough and gag reflexes. There was no spontaneous movement of the arms or legs, but they withdrew in response to pain; the deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The results of CT of the head were normal. Sedation was not resumed, and serial neurologic examinations were performed.\nOn the second hospital day, leukocytosis had resolved, but the patient\u2019s mental status had not improved. Electroencephalography (EEG) with long-term monitoring revealed near-continuous generalized periodic discharges with triphasic morphologic features, often with superimposed rhythmic activity. The results of magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) of the head were normal,    as were the results of magnetic resonance angi- ography of the head and neck. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed normal protein levels and no nucleated cells. The urine culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae.  The  blood  and  stool  cultures  were negative, as was a stool test for Clostridioides dif- ficile and an examination of the stool for ova and parasites. Treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole was stopped, and treatment with ciprofloxacin was started.\nOn the third hospital day, the patient\u2019s men- tal status had not improved. EGD showed a small scar at the gastrojejunal anastomosis but otherwise normal mucosa. The results of flexible sigmoidoscopy were normal. Biopsy specimens of the jejunum and descending colon showed normal mucosa.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Amulya Nagarur: This 50-year-old woman with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, ulcerative colitis, bipolar disorder, and seizure disorder initially presented with malnutrition and  ana- sarca and then had rapidly progressive encepha- lopathy. A review of the background, midground, and foreground of her presentation will  inform the selection of \u201cillness scripts\u201d to  consider  in  this case.\n\nBackground\nFive months before the current presentation, dysphagia developed, and the patient began to lose weight. Biopsy specimens obtained during EGD showed findings consistent with lympho- cytic esophagitis, a disease entity that is known to cause dysphagia but is not completely under- stood.1 Lymphocytic esophagitis is more com- mon among older people and may be triggered by gastroesophageal reflux disease, which could have developed in this patient after gastric by- pass surgery.\nAn attempt at treatment with swallowed flutic- asone did not increase the patient\u2019s oral intake. The fact that weight loss occurred despite pro- gressive leg edema is suggestive of muscle loss. Two months before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to the hospital be- cause of anasarca. It was hypothesized that poor oral intake from lymphocytic esophagitis had led to protein-calorie malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia.\nA salient feature of this case is hypoalbumin- emia, which can result from either a decrease in protein production or an abnormal loss of pro- tein.2,3 The average adult liver synthesizes ap- proximately 15 g of albumin per day; the serum half-life of albumin is approximately 20 days. Synthetic dysfunction in the liver can lead to hypoalbuminemia. However, this patient had no other biochemical evidence suggestive of liver synthetic dysfunction. Congenital analbumin- emia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in the gene that encodes albumin, but it is exceedingly rare. Nephrotic syndrome can cause an abnormal loss of albumin, but this possibility was ruled out with urine testing per- formed during the first hospital admission. Profound inflammation can lead to increased vascular permeability and extravasation of albu- min from the intravascular space to the extra- vascular space; such inflammation was not ob- served in this patient. Protein-losing enteropathy remained a possible diagnosis at that time.\nMidground\nOne month before the current presentation, more clues emerged. The patient was found to have additional nutrient deficiencies and reported loose stools. Further investigations for protein- losing enteropathy, including EGD and magnetic resonance enterography, were unrevealing. At this point, protein-losing enteropathy seemed unlikely, and hypoalbuminemia was attributed to poor oral intake. It is important to recognize that the liver can increase production of albumin to compensate for a deficiency, which suggests that another process, in addition to poor oral intake, may have been contributing to hypoalbu- minemia.\n\nForeground\nOne week before the current admission, the pa- tient had rapidly progressive encephalopathy and an unsteady gait that resulted in a fall. A UTI with K. pneumoniae was diagnosed. Hypotension abated after the administration of vasopressors and systemic antibiotic agents, but altered men- tal status persisted.\n\nAltered Mental Status\nThe differential diagnosis for altered mental status in this patient is broad. One helpful diag- nostic schema categorizes infectious and non- infectious diseases according to intracranial or extracranial involvement.\nIntracranial infections \u2014 such as encephali- tis, neurosyphilis, and acquired prion disease\n\u2014 are unlikely in this patient, given that she had normal results on CSF analysis. A UTI was diag- nosed, but altered mental status worsened de- spite treatment with antibiotics. Other extracra- nial infections were ruled out with blood and stool cultures and additional stool studies; ab- dominal imaging showed no signs of intraab- dominal infection.\nNoninfectious intracranial processes, such as hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, were ruled out with CT and MRI. This patient had an underly- ing seizure disorder, but EEG findings were consistent with a toxic\u2013metabolic process, rather than seizure activity. Autoimmune or paraneo- plastic encephalitis, vasculitis, and sporadic prion disease are all unlikely, given the normal results on CSF analysis. Rapidly progressive dementia remains a possible diagnosis. However, this pa- tient had several risk factors that make a nonin-\n \nfectious extracranial cause of altered mental status more likely.4\nThis patient was taking several medications that can cause altered mental status, including carbamazepine, gabapentin, methocarbamol, olan- zapine, oxycodone\u2013acetaminophen, and topira- mate.5 However, none of these medications were newly prescribed. Although changes in her weight could have resulted in altered medication phar- macokinetics, the clinical presentation is not consistent with a class-specific toxidrome, and the altered mental status did not abate with time.\nCould myxedema coma explain the altered mental status in this patient with progressive edema? She had pitting edema, whereas nonpit- ting edema would be expected in a patient with myxedema. In addition, there was no evidence of hypothermia, bradycardia, hypoventilation, hypo- natremia, or hypoglycemia, features that would support a diagnosis of myxedema.6\nIn this patient with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and ulcerative colitis with recent malnutrition and hypoalbuminemia, nutritional deficiencies and metabolic encephalopathy are important noninfectious extracranial causes of altered mental status to consider.\n\nNutritional Deficiencies\nNutritional deficiencies associated with ulcer- ative colitis include deficiencies in iron, vitamin B12, fat-soluble vitamins, and zinc. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause altered mental status.7 However, this patient\u2019s ulcerative colitis did not appear to be active on magnetic resonance en- terography, and the vitamin B12 level was nor- mal. Patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may have macronutrient and mi- cronutrient deficiencies that are related to poor oral intake and alterations in critical absorptive surfaces.8 This patient had several deficiencies associated with previous Roux-en-Y gastric by- pass, including deficiencies in vitamin C, vita- min B6, vitamin A, and trace minerals (zinc, copper, and selenium). However, the most com- mon nutritional deficiencies that cause altered mental status after Roux-en-Y  gastric  bypass are deficiencies in vitamins B1 and  B3,  and  these levels were normal in this patient. Al- though malnutrition is probably playing a role  in this patient\u2019s presentation, the clinical pic- ture does not fit a single nutrient deficiency syndrome.\nHyperammonemia\nAll tissues produce ammonia as a byproduct of amino acid metabolism. The primary route of ammonia excretion is through the urea cycle, with urinary excretion of ammonia as urea. Hy- perammonemic encephalopathy can occur when perturbations in ammonia metabolism lead to  an elevated ammonia level.9 Although an elevat- ed ammonia level can be suggestive of this diag- nosis in the presence of appropriate risk factors and clinical findings, testing for ammonia can notoriously yield falsely elevated results.10,11\nHepatic encephalopathy is a clinical syndrome that can be encountered in patients with cirrho- sis when portosystemic shunting causes ammo- nia to bypass the hepatic metabolism. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy can present with various manifestations of altered mental status and associated findings, such as asterixis. This patient had progressive altered mental status  and myoclonic jerking but no history of cirrho- sis. In addition, she had no findings on physi- cal examination or laboratory test results that were suggestive of cirrhosis. However, she had several risk factors for noncirrhotic hyperam- monemia.\n\nNoncirrhotic Hyperammonemia\nThere were no signs suggesting that this patient had hyperammonemia due to acute liver failure. Hyperammonemia can be caused by an in- creased protein load from an oral or parenteral source or from gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient had increased her protein intake substantially 1 week before the onset of altered mental status. Hyperammonemia can also be caused by a catabolic state, such as severe mal- nutrition.12 The patient\u2019s weight loss despite the development of progressive edema was sugges- tive of muscle loss and sarcopenia. Muscle is an important extrahepatic site of ammonia metabo- lism, and severe sarcopenia can lead to hyper- ammonemia.13\nCertain drugs and toxins, including antiepi- leptic agents such as valproate, can cause urea- cycle dysfunction and hyperammonemia. There are case reports of carbamazepine-induced asterixis with hyperammonemia, but it is exceed- ingly rare.14,15 Hyperammonemia can also be due to   infections   with   urease-producing bacteria, including  K. pneumoniae.  Inherited  and  acquired urea-cycle disorders are considerations in this patient, but her history of Roux-en-Y gastric by- pass suggests the possibility of another clinical syndrome.\n\nHyperammonemia after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass\nThere is an increasingly recognized association between noncirrhotic hyperammonemia and a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and some experts have proposed naming this phenome- non the \u201cgastric bypass hyperammonemia syn- drome.\u201d16 Case reports describe patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy who are typi- cally middle-aged and female and do not have clinically significant liver disease. Hyperammo- nemic encephalopathy may develop at various points after gastric bypass surgery, with hall- mark findings including hypoalbuminemia, nu- tritional deficiencies, an elevated plasma gluta- mine level, and a low zinc level. Delays in diagnosis and management may result in a poor prognosis with a high risk of death.16-18\nHyperammonemia associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is more common in women than in men. It has been hypothesized that undiag- nosed hemizygous pathogenic variants in the gene that encodes ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) in women could contribute to an elevated risk of urea-cycle dysfunction. A role for zinc deficiency in urea-cycle enzymatic dysfunction has also been hypothesized. Increased produc- tion of ammonia, portosystemic shunting, an altered intestinal microbiome, and a profound catabolic state after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass may all contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome, although more investigation is need- ed to understand this rare and unique dis- ease.17,19\nI suspect that this patient had noncirrhotic hyperammonemia after Roux-en-Y gastric by- pass and that the diagnostic test was measure- ment of the serum ammonia level. The degree to which certain aspects of her presentation \u2014 in- cluding the high-protein diet, sarcopenia, meta- bolic effects of carbamazepine, and UTI with\nK. pneumoniae \u2014 contributed to her rapid decline\nis unclear. These are important considerations.\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Nina B. Gold: The diagnostic test was measure- ment of the serum ammonia level. The serum specimen must be obtained from a free-flowing venipuncture without the use of a tourniquet, stored on ice, and sent immediately to the labo- ratory; deviations from this process may lead to falsely elevated results. This patient\u2019s serum ammonia level was 90 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 12 to 48) and remained elevated on repeat measurements, with a maximum level of 107 \u03bcmol per liter. She had encephalopathy during the time that these levels were obtained. The next step was an evaluation for causes of noncir- rhotic hyperammonemia, including inherited metabolic disorders and acquired perturbations of the urea cycle.\nThe plasma amino acid levels obtained during the patient\u2019s hospitalization were low, a finding consistent with malnutrition. The free and total plasma carnitine levels, plasma acylcarnitine profile, serum creatine kinase level, and urine organic acid levels obtained after the hospital- ization were normal. She was found to have a mildly elevated urine orotic acid level, which can be associated with proximal urea-cycle dysfunc- tion. However, repeat measurements of  the plasma amino acid levels have not shown hall- marks of a proximal urea-cycle defect, such as an elevated glutamine level or a low citrulline level (Fig. 2). Results of molecular testing for 76 monogenic disorders associated with hyperam- monemia were normal, which makes a diagnosis of an inherited metabolic disorder, such as an ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, unlikely. The most likely reason for noncirrhotic hy- perammonemia in this patient is her history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Malnutrition, followed by the rapid initiation of a high-protein diet, might have led to acquired dysfunction of the urea cycle that resulted in noncirrhotic hyperam-\nmonemia.\n",
