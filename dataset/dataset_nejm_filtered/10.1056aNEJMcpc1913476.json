    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Emily W. Lopes: An 89-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of recurrent bloody stools.\nTwo years before the current evaluation, the patient underwent repair of a right inguinal hernia. After he recovered from that procedure, he had intermittent pain in the right lower quadrant. Four months before the current evaluation, he was admitted to this hospital for diffuse abdominal pain followed by presyncope dur- ing an attempt to defecate. Examination was notable for bilateral lower abdominal tenderness  and  a  crescendo\u2013decrescendo  systolic  murmur  (grade  2/6)  at  the  left sternal border. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Lauren A. Roller: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1A and 1B), performed after the administration of oral but not intravenous contrast material, showed diverticulosis of the descending and sigmoid colon, with focal areas of hyperemia and wall thickening in the distal descending colon. There were atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and aortic branches, with a 36-mm infra- renal aortic aneurysm. Small radiopaque stones were present in the gallbladder and common bile duct.\nDr. Lopes: Several bowel movements with loose, nonbloody stools occurred, with a decrease in abdominal pain. Empirical oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were prescribed, and the patient was discharged on the third hospital day.\nTwo months later, the patient was readmitted to this hospital with a 3-week history of progressively bloody stools and crampy, diffuse abdominal pain, which had awakened him from sleep. The pain was worst before bowel movements, which occurred approximately five times per day. Increasing amounts of red blood were present in the stools. The patient reported no fever, anorexia, nausea, or vomiting. Examination revealed abdominal tenderness, primarily in the lower quadrants, and the presence of soft, red-brown, formed stool in the rectal vault that was guaiac-positive. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Two units of packed red cells were transfused. Aspirin was discontinued, and a stool specimen was submit- ted for microbiologic evaluation.\nDr. Roller: CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1C), performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, showed a long segment of circumferential wall thickening in the rectum and sigmoid colon and diverticu- losis of the distal descending colon, without di- verticulitis.\nDr. Lopes: Empirical treatment with oral cipro- floxacin and metronidazole was started. On the second hospital day, nucleic-acid testing of stool was positive for Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) toxin; ciprofloxacin was dis- continued. Three days later, abdominal discom- fort persisted, and there were four or five bowel movements per day with blood and intermittent mucus in the stools. Oral vancomycin therapy was started, and metronidazole was discontin- ued. During the next 3 days, the frequency of bowel movements decreased to two per day, and the patient was discharged to complete 2 weeks of oral vancomycin therapy.\nTwo weeks after discharge, the frequency of bowel movements increased to four to six per day, with increasingly bloody stools but without abdominal pain. The dose of vancomycin was increased. During the next week, the frequency of bowel movements with bloody stools in- creased to eight per day, with intermittent incon- tinence of stool. The patient was admitted for the third time to this hospital. On examination, there was mild bilateral lower abdominal tender- ness. The stool was guaiac-positive, and testing for C. difficile toxin was negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the stool showed normal enteric flora and no patho- genic bacteria.\nOn the fifth day, f lexible sigmoidoscopy (Fig. 2A and 2B) revealed diffusely hemorrhagic, erythematous, congested, eroded, friable mucosa in the sigmoid colon, with spontaneous bleeding and pseudopolyps. Biopsy specimens were ob- tained.\nDr. Lawrence R. Zukerberg: The next day, patho- logical analysis of the biopsy specimens revealed evidence of markedly active chronic colitis, in- cluding surface erosion, neutrophilic cryptitis, crypt loss, and replacement of the lamina pro- pria with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Fig. 2C). Scattered cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclu- sion bodies were detected on immunostaining (Fig. 2D).\nDr. Lopes: Ganciclovir therapy was started, and laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Over the next 4 days, there was no decrease in the number of daily bowel movements, but the num- ber of bloody stools decreased. Intermittent anorexia and crampy lower abdominal pain oc- curred. Ganciclovir was switched to valganci- clovir. Over the next 6 days, the frequency of bowel movements decreased to two to five per day, with a modest decrease in anorexia and abdominal pain. The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility.\nTwo weeks later, the patient had persistently loose, yellow, foul-smelling stools. One week later, bloody stools recurred, and after a marked increase in bloody stools over the following week, the patient was readmitted to this hospi- tal. He reported reduced appetite, an uninten- tional loss of 3 kg during the past month, ten- derness on the left side of the abdomen, and diffuse weakness. A review of systems was negative for fever, other bleeding and bruising,and genitourinary, cardiopulmonary, musculo- skeletal, and dermatologic symptoms. There were no specific sick contacts at the rehabilitation facility or residents with reported gastrointesti- nal illnesses.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for coronary artery disease, moderate aortic steno- sis, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal insufficiency, glaucoma, and a thyroid nodule; he had undergone aortocoronary- bypass grafting. Outpatient medications includ- ed valganciclovir, simvastatin, cholecalciferol, mirtazapine, a multivitamin, and latanoprost eyedrops, as well as loperamide and diphenoxy- late with atropine as needed. There were no ad- verse reactions to medications.\nThe patient had retired from military service.\nHe had no recent history of travel. He had last used tobacco three decades earlier, and he did not drink alcohol or use illicit substances. His mother had had coronary artery disease and his father had had a stroke; there was no family his- tory of infectious or autoimmune disease.\nThe temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 89 beats per minute, the blood pressure 117/58 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was a frail-appearing elderly man with dry mucous membranes and impaired dentition but no oropharyngeal lesions. Cardiac auscultation revealed a crescendo\u2013decrescendo murmur (grade 2/6) at the left sternal border. An abdominal examina- tion revealed tenderness on palpation of the right lower quadrant, without distention, rebound guarding, or organomegaly. A rectal examina- tion revealed only a few small external hemor- rhoids, no palpable fissures or masses, slightly reduced rectal tone, and guaiac-positive, light- red, loose stool with mucus. Peripheral pulses were intact, and there were no rashes. The re- mainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes, lactate, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and troponin T and the results of liver-function tests were normal; other test results are shown in Table 1. Stool testing for\nC. difficile toxin and Shiga toxin was negative, as was examination of the stool for ova and para- sites; a test for Entamoeba histolytica antibodies was also negative. A stool specimen was obtained for culture.\nDr. Roller: CT of the abdomen (Fig. 3A and 3B), performed after the administration of intrave- nous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse bowel-wall thickening and inflammatory changes involving the rectum and the entire colon. There was again evidence of calcific atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta and aortic branches, with a 37-mm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with mural thrombus.\nDr. Lopes: Treatment with oral vancomycin and intravenous ganciclovir was started. The patient had bowel movements with bloody stools every 2 to 3 hours. On the second hospital day, flexible sigmoidoscopy (Fig. 3C and 3D) revealed diffuse severe colonic inflammation, erythema, edema, friability, and deep ulcerations in the sigmoid colon and rectum.\nDr. Zukerberg: Pathological examination of bi- opsy specimens of the rectum and sigmoid colon (Fig. 3E and 3F) revealed evidence of severely active chronic colitis, including surface ulcer- ation, replacement of the lamina propria with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and rare cholesterol emboli in small vessels. Immunohis- tochemical stains for CMV, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and adenovirus were negative, as was a shell-vial culture for CMV.\n\nTable 1.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimens (Panel C) shows evidence of active chronic colitis, including replace\u00ad ment of the lamina propria with lymphocytes and plasma cells (single arrow) and surface erosion (double arrow). Immunostaining (Panel D) shows cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies (in brown; arrows), a finding indicative of cyto\u00ad megalovirus infection.\n\nFigure 3. CT Scan, Endoscopic Images, and Biopsy Specimens from the Current Admission.\nAxial and coronal CT images (Panels A and B, respectively), obtained after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, show contiguous wall thickening and mucosal enhancement and edema (arrows) involving the entire colon; the rectum was also involved. Also shown is mural thrombus in an abdominal aortic aneurysm (Panel A, arrowhead). Images obtained during flexible sigmoidoscopy (Panels C and D) show diffuse severe colonic inflammation, erythema, edema, friability, and deep ulcerations (Panel C, arrow) in the rectum and sigmoid colon. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the biopsy specimens (Panels E and F) shows severely active chronic colitis char\u00ad acterized by replacement of the lamina propria with lymphocytes and plasma cells (Panel E), as well as a cleft\u00adshaped embolus in a small vessel (Panel F, arrow).\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Hacho B. Bohossian: This 89-year-old man with coronary artery disease presented with a several- month history of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. The bloody stools, abdominal pain, weight loss, and rising erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level suggest that the pa- tient had chronic inflammatory diarrhea. The differential diagnosis includes infection, cancer, vascular causes, and noninfectious inflamma- tory causes.\n\nInfection\nInfectious colitis due to a bacterial pathogen, which is normally a major consideration in a patient with acute bloody diarrhea, is unlikely to account for the months of symptoms seen in this case. Could recurrence of C. difficile infec- tion, which had been diagnosed during this pa- tient\u2019s second admission, explain his entire clini- cal course? Pseudomembranes are not classically seen in patients with recurrent C. difficile disease or inflammatory bowel disease,1 so the absence of pseudomembranes on endoscopic examina- tion does not rule out recurrent infection. How- ever, the clinically significant amount of bleed- ing, the deep colonic ulcerations on endoscopy, and the absence of fever and leukocytosis are highly unusual for ongoing C. difficile infection.\nThere are several parasitic infections to consider in this case, including E. histolytica and Strongyloides stercoralis infections. Intestinal ame- biasis is subacute, with bloody diarrhea lasting weeks to months, and is associated with imag- ing and endoscopic findings that mimic ulcer- ative colitis, specifically diffuse inflammation, friable mucosa, and ulcerations.2  S. stercoralis colitis is another parasitic infection that can re- semble ulcerative colitis,3 and it could account for the mild eosinophilia identified at the time of this patient\u2019s second hospital admission. Eosinophilia is commonly seen in chronic stron- gyloidiasis but not in active disease. In addition, bandemia, which was noted during this patient\u2019s third and current hospital admissions, can de- velop when multiplication of colonic larvae dur- ing the autoinfection stage results in microper- forations of the bowel.\nHowever, the patient had not been in areas where parasites are endemic. In addition, three features make parasitic colitis an unlikely diag- nosis in this case: the negative laboratory tests, particularly the negative serologic test for E. histo- lytica; the proximal progression of colitis from the rectum and sigmoid colon, since parasitic entities affect the ascending colon most often and attenuate distally; and the contiguous in- flammation seen on endoscopic evaluation, since skipped and spared areas are typically seen with amebiasis and strongyloidiasis.3,4\nCancer\nGastrointestinal cancer should be considered in patients with chronic lower gastrointestinal blood loss. In this patient, the features of the clinical presentation and the endoscopic findings make colorectal carcinoma and colonic lymphoma un- likely. However, plasma-cell dyscrasia and gas- trointestinal amyloidosis can lead to chronic bloody diarrhea.5 The abnormal levels of free light chains suggest the possibility of amyloido- sis, but this finding by itself is inconclusive and could be explained by the patient\u2019s chronic kid- ney disease or an alternative inflammatory pro- cess. In addition, this patient did not have any of the findings associated with amyloidosis, such as heart failure, neuropathy, or proteinuria, nor did he have any histologic findings to support a di- agnosis of gastrointestinal amyloidosis.\n\nColonic Ischemia\nCould this patient\u2019s abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea be due to ischemia? Colonic ischemia is manifested by acute, self-limited bloody diarrhea and is thus unlikely in this case. Given the find- ings on examination of the biopsy specimens of the rectum and sigmoid colon, cholesterol crys- tal embolization should also be considered. This CMV colitis? The severe colitis with friable mu- cosa and deep ulcerations on endoscopy, coupled with the architectural disarray and plasma-cell deposits on histologic examination, are com- monly seen in ulcerative colitis. Could this pa- tient have had underlying ulcerative colitis all along?\n\nUlcerative Colitis\nC. difficile infection is the infection that is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease,9 and it frequently exacerbates the sever- ity of the disease.10 This patient received cipro- floxacin, an antibiotic agent associated with the development of C. difficile infection. In addition, there is ample evidence of an association be- tween CMV colitis and ulcerative colitis. CMV is frequently found in tissue specimens from pa- tients with inflammatory bowel disease11; whether the detection of CMV signifies the pres- ence of CMV reactivation colitis is a matter of debate.12 CMV reactivation colitis is common among patients with ulcerative colitis who are treated with glucocorticoids.13 CMV colitis is known to complicate the course of inflamma- tory bowel disease,14 and testing for CMV is recommended in patients with worsening ulcer- ative colitis, presumably because of the affinity of CMV for inflamed mucosal surfaces.15 Al- though the question of whether CMV is involved in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis11,14 or is an \u201cinnocent bystander\u201d16,17 has not been defini- tively answered, this patient\u2019s initial biopsy re- sults showing evidence of CMV colitis are con- sistent with the presence of underlying ulcerative colitis. Finally, it has been suggested that C. dif- ficile infection and CMV colitis may occur to- gether in immunocompetent patients, frequently with adverse outcomes.18\nUlcerative colitis could account for  many other aspects of the patient\u2019s presentation. It is frequently associated with eosinophilia early in the disease course and with bandemia as the disease progresses, presumably because of un- controlled chronic colonic inflammation and possible bacterial translocation. Ulcerative coli- tis is also associated with abnormal immunoglo- bin levels; although it has traditionally been linked to elevated immunoglobin levels, more recent studies have shown that it may be linked to low immunoglobulin levels, especially low patient had a history of vascular disease and a known abdominal aortic aneurysm, and although his aortic mural thrombus was probably chronic and of little clinical relevance, showering of the colonic circulation with cholesterol emboli from an aortic plaque is possible. Patients with cho- lesterol embolization most commonly present with abdominal pain and bleeding,6 with eosino- philia classically developing during the early stages.7 However, the absence of involvement of any other organ system, such as the skin or kid- neys, is unusual.\nFurthermore, the fact that this patient had\npredominant rectal involvement is not consistent with a vascular insult. The rectum receives its blood supply from three distinct sources: the superior rectal artery, which is a continuation of the inferior mesenteric artery, the sole blood supply to the descending colon; the middle rec- tal artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery; and the inferior rectal artery, which is a branch of the internal pudendal artery. There- fore, the rectum is classically spared in a colonic ischemic event.\n\nInflammation\nAn inflammatory process is the most likely ex- planation for this patient\u2019s illness. His history of diverticulosis suggests the possibility of seg- mental colitis associated with diverticulosis, which could account for many of the features seen in this case, including the persistent bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, relatively normal lab- oratory test results, and erythematous, friable mucosa seen on endoscopic examination. Seg- mental colitis associated with diverticulosis in- volves only segments of inflamed colon that are close to the diverticula, with areas of healthy mu- cosa interspersed between the inflamed areas.8 The colonic inflammation seen in this patient was contiguous. It was also not confined to sec- tions in which diverticula were present, such as the rectum and sigmoid colon; instead, by the time of the last admission, it spanned the entire colon. Finally, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis spares the rectum, which is an- other reason that it cannot account for all the clinical features of this patient\u2019s presentation.\nCould  another  inflammatory condition ac-\ncount for the patient\u2019s symptoms and explain his earlier diagnoses of both C. difficile colitis and IgM levels in older patients.19 The connection between ulcerative colitis and an increased risk of thromboembolism is well described20; al- though the usual concern is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, patients with ulcer- ative colitis also have an increased rate of arte- rial thrombosis, which could explain in part the aortic mural thrombus and the cholesterol em- bolization seen in this case.\nIn summary, the chronic bloody diarrhea, the development of C. difficile colitis after treatment with ciprofloxacin, the subsequent admission for CMV colitis, and the continued clinical deterio- ration with worsening systemic symptoms, ris- ing inflammatory markers, and new bandemia, coupled with the endoscopic and histologic find- ings, make ulcerative colitis the most likely diag- nosis in this case.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Zukerberg: Histologic examination of the third set of biopsy specimens showed evidence of markedly active chronic colitis. There was ex- pansion of the lamina propria by lymphocytes and plasma cells, along with crypt loss and patchy surface erosion and ulceration. Neutro- philic inflammation was present in the crypts (indicating neutrophilic cryptitis) and in the sur- face epithelium and lamina propria. Prominent crypt abscesses were present (Fig. 4C). The dif- ferential diagnosis included inflammatory bowel disease, infection, and segmental colitis associ- ated with diverticulosis. Infectious colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcer- ative colitis, can be similar in histologic appear- ance. However, the prominent crypt abscesses and dense chronic inflammation favor a diagno- sis of ulcerative colitis. Segmental colitis associ- ated with diverticulosis may be similar in histo- logic appearance to ulcerative colitis, and there may be a relationship between the two entities in some cases. However, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis is usually not as severe and is limited to areas of diverticular disease; in light of these factors, ulcerative colitis is again the favored diagnosis in this case.\nThe previous colonic insults \u2014 including documented C. difficile colitis, CMV infection, diverticulosis, and probable ischemia \u2014 may have played a role in the development of symp- tomatic ulcerative colitis.21,22 Alteration of the f lora in association with mucosal injury and antigen exposure may have thereby altered the colonic immune response and stimulated a new or smoldering autoimmune reaction.\n",
