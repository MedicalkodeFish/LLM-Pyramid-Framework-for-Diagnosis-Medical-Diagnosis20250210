    "Primary Symptom": "A 55-Year-Old Man\nwith Bilateral Hearing Loss and Eye Redness\n",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Mia Y. Bothwell (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatol- ogy clinic of this hospital because of bilateral hearing loss and eye redness.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the cur- rent evaluation, when a headache involving the left temple developed. A similar headache had occurred during an episode of shingles 15 years earlier. He received a prescription for a 1-week course of valacyclovir for the treatment of presumed shingles. No skin lesions developed, and the headache resolved.\nFour weeks before the current evaluation, hearing loss in the left ear developed during an airplane flight. The hearing loss persisted after the flight, and the pa- tient began to have intermittent tinnitus in the left ear and redness in both eyes. He was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at a clinic affiliated with this hospital. He reported no vertigo, otorrhea, rhinitis, or sore throat. On examination, there was redness in both eyes. The right and left auricles and external auditory canals were normal, as was the right tympanic membrane. The left tympanic membrane was retracted; there was no middle-ear effusion. Results of the Weber test were inconsistent. The Rinne test was positive bilaterally, with air conduction greater than bone conduction. There was no sinus tenderness. Nasopharyngoscopy re- vealed midseptal deviation to the left; the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx was normal. The remainder of the examination, including a cranial nerve examination, was normal.\nAn audiogram showed sloping mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss in both\nears. Results were asymmetric at low frequencies, with more severe hearing loss in the left ear than in the right ear from 125 to 2000 Hz (Fig. 1A). Word recogni- tion was 96% with the right ear and 84% with the left ear (reference range, 80 to 100). Results of tympanometry were normal in both ears. The patient received a prescription for a 12-day tapering course of oral prednisone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormal findings.\nFour weeks later, the patient was evaluated by a different otolaryngologist at the clinic affili- ated with this hospital. Hearing loss had pro- gressed. Eye redness had initially decreased after prednisone therapy was started but had subsequently recurred after prednisone therapy was stopped. On examination, there was red- ness in both eyes. There was no spontaneous nystagmus or gait ataxia. Sinusoidal gaze track- ing was normal. The head-thrust test to the left was positive, a finding that indicates vestibular hypofunction on the left side. Results of the Romberg test were normal. The Fukuda step test was positive, with the patient rotated to the left, a finding that also indicates vestibular hypo- function on the left side. A repeat audiogram showed worsening of sensorineural hearing loss and reduction of word recognition to 90% with the right ear and 64% with the left ear (Fig. 1B). Results of tympanometry were normal. The pa- tient was referred for an urgent rheumatologic evaluation.\nThree days later, in the rheumatology clinic at this hospital, the patient reported ongoing hear- ing loss in both ears and redness in both eyes, as well as the recent onset of imbalance. He also reported that he had had fatigue and intermit- tent body aches for 2 months and that he had lost 5 kg of weight over a 6-month period. There was no history of oral or genital lesions; 6 weeks earlier, a nonpruritic patchy rash had developed on his torso after he received the influenza vac- cine and had rapidly resolved with the use of an oral antihistamine. There was a history of irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, gastritis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. Medications included intranasal and inhaled fluticasone, vitamin B12, and omeprazole. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in an urban area of New England. For the past 12 years, he had been sexually active with his wife only. He was a retired construction worker. He was a nonsmoker, drank alcohol rarely, and did not use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 115/79 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per min- ute, the respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. There was redness in both eyes. The finger-rub test revealed grossly reduced hearing in both ears. The Romberg test was positive when the patient\u2019s eyes were open, a finding that indicates vestibular or cerebellar hypofunction. The remainder of the examina- tion, including skin, joint, and neurologic assess- ments, was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of liver- function and kidney-function tests. The complete blood count with differential count was normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 55 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13), and the C- reactive protein level 12.3 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0). The patient was referred for an ur- gent ophthalmologic evaluation at this hospital, which was to take place on the same day.\nOn ophthalmologic evaluation, the patient reported no blurred vision, floaters, eye pain, itching, or photophobia. He wore contact lenses, which he changed daily. On examination, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. The right cornea had trace pinpoint epithelial deposits, a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial erosions, and several small confluent areas of punctate epithelial ero- sions centrally, with no infiltrate. The left cornea had a peripheral ring of punctate epithelial ero- sions and several confluent areas of punctate epithelial erosions centrally, with no infiltrate. There was evidence of anterior uveitis, with 7 cells per high-power field in the right anterior cham- ber and 6 to 7 cells per high-power field in the left anterior chamber. There was trace flare in both eyes.\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "Lyme disease;Syphilis",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Jeffrey P. Harris: This 55-year-old man presented with progressive hearing loss, imbalance, and ocular inflammation. A headache involving the left temple had occurred 8 weeks earlier. These symptoms were superimposed on a 6-month his- tory of weight loss, a 2-month history of body aches and fatigue, and the occurrence of a non- pruritic rash on the torso (Fig. 2). During the evaluation, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level were elevated. On the basis of this constellation of findings, I will focus my initial differential diagnosis on the conditions that cause temporal pain, asymmet- ric sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular in- flammation.\n\nTemporal Pain\nThe development of clinically significant tempo- ral pain prompts consideration of temporal arte- ritis, a specific phenotype of giant-cell arteritis.Although hearing loss and elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are consistent with this condition, the patient is young for the development of tem- poral arteritis; the mean age at onset is 72  years.1,2 In addition, there was no jaw claudica- tion or vision loss, and the lack of a response to glucocorticoids and the normal retinal examina- tion make this possibility unlikely.3\nThe history of shingles suggests the possibil- ity of a recurrence of herpes zoster oticus. How- ever, there were no vesicles on the auricle or posterior auditory canal; the eye redness, with- out vesicles, crossed the midline to affect both eyes; and the rash on the torso was not in a dermatomal distribution. Audiovestibular symp- toms can be a manifestation of herpes zoster oticus, but this patient did not have facial nerve paresis, which often occurs. In addition, herpes zoster oticus does not affect both labyrinths.\n\nAsymmetric Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Dizziness\nUpper respiratory infection can lead to the acute onset of progressive hearing loss, known as sud- den sensorineural hearing loss. However, the hearing loss would not involve both ears. A posterior fossa mass, such as a vestibular schwannoma, can cause both asymmetric senso- rineural hearing loss and dizziness, and such tumors can occur bilaterally in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. Leptomeningeal infil- tration from lymphocytic leukemia, carcinoma- tosis, or neurosarcoidosis can also cause asym- metric sensorineural hearing loss.4,5 However, the results of MRI in this patient rule out these possibilities. Meniere\u2019s disease involves both ears in 10 to 47% of cases.6 However, this condition is not associated with ocular inflammation or systemic symptoms. Autoimmune inner ear dis- ease is characterized by rapidly progressive asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, and af- fected patients may have vestibular abnormali- ties. Autoimmune inner ear disease may occur in isolation or as part of a spectrum of rheumato- logic conditions, but it would not explain this patient\u2019s ocular symptoms.7\nInner Ear and Ocular Involvement\nThe patient had a positive Fukuda step test and a positive head-thrust test to the left; subse- quently, a Romberg test was also positive. These findings suggest a vestibulopathy on the left side or a posterior-column disorder with altered pro- prioception. He had bilateral ocular inflamma- tion, a finding consistent with keratitis and an- terior uveitis, but he did not have loss of visual acuity, eye pain, or evidence of involvement of the posterior chamber or retinal artery. Condi- tions associated with both inner ear and ocular involvement and with systemic symptoms fall under three main categories: systemic vasculi- tides and rheumatologic diseases, autoinflamma- tory conditions, and infections.\n\nSystemic Vasculitides and Rheumatologic Diseases Inner ear and ocular involvement can be mani- festations of several important systemic vasculi- tides and rheumatologic diseases.\n \nSystemic lupus erythematosus can cause episcleritis and uveitis, but it typically affects the retinal vasculature, and such involvement was not observed in this patient. In addition, patients with lupus typically have high-frequency hearing loss, whereas this patient had low-frequency hearing loss.8\nPatients with relapsing polychondritis can have both ocular inflammation and inner ear dysfunction. However, this patient did not have any joint involvement or inflammation of carti- lage in the nose, auricle, trachea, or bronchus, features that would suggest a diagnosis of re- lapsing polychondritis.\nAnkylosing spondylitis can cause hearing loss, but the hearing loss is usually mild and conduc- tive in nature. In addition, patients with anky- losing spondylitis usually have uveitis in one eye at a time.9\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis is a disor- der that causes tissue necrosis and vasculitis involving small and medium-sized vessels. Al- though the middle ear and nearly every structure in the eye can be involved, this patient did not have any lesions in the lungs, kidneys, or sinuses, features that would suggest a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\nCogan\u2019s syndrome causes hearing loss, dizzi- ness, and bilateral eye findings that were origi- nally referred to as \u201cnonsyphilitic keratitis.\u201d The eye findings include bilateral ocular inflamma- tion, photophobia, and eye pain and may involve interstitial keratitis, episcleritis, scleritis, and uveitis. The onset of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo is typically sudden and occurs within 3 to 4 months after the eye findings develop.10 Tem- poral bone studies have shown osteoneogenesis of the cochlea.11 Constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, myalgias, and ar- thralgias occur within 2 months after the onset of the illness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are elevated.10,12,13 Cogan\u2019s syndrome may have cardiovascular manifestations, such as aortitis. The incidence is increased in persons with HLA-B17, HLA-A9, HLA-Bw35, and HLA-Cw4. Anti-HSP70 antibod- ies have been reported to be present in 92.5% of patients with Cogan\u2019s syndrome and have also been found in patients with autoimmune inner ear disease and rapidly progressive sen- sorineural hearing loss.14,15 This patient had most of the signs and symptoms of Cogan\u2019s syndrome, so it remains a top consideration in this case.\n\nAutoinflammatory Conditions\nSeveral autoinflammatory disorders may have inner ear and ocular involvement.\nSusac\u2019s syndrome causes both ocular inflam- mation and sensorineural hearing loss. However, the condition is characterized by encephalopathy and retinal-artery occlusion, which were absent in this patient.\nPatients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s syndrome can present with anterior and posterior uveitis, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, this patient did not have skin, oral, or genital ulcerations, which are hall- marks of this condition.\nParaneoplastic syndromes, which are due to an altered immune response to an underlying cancer, can also cause inner ear and eye defi- cits.16 These syndromes occur in 8% of pa- tients with cancer and are most frequently associated with lung, breast, hematologic, medul- lary thyroid, gynecologic, and prostate cancers. This patient did not have a known underlying cancer.\n\nInfections\nSeveral well-recognized infections can cause si- multaneous inner ear and ocular involvement and must be considered.\nTuberculosis can be associated with numerous eye symptoms, ranging from lid to retinal symp- toms. It can also involve the middle ear and mastoid sinus by passing through the eusta- chian tube. Tuberculosis can result in clinically significant destruction, including multiple tym- panic membrane perforations and middle-ear inflammation, which can lead to hearing loss and dizziness. This patient had no evidence of a process involving the middle ear or mastoid.17 In addition, if he were to have tuberculosis involv- ing the central nervous system, I would expect him to be much sicker.\nLyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burg-\ndorferi, is a great masquerader that can mimic many of the diseases discussed. It is endemic in the Northeast region of the United States, where this patient lives, and can cause constitutional symptoms such as myalgias, weight loss, and fatigue. It can also cause sensorineural hearing\n \n\nloss and vertigo, as well as uveitis and episcle- ritis.18 The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level may be elevated. Al- though erythema migrans (the bull\u2019s-eye rash) is characteristic of this infection, the rash does not develop in 20 to 30% of patients, and some pa- tients may not be aware that they have been bitten by a tick. Joint involvement is seen in up to 60% of cases, and neurologic abnormalities such as facial nerve paralysis are reported in 15 to 20% of cases.19 Although this patient\u2019s rash was not consistent with erythema migrans and he did not have any joint swelling, I cannot dis- miss Lyme disease as a possible diagnosis.\nSir William Osler aptly said, \u201cHe who knows syphilis knows medicine.\u201d Although this patient indicated that he had been monogamous for the past 12 years, the preceding history is unknown. His constitutional symptoms of weight loss, myalgias, arthralgias, and headache and the ele- vations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are consistent with syphilis. Neurosyphilis can cause progressive bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo; histopathological studies have shown involve- ment of the temporal bone and its marrow spaces, the incus, and the region of the endo- lymphatic sac, which can lead to endolymphatic hydrops.20,21 Neurosyphilis is also a well-known cause of episcleritis, keratitis, and uveitis. This patient briefly had a nonpruritic rash on his torso, which could be consistent with the sec- ondary stage of syphilis. He had a positive Rom- berg test, which suggests a disease process af- fecting the posterior column with an alteration in proprioception, a classic finding of tabes dorsalis, a complication of late-stage syphilis.\nIn summary, the list of systemic disorders as-\nsociated with eye and ear involvement and with constitutional signs and symptoms is broad.22 However, this patient\u2019s presentation is most con- sistent with Cogan\u2019s syndrome or a spirochetal infection \u2014 either syphilis or Lyme disease. Among these entities, syphilis is the best clinical fit in this case. To establish the diagnosis of syphilis, I would perform a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to look for pleocytosis and to conduct the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test.23\n\n\n\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Syphilis",
    "Diagnosis": "Neurosyphilis",
    "Key testing": "IgM and IgG of T. pallidum in serum",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Elisabeth S. Tabb: Diagnosis of syphilis can be challenging because of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and the lack of a single definitive test.24 Since the pathogen that causes syphilis, Treponema pallidum, is difficult to cul- ture, serologic testing is the most common diag- nostic approach.\nThe first test in our algorithm is a qualitative, automated chemiluminescence microparticle im- munoassay that detects IgM and IgG to T. pallidum in serum, confirming the presence of T. pallidum\u2013 specific antibodies. The test was reactive in this patient. When the first test is positive, we then use the same serum specimen to perform a non- treponemal assay, the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. We perform serial dilutions to determine the end-point antibody titer. The patient\u2019s RPR test was positive at 1:512. Overall, both a trepo- nemal test and a nontreponemal test were posi- tive; these results are interpreted as consistent with current or past syphilis.\nLaboratory testing is helpful in supporting\nthe diagnosis of neurosyphilis. However, no sin- gle test can be used to establish the diagnosis. The diagnosis of neurosyphilis depends on the combination of CSF tests (measurement of the white-cell count and protein level and a reactive VDRL test), a reactive serologic test, and the pres- ence of neurologic signs and symptoms. The CSF FTA-ABS test is a treponemal test that is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF VDRL test but is highly sensitive.25,26 A lumbar punc- ture was performed in this patient. CSF analysis showed colorless nonturbid fluid, with 21 nucleated cells per cubic millimeter, 54% neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes, 24% monocytes, and a total protein level of 83 g per deciliter. The CSF VDRL test was reactive at 1:2; this result supports a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Ocular manifestations that can be associated with neurosyphilis include syphilitic uveitis, which was present in this patient.\n",
