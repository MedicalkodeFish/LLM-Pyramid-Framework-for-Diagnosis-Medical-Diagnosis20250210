    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Priyanka Pullarkat (Medicine): A 33-year-old man was evaluated in the emer- gency department of this hospital because  of  progressively worsening paresthesia. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 weeks before the cur- rent evaluation, when he began to have an abnormal tingling sensation in the toes that he described as \u201cpins and needles.\u201d Over the course of several days, the par-\nesthesia extended to the feet.\nSix weeks before the current presentation, episodes of headache that lasted ap- proximately 5 minutes and affected the left periorbital region began to occur on a daily basis. The headaches became less severe after the patient took acetamino- phen. He had no associated nausea, vomiting, or neck pain.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, paresthesia developed in the finger- tips and, over the course of several days, extended to the hands and then the forearms. One week before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. The temporal temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 134/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.9. He had no rash. Sensation to light touch and pinprick was absent from the toes to the midfoot.\nScreening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C viruses, and Lyme disease were negative. The blood level of folate was greater than 20 ng per milliliter (45 nmol per liter; reference value, >4.6 ng per milliliter [>10  nmol per liter]), the vitamin B1   (thiamine) level 149.1  nmol per liter (reference\nrange, 66.5 to 200), and the vitamin B12  (cobalamin) level 235 pg per milliliter\n(173 pmol per liter; reference range, 232 to 1245 pg per milliliter [171 to 919 pmol per liter]). Testing for anti\u2013myelin-associated glycoprotein antibodies was negative. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Saurabh Rohatgi: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (Fig. 1) was\nperformed. T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed  mild,  nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter; the dominant lesion, which was located in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata, measured 1.4 cm in diameter. No associated abnormal enhancement was seen on images obtained after the administration of contrast material.\nDr. Pullarkat: The patient was referred to a neu-\nrology clinic. One week later, while the patient was awaiting an appointment in the neurology clinic, paresthesia extended into the thighs and torso. The patient was advised by his primary care physician to present to the emergency de- partment of this hospital for further evaluation. In the emergency department, the patient re- ported worsening paresthesia and loss of dexter- ity in his hands. He was no longer able to play guitar. He had no motor weakness, bowel or bladder incontinence, or double vision. There was no change in sensation in his face or in articula- tion of his speech, and he had no dysphonia,\ndysphagia, or shortness of breath.\nOther medical history included depression and chronic knee and ankle pain after trauma. Medications included bupropion and mirtazapine. There were no known allergies. The patient was a graduate student and lived with several room- mates. He was sexually active with women. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 11 years before quitting 4 years before the current presentation. He had consumed three alcoholic drinks daily for many years, but 1 month before the current presentation, he had reduced con- sumption to two drinks one or two times per week. He used intranasal cocaine three or four times per week and inhaled nitrous oxide once per week. He had last used lysergic acid diethyl- amide and ketamine 10 weeks before the current presentation during a camping trip in rural New England; there were ticks in the area where he had camped, but he had not found any ticks on his body. The patient had a normal diet with no dietary restrictions, and there was no history of diarrhea or unintentional weight loss. His ma- ternal grandfather had diabetes, and his pater- nal grandfather had gastric cancer.\nThe  patient was alert and interactive and fol-\nlowed commands. The temporal temperature was 36.5\u00b0C, the blood pressure 131/82 mm Hg, the heart rate 88 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. He had a flat affect but was oriented to time, place, and person. Speech was fluent with intact naming, repetition, and comprehension. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Muscle tone and strength were normal. In the legs, there was reduced sensation to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the toes to the hips and flanks, with sparing of the anterior trunk and the back. In the arms, there was reduced sensa- tion to pinprick and to temperature that extended from the fingers to the shoulders. The reduced sensation was most pronounced in the fingers and toes. Vibratory sensation and proprioception were decreased below the shins. The reflexes were 2+ in the arms but were absent in the legs. The patient was able to touch the tip of his nose with his index finger when his eyes were open but was unable to do so when his eyes were closed. His gait was unsteady, and the Romberg test was positive.\n\nFigure 1. MRI of the Head.\nMRI of the head was performed 5 days before the current presentation. An axial T2\u2011weighted image (Panel A) and fluid\u2011attenuated in\u2011 version recovery (FLAIR) images (Panels B and C) show mild, nonspecific, scattered foci of hyperintensity involving the supratentorial white matter (Panel C, arrow), with a dominant lesion in the right frontal centrum semiovale and corona radiata (Panels A and B, arrows). There was no associated abnormal enhancement.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. William P. Schmitt: This 33-year-old graduate student \u2014 who had a history of use of alcohol, cocaine, nitrous oxide, lysergic acid  diethylamide, and ketamine \u2014 presented with progressively worsening, painless, symmetric sensory deficits that had begun 8 weeks  earlier,  with  eventual  gait and hand ataxia. Because the patient\u2019s pre- sentation is most consistent with a neurologic process, I will begin by localizing the lesion be-  fore considering the possible causes of his illness.\n\nLocalization\nAlthough imaging of the head in this patient showed a 1.4-cm lesion in the right frontal cen- trum ovale and corona radiata, his symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with a process involving the central nervous system. He appeared to have a pure sensory deficit that started in the toes and progressed proximally to the legs and eventually to the hands and arms; strength was fully preserved, and there were no signs of cranial nerve involvement. The symmetric, progressive nature of the pa- tient\u2019s sensory deficit is suggestive of a process involving the peripheral nerves, the spinal cord, or both. Paresthesia of the arms in conjunction with normal reflexes in the arms may indicate a myelopathic process rather than neuropathy. The patient\u2019s normal results on the strength exami- nation are consistent with a process that is se- lectively affecting the posterior columns of the spinal cord; weakness would be expected if there was involvement of the lateral columns of the spinal cord. However, the absence of reflexes in the legs suggests involvement of the periph- eral nerves as well. He appeared to have a sub- acute, progressively worsening myeloneuropathy involving both the posterior columns of the spi- nal cord and the peripheral nerves of the legs.1 What could cause this?\n\nInfection\nTickborne illness is a consideration in this case, owing to the patient\u2019s recent camping trip. The most common neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease are cranial neuropathies and meningo- encephalitis; patients with Lyme disease can also have polyradiculopathies and, very rarely, transverse myelitis. However, this patient had no prodromal symptoms, such as rash or fever, and serologic tests for Lyme disease were negative. Other tickborne illnesses are unlikely in the absence of systemic symptoms, and myelopathy would be unusual with these illnesses.\nPoliovirus and enteroviruses can cause trans- verse myelitis. However, patients with viral myeli- tis typically present with weakness that pro- gresses over a period of 2 weeks. The absence of weakness during this patient\u2019s steady progres- sion of symptoms over the course of 8 weeks makes viral myelitis very unlikely.1 Infection with varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), or HIV can cause myelopathy. However, this patient did not have evidence of either acute VZV or HSV infection or reactivation of VZV or HSV replication, and the slow pace of illness is not consistent with these infections. HIV infec- tion is unlikely, given the negative screening  test. Syphilis should also be considered in any patient with suspected disease in the posterior columns of the spinal cord. However, classic ta- bes dorsalis (the form of neurosyphilis in which nerves of the posterior columns of the spinal cord degenerate) usually occurs 10 to 20 years after initial untreated infection with Treponema pallidum. Although tabes dorsalis is unlikely in this relatively young patient, I would still recom- mend testing for syphilis.\n\nMechanical Disruption\nMechanical disruption of the cervical spinal cord by a mass, cervical stenosis, or cervical disk disease can produce myelopathic features. How- ever, it would be unusual for a mechanical pro- cess to affect only the posterior columns of the spinal cord, and I would expect the leg reflexes to be brisk as opposed to absent. This patient\u2019s steady progression of symptoms also makes a mass, cervical stenosis, or cervical disk disease unlikely. However, imaging would be necessary to rule out a mechanical process that disrupts the cervical spinal cord.\n\nInflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathies\nAcute inflammatory demyelinating polyneurop- athy (AIDP) and chronic inflammatory demye- linating polyneuropathy (CIDP) can both cause sensory symptoms such as those seen in this pa- tient. However, the course of illness in patients with AIDP usually peaks within 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Although the time course of this patient\u2019s presentation could be consistent with CIDP, both AIDP and CIDP usu- ally affect the motor nerves, which results in weakness. Uncommon variants of CIDP that cause purely sensory effects have been reported; however, the symptoms tend to progress more slowly than those seen in this patient, and loss of reflexes in the arms would be expected.2 In contrast, this patient had paresthesia involving the arms but had normal reflexes in the arms. The negative test for anti\u2013myelin-associated gly- coprotein antibodies also argues against a sen- sory-predominant variant of CIDP.3\nPatients with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome can present\nwith peripheral neuropathy, but myelopathy is rare. Patients with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease can have myelitis, although the presence of myelitis in such patients is usually associated with other central nervous system findings. This patient did not have dry mouth, dry eyes, or enlargement of the salivary glands \u2014 features that would sug- gest Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome \u2014 nor did he have features that would be consistent with Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, such as oral or urogenital lesions. Sar- coidosis can also cause neuropathy and myelitis, which develop over a period of hours to days until a maximum level of myelopathy symptoms is present; the pace of this patient\u2019s illness and the absence of pulmonary symptoms make sar- coidosis an unlikely diagnosis.4\n\nMultiple Sclerosis and Other Autoimmune Diseases\nThe first manifestation of multiple sclerosis commonly includes sensory symptoms that range from mild paresthesia to loss of sensa-\n \n\ntion. Multiple sclerosis can cause myeloneu- ropathy, although the pace of this patient\u2019s progression is atypical for either the relapsing\u2013 remitting or primary progressive form of mul- tiple sclerosis. The relapsing\u2013remitting form of multiple sclerosis, which is the most common form, is characterized by symptoms that occur acutely, over a period of days, before remitting; the pace of this process is too fast to have been present in this case. The primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis progresses slowly in a linear fashion over a period of years, and mo- tor symptoms predominate; the pace of this process is too slow to have been present in this case.5 In addition, patients with multiple scle- rosis typically have asymmetric sensory loss, which reflects the patchy distribution of neuro- logic lesions. This patient had no cranial nerve abnormalities, eye-movement abnormalities, or spasticity that would support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, and the absence of distal leg reflexes would be atypical. Other forms of auto- immune transverse myelitis, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, can also cause symmetric sensory changes; how- ever, such changes are almost always accompa- nied by motor findings, and the pace of evolu- tion is often much faster than that seen in this patient.6-8\n\nCancer\nPatients with paraneoplastic subacute sensory neuronopathy can present with neuropathy that precedes the diagnosis of cancer.9 However, such neuropathy is usually painful, and this patient\u2019s relatively young age and modest smoking history make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nToxic Metabolic Process\nThis patient had several toxic exposures, includ- ing the frequent use of alcohol, cocaine, and nitrous oxide. Alcohol use can lead to peripheral neuropathy, although this outcome is more typi- cal in patients who consume larger amounts of alcohol than this patient described. Also, the progression of symptoms in this patient is more rapid than would be expected for peripheral neuropathy associated with alcohol use. The use of cocaine can cause strokes and nerve infarcts, and a stroke could explain the brain lesion seen on MRI, but cocaine use is not commonly asso- ciated with myelopathy or neuropathy.\n\nPatients with vitamin B12 deficiency can have myeloneuropathy that is caused by dysfunction in the posterior columns of the spinal cord that leads to progressive symmetric loss of sensation in the legs, accompanied by ataxia.10 The condi- tion can progress to involve the arms and, if left untreated, can result in distal neuropathy. Vita- min B12 acts as a critical enzyme that converts homocysteine to methionine (with folate as a cofactor) and converts methylmalonic acid to succinyl coenzyme A. Functional vitamin B12 deficiency causes decreased levels of methio- nine, which in turn impair the production and maintenance of the myelin sheaths of sensory neurons. In addition, functional vitamin B12 de- ficiency results in an increase in the level of methylmalonic acid, which can be neurotoxic. Patients with copper deficiency can have a simi- lar presentation.11 Although this patient did not have typical risk factors for copper deficiency, such as previous bariatric surgery, malnutrition, or overuse of zinc-containing denture cream, I would still measure the blood level of copper.\n \nThis patient\u2019s clinical picture is most consis- tent with vitamin B12 deficiency, even though his vitamin B12 level was normal. Risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency include poor nutrition, impaired absorption of vitamin B12 (e.g., due to pernicious anemia or previous bariatric surgery), or inactivation of vitamin B12 as a result of inter- ference with its catalytic activity. This patient\u2019s frequent use of nitrous oxide (also known as \u201claughing gas\u201d or \u201cwhippets\u201d) may provide the explanation for his presentation. Nitrous oxide irreversibly inhibits the catalytic functions of vitamin B12 by transforming it from the active monovalent form to the inactive bivalent form (Fig. 2).12 Despite the presence of a normal blood level of vitamin B12 in this patient, the vitamin may not have been in a functional form and therefore may have caused the same pathologi- cal process as that which occurs in patients who are deficient in vitamin B12.\nTo establish the diagnosis of functional vita- min B12 deficiency in the context of nitrous oxide use, I would obtain an MRI of the spine to look for enhancement of the posterior columns of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, a finding that would be highly suggestive of vitamin B12 defi- ciency or copper deficiency. I would expect the blood levels of methylmalonic acid and homo- cysteine to be elevated.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Rohatgi: MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was performed (Fig. 3). T2-weighted and short-tau inversion recovery images showed a long segment of hyperintensity involving the cervical and thoracic spine (at C2\u2013C6 and T1\u2013T5) with no associated  enhancement.  An  axial T2-weighted image showed hyperintensity involving the pos- terior columns of the cervical spine in an invert- ed-V pattern. The differential diagnosis of signal change within the cord is broad. After a com- pressive myelopathy or cancer is ruled out, the differential diagnosis can be further narrowed on the basis of the pattern of cord involvement (Fig. 4).14-16 In this patient, the posterior columns of the spinal cord were involved; this pattern is commonly seen in patients with deficiencies of vitamin B12 or copper, in patients with toxic ef- fects from excess ingestion of zinc or from the use of nitrous oxide, or in patients with tertiary syphilis.\nDr. Matiello: The blood levels of copper and zinc were normal, and a screening test for T. pallidum IgG and IgM was negative. The blood methylma- lonic acid level was 6.41 nmol per milliliter (reference value, <0.40) and the blood homocys- teine  level  63.9  \u03bcmol  per  liter  (reference  range, 0 to 14.2). Taken together with the patient\u2019s his- tory of nitrous oxide use and the  findings  on  MRI of the spine, a diagnosis of functional vita- min B12 deficiency from the use of nitrous oxide was made.",
