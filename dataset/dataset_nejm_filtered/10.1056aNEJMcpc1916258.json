    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Justine V. Cohen: A 47-year-old woman with malignant melanoma was seen in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of new abnormal findings on chest imaging.\nThe patient had observed routine quarterly surveillance imaging after resection of right axillary melanoma, radiation therapy, and initiation of pembrolizumab therapy 3 years earlier. The most recent imaging was performed 6 days before this evaluation.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a patchy consolida- tion in the left upper lobe, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and numerous bilateral scattered solid pulmonary nodules with associated ground- glass halos (Fig. 1A through 1D). These findings were new relative to the most recent imaging performed 3 months earlier. Other pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right upper lobe that had been noted on imaging studies obtained during the previous 3 years were stable. Changes in the right upper lobe that had resulted from radiation therapy were also stable relative to previous imaging studies. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a hemangioma in the right hepatic lobe that measured 9 mm in greatest dimension and a cyst in the left hepatic lobe that measured 15 mm in diameter; both were unchanged from previ- ous imaging studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal.\nDr. Cohen: The patient was referred by her oncologist for urgent evaluation in the\npulmonary clinic of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported no symp- toms, specifically no fever, weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, malaise, headache,chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, new or changed skin lesions (except a mild traumatic abrasion on the right arm), pruritus, or new masses.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for superficial spreading melanoma on the right up- per back that had initially been diagnosed two decades before this evaluation and had been surgically excised, with clear pathological margins. Eleven years later, an in situ superficial spreading melanoma developed on the left upper back and was completely excised.\nDr. Shepard: Three years before the current evaluation, locally advanced melanoma in the right axilla was diagnosed on the basis of a positron-emission tomographic and CT image that showed a 3.5-cm right axillary nodal conglomerate mass with multiple foci of intense 18F-f luorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake; no other sites of FDG avidity were seen (Fig. 1E and 1F). Multiple pulmonary nodules, measuring 2 to 4 mm in greatest dimension, in the right lobe and hypo- dense hepatic lesions, measuring 9 mm in the right lobe and 10 mm in the left lobe, were noted. MRI of the abdomen suggested that the hepatic lesion in the right lobe corresponded to a hemangioma and the hepatic lesion in the left lobe a cyst. MRI of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous con- trast material, was normal.\nDr. Cohen: At that time, dissection of the right\naxillary lymph nodes was performed, and exam- ination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 25 of 39 lymph nodes, with a high degree of extracapsular extension. Molec- ular profiling identified the BRAF V600E muta- tion. The patient received radiation therapy to the right axilla and supraclavicular fossa (total dose of 4800 cGy over a period of 5 weeks), fol- lowed by pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for the next 12 months. During this course of treat- ment, lichenoid nodules developed on the fin- gers of both hands, tenosynovitis developed in the right ankle, and hypothyroidism was diag- nosed, for which treatment with levothyroxine was initiated. These findings were attributed to adverse effects of the immune checkpoint in- hibitor therapy. The plan for surveillance imag- ing included CT of the chest, abdomen, and pel- vis, which was to be performed every 3 months, and MRI of the head, which was to be performed annually.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history also included\nbilateral ovarian cysts, osteopenia, and a mela- nocytoma of the left optic disc that had been stable for at least 13 years. A Papanicolaou smear and testing for high-risk human papillo- mavirus performed 3 years before this evaluation had been negative. Routine screening mammog- raphy performed 1 month before this evaluation had revealed dense breast tissue with bilateral calcifications that appeared to be benign; no sus- picious lesions were noted. Medications included calcium carbonate, cholecalciferol, and levothy- roxine. There were no known drug allergies.\nThe patient was born on the northern coast of South America and had immigrated to the United States as a child. She lived in New England with her husband, two children, and two cats.She worked in the health care industry. She drank one or two glasses of wine per day and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. One month before this evaluation, she and her fam- ily had traveled to the northern coast of South America for 1 week. On the trip, the patient spent most her time outdoors, including taking trips to the jungle and swimming in fresh water, and ate local cuisine, such as water chestnuts. When she returned home with her family, her husband and one of her children had general- ized myalgias and malaise that resolved spontaneously.\nThe patient\u2019s mother had breast cancer, melanoma, and basal-cell carcinoma; her father had prostate cancer; and her daughter had mixed connective-tissue disease. Her maternal grandfa- ther had colon cancer, her paternal grandmother had breast cancer, and her maternal cousin had melanoma.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the blood pressure 123/68 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was\n20.8. She appeared well, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. Examination showed fair skin, multiple nevi without suspicious features, and healed scars at the sites of previous surgical procedures. There were lichenoid nodules on the fingers of both hands. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nThe levels of electrolytes, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were results of renal- and liver-function tests. The complete blood count and differential count were also normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuber- culosis was negative, and the level of 1,3-\u03b2-d- glucan was less than 31 pg per milliliter (refer- ence value, <60).",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Katrina A. Armstrong: The construction of a differential diagnosis and selection of diagnos- tic tests are two steps in the cycle of clinical decision making that underlies much of medi- cine (Fig. 2). Often, this cycle begins with defining the problem representation (typically a one- sentence summary that describes the important features of a case), which then leads to develop- ing the list of possible diagnoses and estimating the probability of each diagnosis. This list, to- gether with information about the accuracy and risks of possible diagnostic tests, then leads to a diagnostic testing strategy that informs the de- cision about possible treatments. Although I will focus on the decision about diagnostic testing, the cycle does not end with the test or even with the treatment; rather, it depends on longitudinal assessment of response and the potential to re- define the problem representation and enter the cycle again if diagnostic uncertainty increases.\n\nProblem Representation\nFollowing this paradigm, the problem represen- tation in this case includes key facts about the patient (i.e., she is in her 40s, she received im- munotherapy for metastatic melanoma, and she recently traveled to South America) and key signs and symptoms (i.e., finding of bilateral pulmo- nary nodules, hilar and mediastinal lymphade- nopathy, and left upper lobe infiltrate without associated symptoms). Timing is also important, with key dates showing that the patient had com- pleted pembrolizumab treatment 2 years before the current presentation and had not had lung disease or evidence of melanoma since that time.\n\nAssessing Probabilities of Diagnoses\nIdeally, once we have defined the problem repre- sentation, we should be able to translate the representation into probabilities of various diag- noses. Finding that information can be surpris- ingly challenging. Most clinical studies describe patients with a given diagnosis, thereby enabling the assessment of the probability that, for exam- ple, patients with sarcoidosis have hilar lymph- adenopathy, but not the probability that patients with hilar lymphadenopathy have sarcoidosis. Useful information can sometimes be found in studies evaluating new diagnostic tests. Two studies that evaluated the use of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspira- tion in determining the underlying causes of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy provide information about the final diagnoses of the patients.1,2 In the two studies, the final diagno- sis was reactive lymphadenopathy in 29% and 48% of the patients, sarcoidosis in 43% and 20%, carcinoma or lymphoma in 21% and 13%, and granulomatous infections (i.e., tuberculosis or fungus) in 5% and 18%. Reactive lymphade- nopathy occurs when a patient has an underly- ing pulmonary process, such as chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, or bronchiectasis, all of which are unlikely diag- noses in this patient, given her normal imaging studies before this presentation. Rare diseases that were diagnosed in these studies included silicosis, amyloidosis, and Castleman\u2019s disease.\nAlthough the studies provide some sense of the relative likelihood of the various diagnoses, the probability of a particular diagnosis in this patient depends on the specifics of her presenta- tion. One of the two studies provides informa- tion about the characteristics of the patients, according to diagnosis.2 For example, all the patients who had carcinoma had symptoms at presentation \u2014 most commonly, weight loss (86%). In contrast, only 75% of the patients with sarcoidosis had symptoms on presentation. This information can be used to determine the prob- ability of a specific diagnosis given this patient\u2019s problem representation. For example, when the absence of weight loss at presentation is includ- ed in the calculation for probability, the result is a 97% chance that the lymphadenopathy is not a manifestation of cancer, information that is greatly reassuring in this patient with a history of metastatic melanoma. Interestingly, the pres- ence of both hilar and mediastinal lymphade- nopathy has little effect on the probabilities of the various diagnoses. Although lymphadenopa- thy is always seen in patients with sarcoidosis, it is also relatively common in patients with other diagnoses. On the basis of this information, the likelihood that the lymphadenopathy represents reactive lymphadenopathy or cancer is low, leav- ing sarcoidosis and granulomatous infection as the most likely diagnoses in this case.\nDistinguishing between sarcoidosis and a granulomatous infectious process can be chal- lenging, since they are driven by a similar im- mune reaction to one or more antigens. The challenge may be particularly great in this pa- tient, given the previous treatment with pembro- lizumab, a programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibi- tor.3 PD-1 inhibitors prevent down-regulation of the immune response, particularly the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, enabling an immune response against cells that express PD-1 ligands, with the primary target being cells from tumors such as melanoma. However, PD-1 inhibition is also associated with an array of autoimmune syndromes in which activated T cells attack nor- mal cells.4 These syndromes can affect almost any organ and may explain the development of hypothyroidism and tenosynovitis in this patient. Notably, the use of pembrolizumab has been as- sociated with a sarcoidosis-like syndrome with bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and the finding of noncaseating granulomas on biopsy of lymphoid tissue.5,6 Few patients in whom the sarcoidosis-like syndrome was reported had pulmonary nodules or parenchymal involvement, but approximately one third had cutaneous man- ifestations. Nearly all these autoimmune syn- dromes were reported to have developed while the patients were receiving pembrolizumab treat- ment, with the caveat that available follow-up data after treatment remained limited; in one patient, cutaneous sarcoidosis was reported to have developed months after treatment ended. Given that there were 2 years between the time of this patient\u2019s presentation and the last dose of PD-1 inhibitor therapy, a sarcoidosis-like syn- drome associated with a PD-1 inhibitor is unlikely.\nIf this patient\u2019s presentation is unlikely to represent an autoimmune complication of PD-1 inhibitor therapy, then a granulomatous infec- tion becomes a more likely diagnosis. The most common pulmonary infections that are mani- fested by hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopa- thy are tuberculosis and fungal infections, primar- ily coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis and, less commonly, blastomycosis and cryptococcal disease. Pulmonary infiltrates with lymphade- nopathy are commonly seen with primary tuber- culosis but not with reactivation of the disease. However, primary tuberculosis is uncommon in immunocompetent adults and generally mani- fests with cough, fever, and fatigue. Further- more, given the patient\u2019s negative interferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis, the probability of this diagnosis is low.\nBoth coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis\ncan be manifested by pulmonary infiltrates, nodules, and lymphadenopathy in immunocom- petent hosts.7,8 With both infections, pulmonary nodules can have ground-glass halos on CT \u2014 a finding associated with an adjacent area of hem- orrhage or tissue injury. However, a halo sign occurs with other conditions, and information about its predictive ability is hard to find. Pa- tients who have either coccidioidomycosis or his- toplasmosis are usually asymptomatic, but 40% of patients with coccidioidomycosis have an influ- enza-like illness with fever, cough, and fatigue. Distinguishing between these infections often depends on a patient\u2019s history of exposure. Ex- posure to the fungi that cause either infection is unlikely in the northeastern region of the United States, making this patient\u2019s trip to South Amer- ica her most likely source of exposure \u2014 a hy- pothesis that is supported by the presence of the concomitant mild febrile illnesses of her family members. Histoplasmosis is far more common than coccidioidomycosis in that region.9 A nega- tive 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan test lowers the probability of both diagnoses but does not rule out either one.10 Thus, histoplasmosis becomes the most likely diagnosis in this case.\nIn the end, the decision is not which diagnosis is correct but whether further diagnostic test- ing is needed and, if so, which tests should be done. In this case, considerable diagnostic un- certainty remains, in part because the effect of previous PD-1 inhibitor treatment on subsequent immune responses is largely unknown. Possible diagnostic tests include measurement of the blood level of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), assays for fungal antigens and antibod- ies, and a biopsy of the lymphadenopathy, prob- ably with the use of endobronchial ultrasound- guided transbronchial needle aspiration, given its greater yield than traditional transbronchial needle aspiration. Although ACE testing has limited predictive ability, it could be considered, since it is safe, has a low cost, and, if the result is normal, lowers the probability that the diag- nosis is sarcoidosis.11 Histoplasma antigen test- ing is helpful in both ruling out and confirming histoplasmosis with clinically significant dis- ease, is safe and inexpensive, and should be performed in this case.10 If histoplasma antigen testing is unrevealing or if diagnostic uncer- tainty remains after these tests, a biopsy should be performed.\nDr. Jonathan A. Stefely: Histologic examination of the lung-biopsy specimen revealed a granuloma- tous cellular infiltrate (Fig. 4A). This finding could suggest metastatic melanoma, given the patient\u2019s history and the diverse histologic ap- pearances of this disease. However, on immuno- histochemical analysis, the lung-biopsy specimen did not show the melanoma markers HMB45 and S100.\nThe lymph node\u2013biopsy specimen also con- tained numerous granulomas (Fig. 4B), a non- specific finding that can indicate infection, auto- immune disease, or cancer. In this case, the presence of focal necrosis increased suspicion for infection. A stain for acid-fast bacteria showed no mycobacteria. However, Gomori methena- mine silver staining highlighted numerous yeast cells, measuring 2 to 4 \u03bcm in diameter, with narrow-based budding (Fig. 4C), which could represent either Candida glabrata13 or Histoplasma capsulatum.14\nA microbiologic evaluation performed in par- allel revealed growth of a tan-white mold after 12 days of incubation at 30\u00b0C. Microscopic ex- amination with lactophenol cotton-blue stain showed slender septate hyphae, microconidia,and conidia with characteristic protrusions called tubercles that lend a f lower-like appearance (Fig. 4D). Notably, this mold grew from a tissue specimen containing yeast, indicating that it was a dimorphic fungus. Dimorphic fungi include\nH. capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Sporothrix schenckii, coccidioides species, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, and Penicillium marneffei, with H. capsulatum being the most likely in this case, given its 2-to- 4-\u03bcm size. Additional molecular testing with a chemiluminescent DNA probe that targets\nH. capsulatum ribosomal RNA was positive. In isolation, this finding could indicate either of two variants \u2014 H. capsulatum var. capsulatum or H. cap- sulatum var. duboisii \u2014 but H. capsulatum var. duboisii is found only in Africa and those cells typically measure 6 to 12 \u03bcm in diameter.15 Taken together, the findings indicate infection by H. capsulatum var. capsulatum. In addition, a blood test for his- toplasma antigen, an indirect marker of histo- plasmosis burden, was low-positive (i.e., the antigen was detectable but below the limit of quantification).\n",

Folch: In cases such as this one, in which enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are present, as well as multiple peripheral lung lesions, we favor diagnostic approaches that provide access to both the mediastinum and the lung parenchyma. Ideally, we would obtain adequate tissue for histopathological and micro- biologic analysis during the same episode of anesthesia. Initially, we considered accessing the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes by means of linear endobronchial ultrasonography, followed by the use of electromagnetic navigation bron- choscopy or robotic bronchoscopy to access the parenchymal pulmonary nodules. However, dur- ing a careful review of this patient\u2019s imaging studies, we identified parenchymal lesions ame- nable to esophageal access by means of endo- scopic ultrasonography and by endoscopic ultra- sonography with a bronchoscope. We presumed that the lymphadenopathy and the pulmonary nodules were probably caused by the same pro- cess, but the diagnostic yield of infection is not as high as that of cancer.12\nWe  performed a flexible bronchoscopy with\nendobronchial  ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum and hila (stations 11R, 7, and 11L) (Fig. 3). The rapid on-site evaluation of the specimens revealed no cancer cells, so we pro- ceeded with obtaining parenchymal lung-biopsy specimens through the esophagus. We used en- doscopic ultrasonography with a bronchoscope to obtain a biopsy specimen of the pulmonary nodule that had been noted in the right lower lobe near the esophagus (Fig. 3).\n",
