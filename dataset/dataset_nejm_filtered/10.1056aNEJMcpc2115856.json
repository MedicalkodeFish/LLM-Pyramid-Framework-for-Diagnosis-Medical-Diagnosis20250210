    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Amiko M. Uchida (Medicine): A 57-year-old man was evaluated in the gastroen- terology clinic of this hospital because of new ascites.\nTwenty years before the current presentation, the patient began to have swelling of the legs, which initially occurred only after airplane trips. During the fifth decade of life, the leg swelling was present on a daily basis. Thirteen years before the current presentation, the patient began to have frequent bowel movements (up to four per day) with loose malodorous stools and increased flatus. He was evalu- ated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. On examination, the abdomen was soft and nontender, with no evidence of organomegaly. There was pitting edema in both legs. The blood level of total protein was 5.5 g per deciliter (refer- ence range, 6.0 to 8.3), and the blood albumin level was 3.1 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.3 to 5.0). Results of other liver-function tests, including liver enzyme levels, were normal. The protein level in a 24-hour urine sample was normal. The blood alpha1-antitrypsin level was 173 mg per deciliter (reference value, <54).\nBlood levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM were low. Serologic tests for anti\u2013tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-giardia antibodies were negative.\nDr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomographic (CT) enterography of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed diffuse mural thickening and hyperenhancement of the small bowel, with no evidence of stricturing or obstruction (Fig. 1A and 1B). In addition, there was trace ascites (Fig. 1B).\nDr. Uchida: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy revealed no visible abnormalities. A random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed a focal area with more than 70 eosinophils per high-power field; a biopsy specimen of the gastric antrum showed scattered eosinophils in the lamina propria. A working diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy was made, although neither a 2-week course of oral prednisone nor a 6-week course of oral budesonide led to a decrease in the number of bowel movements or leg edema. No further treatment was pursued.\n\nEleven years before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated in the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital. There had been no weight loss or recurrent infections, but leg edema per- sisted. Repeat EGD revealed no visible abnor- malities, and a random biopsy specimen of the duodenum showed fewer eosinophils than the previous specimen, with no epithelial damage. CT enterography revealed diffuse wall thicken- ing of the entire small bowel and trace ascites. Treatment for protein-losing enteropathy \u2014 which included limiting salt intake, increasing dietary protein, and wearing compression stock- ings \u2014 was recommended. During the next 10 years, the leg edema was stable and was occa- sionally treated with diuretic agents, which did not lead to substantial improvement.\nSix months before the current  presentation,\nthe patient began to have dyspnea on exertion. Three months before this presentation, abdomi- nal distention developed. The patient initially attributed the dyspnea and abdominal distention to weight gain due to reduced physical activity during quarantine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Six weeks before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care physician in a video conference. On the basis of this evaluation, laboratory and im- aging studies were obtained. The blood level of total protein was 4.5 g per deciliter (updated reference range, 6.4 to 8.3), and the blood albu- min level was 2.1 g per deciliter. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes and glucose, and results of liver-function and kidney- function tests were normal.\nDr. Anderson: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, revealed multiple small pulmonary nodules, enlarged subcarinal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, and moderate-volume ascites in the upper abdomen.\nDr. Uchida: Three weeks later, paracentesis was performed, and 3.1 liters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic f luid analysis are shown in Table 1. Cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid revealed no ma- lignant cells. The patient was referred to the gastroenterology clinic of this hospital for fur- ther evaluation.\nOn the current presentation, the patient reported that he was having bowel movements with normally formed stools and no abdominal pain. His wife had noticed that he appeared to be moving slowly when performing activities of daily living and that he had lost muscle mass in his arms. There was no history of abdominal surgery or trauma to the abdomen. Other medi- cal history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, osteoarthritis, and hypogammaglobu- linemia. There was no history of recurrent infec- tions, asthma, or atopic dermatitis. Medications included aspirin, insulin glargine, and metfor- min. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with his wife in a suburb of Boston and worked in an office. He was a lifelong non- smoker, drank alcohol occasionally, and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had colon cancer.\nThe physical examination was limited, be-\ncause the evaluation was done in a video confer- ence in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Anderson: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intrave- nous and oral contrast material, revealed multi- ple new hypoenhancing lesions throughout the right and left hepatic lobes, diffuse small-bowel wall thickening, moderate-volume ascites, upper abdominal varices, and enlarged upper abdomi- nal and pelvic nodes (Fig. 1C, 1D, and 1E). The only liver lesions that were large enough for reli- able percutaneous sampling were at the far cra- nial aspect of the hepatic dome, where respira- tory motion and crossing the diaphragm would have made an attempt at CT-guided or ultrasono- graphically guided biopsy very challenging, if not prohibitive. CT of the chest revealed tree-in-bud and clustered nodules, predominantly in the de- pendent lower lobes, and right hilar and subcari- nal lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1F).\nDr. Uchida: Tests for hepatitis C virus antibod- ies and for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies, surface antigen, and core antibodies were nega- tive. Repeat paracentesis was performed, and 3.2\tliters of milky-appearing ascitic fluid were removed. Results of the ascitic fluid analysis are shown in Table 1. An acid-fast stain of a concen- trated specimen of ascitic f luid was negative. Cytologic examination of the ascitic f luid re- vealed no malignant cells. A f luoroscopically guided transjugular liver biopsy was also per- formed. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was 2 mm Hg (normal value, <5); the right atrial pressure was 7 mm Hg, the wedged hepatic venous pressure 11 mm Hg, and the free hepatic venous pressure 9 mm Hg.\nDr. Megan J. Fitzpatrick: Histologic examination of the liver-biopsy specimen revealed mild mixed portal inflammation and grade 1 steatosis with- out steatohepatitis. A trichrome stain showed mild portal tract edema but no fibrosis.\nDr. Uchida: Mycobacterial cultures of the as- citic fluid were negative. \n\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael Dougan: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagno- sis. This 57-year-old man with a previous diag- nosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis presented with a relatively new onset of rapidly accumulat- ing chylous ascites. He had signs of muscle wasting and reported increasing difficulty with performing activities of daily living. In develop- ing an initial differential diagnosis, two promi- nent features of this patient\u2019s presentation stand out: the previous diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy in the presence of eosinophilic in- flammatory disease, and the new and rapidly worsening chylous ascites. The first question to address is whether the development of chylous ascites is related to the eosinophilic inflamma- tory disease.\n\nEosinophilic Gastroenteritis\nEosinophilic gastroenteritis is an eosinophilic inflammatory disease of the gut. Common symp- toms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.1 Protein-losing enteropathy, which was present in this patient, can occur. Ascites is a rare manifestation of the disease. This patient had a smoldering course of eosinophilic gastro- enteritis that had lasted for nearly 15 years, which is typical for this slowly progressive dis- ease. However, his current presentation with rapidly progressive accumulation of chylous as- cites is suggestive of a new process that is prob- ably unrelated to the previous diagnosis of eo- sinophilic gastroenteritis. Therefore, I will focus the differential diagnosis on causes of chylous ascites.\n\nChylous Ascites\nChylous ascites is a rare form of ascites that is characterized by the accumulation of protein- rich and chylomicron-rich lymphatic fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Lymph is generated from fluid that is squeezed out of the vasculature, filtered through the tissues, and then collected in the lymphatic ducts. In the gastrointestinal mucosa of the small intestine, this fluid contains chylo- microns that are the primary mechanism for transporting long-chain fatty acids from digest- ed food. The presence of chylomicrons gives gut lymphatic fluid a milky-white appearance, which can also be observed in chylous ascites. Chylous ascites is distinct from other, more common  types of ascites that are often categorized with the use of the serum\u2013ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). Ascites associated with a high SAAG (>1.1) is often seen in patients with portal hyper- tension due to cirrhosis but can also be seen in patients with heart failure. Ascites associated with a low SAAG is typical of inflammatory states.\nIt can be useful to divide the causes of chy- lous ascites into two physiological categories (Fig. 2). The first category includes conditions that cause disruption of the lymphatic vascula- ture, resulting in leakage of lymph from the lymphatic system into the peritoneal space. Lym- phatic disruption is usually caused by duct dam- age from abdominal surgery; nonsurgical trauma is a less common cause.2 This patient had no history of abdominal surgery or recent or remote trauma to the abdomen. The second category includes conditions that cause obstruction of the lymphatic vasculature. Lymphatic obstruction can occur through either direct blockage of the lymphatics or impaired drainage into the venous system, the latter of which can be caused by congestive heart failure or portal hypertension due to cirrhosis.\nPortal Hypertension\nPortal hypertension is a frequent cause of chy- lous ascites that is not related to lymphatic in- jury. At the time of our initial evaluation, we had not yet measured the HVPG, which ultimately ruled out portal hypertension in this patient.\nIn patients with cirrhosis, portal hypertension increases shear stress in splanchnic capillaries, which increases the release of nitric oxide and results in systemic vasodilation. Systemic vaso- dilation activates baroreceptors, which in turn trigger the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, causing retention of salt and water. Fluid can accumulate in the peritoneal space, generating low-protein ascites. For reasons that are not clear, in a small proportion of patients with cir- rhosis, chylous ascites develops. One possible explanation is that increased venous pressure prevents efficient lymphatic drainage into the veins, which leads to lymphatic hypertension and a loss of lymph into the peritoneal cavity.\nOn the basis of the information we had be-\nfore the liver biopsy was performed, could portal hypertension due to cirrhosis be a possible cause of chylous ascites in this patient? Some of the imaging features, including the upper abdomi- nal varices, are suggestive of portal hyperten- sion, but these findings are not specific, particu- larly because the patient did not have any clear risk factors for cirrhosis. He had negative tests for hepatitis viruses; serologic testing for auto- immune diseases was not performed. He had type 2 diabetes, but he did not have any other features of metabolic syndrome that would put him at increased risk for steatohepatitis. He drank alcohol infrequently, so liver disease due to alcohol consumption is unlikely. His labora- tory test results were notable for hypoalbumin- emia, which can occur with cirrhosis but is more likely to be explained by his known diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy. Although his hepatic imaging studies showed abnormalities, the le- sions identified were not typical of cirrhosis and were more suggestive of an infiltrative process.\nLymphatic Obstruction\nEven before the liver biopsy was performed and the HVPG was measured (which definitively ruled out cirrhosis), the patient did not have evi- dence to support a diagnosis of cirrhosis or other causes of venous congestion, and the dif- ferential diagnosis was narrowed to other causes of lymphatic obstruction. These can be grouped as inflammatory, infectious, and cancer-related causes.\nInflammatory causes of lymphatic obstruction include sarcoidosis, radiation exposure, and peritoneal fibrosis. The patient had no other signs of these inflammatory conditions, so they are unlikely diagnoses in this case. Similarly, the patient had no risk factors for infectious causes of lymphatic obstruction, such as filariasis or mycobacterial disease, although the absence of risk factors cannot rule out these infections. Therefore, cancer appears to be the most likely cause of an infiltrative disease of the liver that has led to lymphatic obstruction and chylous ascites in this patient. Although he did not have a known primary cancer, B-cell lymphomas of- ten manifest with lymphatic disease, are an im- portant cause of chylous ascites, and could also explain the liver abnormalities seen on CT. B-cell lymphomas can be aggressive, with rapid growth and worsening of symptoms over a period of a few weeks, which would be consistent with this patient\u2019s illness.\nSeveral diagnostic strategies can help to es- tablish the diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma. These include sampling of ascitic f luid, as well as bi- opsy of the mesentery or mesenteric lymph nodes, the gastrointestinal mucosa, or the liver. In this patient, no malignant cells were identi- fied in ascitic fluid, and an acid-fast stain and mycobacterial cultures were negative. We ulti- mately opted to perform a liver biopsy. We chose a transjugular approach because the liver lesions detected on CT were either too small or too close to the diaphragm to be reliably and safely sam- pled with a guided biopsy; also, a transjugular approach would allow for measurement of the HVPG. We elected not to pursue further imag- ing, such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose\u2013positron- emission tomography (FDG-PET), without a his- tologic diagnosis.\nUnfortunately, the transjugular liver biopsy\ndid not result in a definitive diagnosis, probably because we were unable to obtain adequate tis- sue samples.5 The biopsy specimens were gener- ally small and were not targeted to the abnor- malities observed on CT, because the biopsy was not performed with CT guidance. B-cell lym- phoma remained at the top of the differential diagnosis, so the patient next underwent a CT- guided transabdominal liver biopsy, which al- lowed the proceduralist to attempt to visualize the targeted area of interest.\n\n\n\n\n",
