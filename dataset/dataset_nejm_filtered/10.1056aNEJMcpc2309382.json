    "Primary Symptom": "A 39-Year-Old Man with Fever and Headache after International Travel",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Hayden S. Andrews (Medicine): A 39-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital during the summer because of fever with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and fatigue, which had lasted for the 4 days since he had returned from a trip to East Africa.\nDuring the patient\u2019s 2-week trip, he had been on a safari in Tanzania but had not had any contact with animals. He reported that he had received mosquito bites, especially during the first days of the trip. He had eaten cooked shrimp and lobster and a small amount of raw tuna. On the second-to-last day of the trip, nausea, vomiting, and nonbloody diarrhea developed. On the last day of the trip, the patient had fatigue and slept for much of the day; however, he felt well enough to travel home the next day.\nOn the night the patient returned home to Massachusetts, he began to have fever with a temperature of 38.3\u00b0C, along with shaking chills, diffuse headache, and lower back pain. The following day, he presented to an urgent care facility because of fever, malaise, and headache. The oral temperature was 38.5\u00b0C; the remainder of the examination was normal. Nucleic acid testing was negative for influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Oral prednisone was prescribed for the treatment of headache. On the third day home, in the evening, the patient had fever with a temperature of 39.5\u00b0C and lower back pain. The next morning, 4 days after returning from the trip, he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported recurrent fevers accompa- nied by blurry vision, which had occurred despite the use of acetaminophen, ibu- profen, and prednisone. He reported ongoing weakness and anorexia, noting that he was consuming mostly fruits and electrolyte-replacement solutions. He had had nausea with diarrhea but without vomiting. The patient noted that his urine output had decreased and that the urine appeared darker than usual. Review of systems was negative for myalgias, rash, neck stiffness, photophobia, respiratory symptoms, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, and joint pain. His travel companion reported no symptoms. The patient reported no known tick exposures before or during travel in Tanzania.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for degenerative knee disease with a meniscus tear, for which he had received glucocorticoid injections. There were no known adverse drug reactions. He had received a series of three vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2. He lived with his partner in a suburb of Boston. He had been a competitive athlete and was employed in the energy industry. He drank beer occasionally and did not use tobacco or other substances.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the pulse 96 beats per minute, the blood pressure 113/62 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 104.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 30.3. Facial flushing and mild scleral icterus were present. The urine was dark brown. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of calcium, creatine kinase, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An extended respiratory viral panel and a screening test for Lyme disease IgM and IgG antibodies were negative. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood, and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment showed 3 to 5 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2). Specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed nonspecific minor T-wave inversions.\nDr. Marc D. Succi: A single-view frontal image from portable chest radiography (Fig. 1A) showed clear lungs without evidence of pneumonia, pul- monary edema, or pleural effusion. The heart size was normal, and there was no radiographic evi- dence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The bones were normal. A limited abdominal ultrasound im- age (Fig. 1B), obtained to evaluate the liver and biliary system only, showed mild hepatic steatosis but was otherwise unremarkable.\nDr. Andrews: Lactated Ringer\u2019s solution and magnesium sulfate were administered intrave- nously, and acetaminophen and ibuprofen were administered orally. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Edward T. Ryan: I am aware of the final diag- nosis in this case; however, much can be garnered by considering the differential diagnosis and clini- cal approach to this patient\u2019s presentation. We will consider the cause of a febrile illness in a previ- ously healthy 39-year-old man who resides in the United States and recently traveled to Tanzania for 2 weeks. Two days before he returned home from this trip, nonbloody diarrhea developed in the patient. He began to have fever, chills, lower back pain, and headache immediately upon re- turning home. Despite these symptoms and signs, there was an absence of findings on physical ex- amination; he did not have any obvious skin le- sions, pulmonary abnormalities, organomegaly, or lymphadenopathy. However, there were sev- eral striking laboratory abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, elevated blood levels of aspar- tate aminotransferase and alanine aminotrans- ferase, hyperbilirubinemia, mild renal dysfunction, a low haptoglobin level, and hematuria (3+) with only few red cells noted on urinalysis. The white- cell count was normal, and there was evidence of possible hemoconcentration, a finding sugges- tive of dehydration or capillary leak syndrome.\nWhen evaluating a patient for possible causes of fever after international travel, clinicians con- sider the destination and the time since the trip, any risk factors, the constellation and duration of symptoms and signs, abnormalities on physi- cal examination and laboratory analysis, and imaging findings, if pertinent.1 A febrile illness in an international traveler may be related to the trip causally or only temporally. The illness could be caused by an infectious disease endemic in either the destination or home region, a common process (e.g., a urinary tract infection, pneumo- nia, or influenza), or a noninfectious disease. In constructing a differential diagnosis, I will con- sider two central clinical features of this patient\u2019s case: nonbloody diarrhea and a febrile illness manifesting at the end of a 2-week trip to sub- Saharan Africa.\nCommon Causes of Diarrhea\nDiarrhea is a common ailment reported after international travel,2 and an acute diarrheal syn- drome with fever and myalgias can be caused by a number of invasive enteric pathogens, including salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and yersinia species. Diarrhea with fever is also associated with a number of viruses, such as enterovirus and norovirus, although the degree and duration of fever in this patient would be atypical for an infection with one of those entities. The patient had clinically significant thrombocytopenia with normal white-cell and differential counts, as well as laboratory data suggestive of hemolysis, includ- ing a low haptoglobin level and hemoglobinuria (hematuria [3+] with a paucity of red cells on urinalysis). An intestinal infection with Shigella dysenteriae or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli can be associated with bloody diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, and renal dysfunction; however, S. dysen- teriae infection is relatively rare, and patients with enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection usually have mild or no fever. Moreover, this patient described the diarrhea as nonbloody.\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should also be considered as a noninfectious cause of fe- ver, headache, renal dysfunction, and hemolytic anemia. In this case, we were not told whether schistocytes were present on examination of the peripheral-blood smear.\n\nViral Syndromes\nArboviral infections, a common cause of febrile illnesses associated with international travel, in- clude dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus infections, among others. The priority should be to rule out dengue fever, since this illness can be severe and supportive care can substantially improve outcomes. Dengue fever usually develops in patients within a few days after a mosquito bite and can manifest as a nonspecific febrile illness with headache, body aches, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aspartate amino- transferase and alanine aminotransferase levels; dengue shock syndrome may lead to capillary leak syndrome with hemoconcentration. Many patients with dengue fever have a flush of petechiae dis- tal to the tightening of a tourniquet on an arm, a sign of capillary fragility. Hemolytic anemia, however, is not common in patients with dengue fever, and this patient did not have leukopenia.\nOther viral syndromes that could explain some\nof the features present in this patient include Lassa fever, yellow fever, Crimean\u2013Congo hemor- rhagic fever, and filovirus infections, such as Ebola virus disease or Marburg virus disease. However, Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa, not East Africa. Tanzania is considered to be in an area at low risk for yellow fever transmission, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) generally does not recommend yellow fever vac- cination for travel to Tanzania. Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever is associated with the occur- rence of a tick bite and is most often reported in agricultural workers or those working with ani- mals. Cases of Ebola virus disease have not been reported in Tanzania. There was an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in northern Tanzania in 2023, but no cases were reported when this pa- tient visited. We are unaware of any outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic diseases at his destination, and the patient did not report traveling to a region affected by the outbreak of Marburg virus dis- ease or participating in activities associated with filovirus transmission, including contact with in- fected humans or animals.\nBacterial Infections\nA diagnosis of leptospirosis could explain several of the features of this patient\u2019s presentation, in- cluding the nonspecific febrile illness, elevations in hepatic aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction; how- ever, hemolytic anemia would be an atypical fea- ture. Rickettsial infections, including African tick typhus (caused by Rickettsia africae), can also cause a nonspecific febrile illness. However, a derma- tologic examination did not show abnormalities consistent with a corresponding tick bite, such as an eschar. Typhoid fever is another cause of a nonspecific febrile illness in international travel- ers. Salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid fever, enters the body through the intestinal system; however, diarrhea is not a common feature dur- ing the febrile stage, which usually occurs 1 to 3 weeks after the ingestion of organisms. This patient\u2019s degree of thrombocytopenia and hemo- lytic anemia would not be typical features of typhoid fever. Plague is a possible consideration, but this patient did not have any buboes or pul- monary findings that would be consistent with this diagnosis. Tanzania is south of the African meningitis belt, and no petechiae were reported; therefore, the likelihood of invasive meningo- coccal disease is low.\nParasitic Diseases\nEast African trypanosomiasis can occur in Tanza- nia, but no tsetse fly bites were reported, and no skin chancres were noted on examination. Babe- siosis can cause hemolytic anemia and fever; the patient is a resident of New England, and he pre- sented with a febrile illness during the summer. If babesiosis were the diagnosis, it would be un- related to his travel, only clinically manifesting toward the end of his 2-week overseas trip. Babe- siosis and East African trypanosomiasis can be diagnosed by means of examination of a periph- eral-blood smear. These illnesses are not usually associated with diarrhea, but it is possible that the diarrhea and febrile illness are unrelated and represent two distinct processes. However, the di- agnosis most likely to cause a febrile illness with hemolysis, hyperbilirubinemia, a normal white-cell count, and thrombocytopenia, presenting at the end of a 2-week trip to East Africa in a person who did not receive chemoprophylaxis, would be malaria, specifically that caused by Plasmodium falciparum.\nMalaria\nMost cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States occur during the U.S. summer months among patients who have traveled to sub-Saharan Africa.3 The majority of cases are diagnosed in patients who did not receive chemoprophylaxis. People born overseas who return there to visit friends or relatives are also at particular risk. Five species of malaria parasites can infect hu- mans, although most travelers infected in Africa acquire P. falciparum. Most patients infected with\nP. falciparum present with a nonspecific febrile illness with headache, chills, and myalgias, symp- toms that usually develop within 4 to 12 weeks after the infectious mosquito bite.3 Diarrhea can also occur, as well as cough or shortness of breath. In 2023, cases of malaria caused by P. vivax were diagnosed in patients residing in Florida and Texas who had not traveled, which indicated local acquisition.4 These cases show that mosquitoes capable of transmitting malaria exist in the United States and that limited local or ongoing transmission can occur after the importation of malaria into home communities.\nThis patient was evaluated for influenza,\nCovid-19, and tickborne illnesses endemic in New England. The recommendation was to return for further evaluation for malaria if the initial evalu- ation was negative and fever persisted. The pa- tient was also empirically treated with glucocor- ticoids for unclear reasons. Caring for a patient with fever after international travel requires a thorough evaluation, which includes obtaining a detailed history of pertinent exposures, epidemio- logic factors, immunization status, and chemo- prophylaxis status, as well as performing a meticulous physical examination. P. falciparum malaria can be rapidly fatal. When malaria is considered in the differential diagnosis, an evalu- ation for malaria needs to be performed quickly, and the treatment approach usually depends on the laboratory test results. Treatment with gluco- corticoids was not indicated in this case.\n",

    "Diagnosis": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria.",
    "Key testing": "a rapid antigen test for malaria; microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Erik H. Klontz: At this hospital, the workup for malaria begins with a rapid antigen test. If the test is positive for malaria, microscopic examination of thick and thin blood smears is performed to con- firm the infection, identify the species, and quan- tify the level of parasitemia. A single negative rapid antigen test cannot rule out the diagnosis of malaria; repeating the test every 6 to 12 hours for up to 3 days is recommended if suspicion remains that the patient may have malaria.\nThe rapid antigen test performed at this hos- pital has two targets: the P. falciparum antigen and the panmalarial antigen, which is shared by all plasmodium species. This patient\u2019s rapid an- tigen test was positive for both the P. falciparum antigen, represented by the test 1 (T1) band, and the panmalarial antigen, represented by the test 2 (T2) band (Fig. 2A), findings that indicate in- fection with P. falciparum; however, coinfection with another plasmodium species could contrib- ute to the T2 band, so a mixed infection cannot be ruled out on the basis of this test result.\nThe intensity of the bands cannot be used to\nestimate the parasite burden, given that a very high parasitemia level can create a prozone ef- fect that weakens the band intensity.5 If an esti- mation of the parasitemia level is required before the results from analysis of the Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears are available, an examination of a thin peripheral-blood smear with Wright staining or Wright\u2013Giemsa staining can serve as a quick reference; however, follow-up examination with Giemsa staining, which offers better parasite visualization, should be performed. In this patient, Giemsa staining of a thin blood smear revealed intraerythrocytic ring forms with an extraordinarily high estimated parasitemia level of 36% (Fig. 2B). Ring forms (or immature trophozoites) are common to all plasmodium species; the ring forms of individual plasmodium species cannot be reliably distinguished from each other or from the ring forms of babesia species. The size of the infected red cells and the morphologic features (or notable absence of such features) of mature forms, including schizonts and gametocytes, can aid in identifying the species. With P. falciparum, banana-shaped gametocytes can be present, but mature schizonts are usually absent from the peripheral blood because they be come sequestered in postcapillary venules.6 Although gametocytes were not seen in this\npatient\u2019s blood smear, many ring forms had a \u201cheadphone\u201d appearance that is typical of P. falciparum (Fig. 2C). Rare maturing trophozoites producing the golden-brown malaria pigment (hemozoin, from parasite digestion of hemoglo- bin) were also visible in the blood smear, a find- ing that ruled out babesia infection (Fig. 2D). The combination of the characteristic trophozo- ite appearance, malaria pigment production, and the presence of a T1 band on a rapid antigen test confirms the diagnosis of P. falciparum malaria. At the same time, the notable absence of mature forms on multiple smears makes coinfection with another plasmodium species extremely unlikely.\n\nFigure 2. Malaria Test and Blood Smear.\nA rapid antigen test for malaria (Panel A) shows bands at the test 1 (T1) and test 2 (T2) lines, which could indicate a Plasmodium falciparum infection or a mixed infection including P. falciparum and another plasmodium species. Giemsa staining of a thin peripheral\u2011blood smear (Panel B) shows features consistent with P. falciparum. There are abundant intraerythrocytic ring forms that are small, thin, and delicate, with an estimated parasitemia level of 36%. Infected red cells are normal in size, and some are multiply infected. Mature forms, including schizonts and game\u2011 tocytes, are not seen. The right\u2011hand box in Panel B corresponds to Panel C, which shows a ring form with a \u201chead\u2011 phone\u201d appearance, with two pink dots of chromatin joined by a thin blue band of cytoplasm, a feature characteris\u2011 tic of P. falciparum. The left\u2011hand box in Panel B corresponds to Panel D, which shows a maturing trophozoite producing golden\u2011brown malaria pigment (arrow), a feature present in all plasmodium species but absent in babe\u2011 sia species.\n",
