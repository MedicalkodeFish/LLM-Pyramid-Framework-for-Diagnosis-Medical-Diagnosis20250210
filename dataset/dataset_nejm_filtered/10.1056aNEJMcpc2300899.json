    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Gregory M. Cote: A 52-year-old man with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor was admitted to this hospital because of recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until approximately 1.5 years before the current admission, when dysuria and pain in the lower abdomen and left leg developed after a motor vehicle accident. At another hospital, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reportedly revealed an incidental 14-cm  necrotic mass  in the pelvis, anterior to the bladder. Biopsy of the mass was reportedly diagnostic of a solitary fibrous tumor.\nThe patient was referred to the multidisciplinary oncology clinic of this hospi- tal. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed for staging, revealed two 9-mm nodules in the left lung. The patient was treated with a 3-month course of dacarbazine chemotherapy and concurrent radiation therapy targeting the pelvic mass, and then he underwent surgical resection of the pelvic tumor, including partial cystectomy and placement of a ureteral stent. Pathological examination of the resected specimen (Fig. 1) confirmed the diagnosis of spindle-cell sarcoma  with features consistent with a dedifferentiated solitary fibrous tumor. Immuno- histochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and CD34 in the tumor cells. Stereotactic radia- tion therapy for the lung nodules was also administered.\nHowever, metastatic disease progressed in the lungs, chest, bladder, and right leg. Over the subsequent 12-month period, the patient underwent serial treatment with four different chemotherapeutic regimens: pazopanib, doxorubicin with olaratumab, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and vinorelbine. Palliative radiation therapy for a painful leg metastasis was also provided.\nEleven days after the initiation of vinorelbine chemotherapy and 30 days before the current admission, the patient was admitted to this hospital with fever (tem- perature, 38.3\u00b0C), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 770 per microliter; refer- ence range, 1800 to 7700), and pneumonia in the left lower lobe.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: CT of the chest and abdomen (Fig. 2A), performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed known metastatic involvement of the lungs, bladder, retroperitoneum, perito- neum, skeletal muscles, and subcutaneous fat. There was no metastatic involvement of the ad- renal glands, pancreas, or liver.\nDr. Cote: Empirical treatment with cefepime was administered. Over the next several days, the neutropenia and fever resolved and the pneumo- nia abated. On the seventh hospital day, the pa- tient was discharged home with a follow-up visit scheduled in the oncology clinic. Eleven days after hospital discharge and 12 days before the current admission, the patient attended a scheduled outpatient visit for an infu- sion. He reported weakness and appeared con- fused. A fingerstick glucose level was 47 mg per deciliter (2.6 mmol per liter). Supplemental oral and intravenous glucose was administered, and his mental status improved, but fingerstick glu- cose levels remained below 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter). Review of fingerstick glucose measurements obtained during the patient\u2019s re- cent hospitalization showed multiple levels rang- ing from 50 to 60 mg per deciliter (2.8 to 3.3 mmol per liter).\nThe patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital for the management of hy- poglycemia. Laboratory test results from the sec- ond hospital admission are shown in Table 1. While the patient was in the hospital, he began to have diaphoresis that correlated with episodes of hypoglycemia, for which he received orange juice and dextrose. On evaluation by a dietitian, he was found to be meeting anticipated caloric requirements. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day; the blood glucose level was 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) before discharge.\nThree days later and 6 days before the current admission, the patient attended the scheduled follow-up visit in the oncology clinic. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with trabectedin was initiated, along with pegfilgras- tim and a 3-day tapering course of dexametha- sone. The day after the dexamethasone course was completed, the patient reported increased fatigue and cough. Two days later, he was admit- ted to the oncology unit because of weakness and diaphoresis; a fingerstick glucose level was 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter).\nOn the current admission, review of systems was notable for fatigue; pain associated with tumors involving the back, shoulders, and right leg; numbness of the right leg; the use of an indwelling Foley catheter for 2 months owing to urinary retention; dull chest pain and intermit- tent dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months; and constipation. The patient had no recent anorexia, weight change, fever, chills, orthopnea, hemoptysis, light-headedness, dizziness, palpita- tions, syncope, nausea, or vomiting.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for transfusion-dependent anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (for which he had received metformin, although not in the previous 6 months), hyper-tension, a colonic tubular adenoma, a renal cyst, osteoarthritis, chronic low-back pain, and depres- sion. He had undergone an appendectomy in the remote past. Medications included oral gabapen- tin, cyanocobalamin, tamsulosin, and finasteride; transdermal fentanyl; and oral acetaminophen, clonazepam, melatonin, polyethylene glycol, and oxycodone as needed. He had no access to insu- lin or other hypoglycemic medications. There were no known adverse drug reactions.\nThe patient had formerly worked as a laborer and had been receiving disability benefits since the motor vehicle accident. He had previously consumed six beers per week and smoked one pack of cigarettes per day, but he had stopped drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco 1 year earlier. There was no history of other substance use. His family history of cancer included mela- noma in his father, thyroid cancer in his sister, ovarian cancer in his maternal grandmother, leukemia in his maternal aunt, and sarcoma in his paternal uncle. His mother had hypertension and dyslipidemia, and a brother had diabetes. The patient had an adult child, who was healthy. The tympanic temperature was 37.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 148/87 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Multiple tender, palpable masses were present, including masses on the left shoulder, neck, and left upper leg. A venous-access port was in place in the chest wall on the right side. The abdomi- nal incision was well healed. A Foley catheter was in place, and there was pink-tinged urine. A faint rash was present on the lower abdomen at the site of previous radiation therapy. Edema was present in both legs. Laboratory test results from the current hospital admission are shown\nin Table 1.\nDr. Goiffon: A chest radiograph (Fig. 2B) showed abundant metastatic pulmonary  nodules. CT of the chest (Fig. 2C and 2D), performed af- ter the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed that the  nodules had increased in size and quantity over a period of 1 month. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Dr. Cote: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, a leftward axis, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes, and intraventricular con-\nduction delay.\nOn the first hospital day, although the patient was receiving a continuous infusion of dextrose, five bolus injections of dextrose and six glasses of orange juice were needed to increase the blood glucose level to more than 100 mg per deciliter (5.6 mmol per liter). On the morning of the second hospital day, the blood glucose level was 42 mg per deciliter (2.3 mmol per liter). Treatment with oral prednisone was initiated.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page).

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Tara E. Soumerai: This 52-year-old man with a solitary fibrous tumor that had  metastasized  to the lungs, chest, bladder, legs,  and  retroperito- neum presented with recurrent and refractory hypoglycemia. He had undergone extensive treat- ment with several  chemotherapeutic  regimens and radiation therapy, in addition to pelvic tumor resection. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, but  he had not received metformin for  6 months before the current admission. Imaging studies showed evidence of widely metastatic cancer, but  there was no metastatic involvement  of the adrenal glands, pancreas, or liver.\n\nSoft-Tissue Sarcoma\nBefore I construct a differential diagnosis for this patient\u2019s hypoglycemic syndrome, I will review the epidemiology of soft-tissue sarcoma in adults, particularly solitary fibrous tumors. Sarcoma is a term that encompasses any cancer that arises from connective tissue, including bone, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, tendons, fat, and other structures. Thus, sarcoma can arise from essen- tially any organ in the body. The arms and legs are the most common sites in adults, followed by the thorax and abdomen.1 Liposarcoma is the most common type of soft-tissue sarcoma in adults, followed by leiomyosarcoma, undifferen- tiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and gastrointesti- nal stromal tumors.2 Sarcoma is very rare, with 4 cases per 100,000 persons diagnosed in the United States each year.3 As with most cancers, the initial workup for suspected soft-tissue sar- coma includes staging imaging \u2014 typically MRI of the affected body part for surgical planning, as well as CT of the chest, with or without CT of the abdomen and pelvis, for ruling out distant metastases.4 Biopsy is subsequently performed. The cornerstone of treatment for nonmetastatic sarcoma is surgical resection. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both may be included before or after surgery, depending on the clinical features.5\n\nSolitary Fibrous Tumors\nSolitary fibrous tumors are exceedingly rare, ac- counting for 3.7% of all cases of soft-tissue sarcoma, with an incidence of 0.35 cases per 100,000 persons per year.6 Such tumors can  arise in the serous membranes, the dura of the meninges, and the deep soft tissues. Approxi- mately 30% of cases arise in the pleura, 30% in the abdomen (including the peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and pelvis), 20% in the head and neck (including the meninges), and 20% in other  sites (bone or deep soft tissues of the trunk, arms, or legs).7 Patients with solitary fibrous tu- mors most commonly present with a palpable mass. The tumors harbor a characteristic genetic defect, inversion of the long arm of chromosome 12 (12q13), which results in fusion of NAB2 (the gene that encodes next-generation fronthaul interface 1A\u2013binding protein 2) and STAT6 (the gene that encodes STAT6).8-10 The growth pat- tern of solitary fibrous tumors varies widely, ranging from indolent to highly aggressive.\nAs an inpatient oncologist, when I evaluate a patient with metastatic cancer who presents with a complex medical problem such as hypoglyce- mia, I first try to determine whether the prob- lem is caused by the cancer. In most cases, I find that the reason for the patient\u2019s hospitalization is related to the cancer, even if it might not seem that way at first. The possible cancer-related causes of this patient\u2019s recurrent hypoglycemia include an insulin-secreting tumor, a high meta- bolic rate with glucose consumption by the tu- mor, a side effect of therapy, or a paraneoplastic syndrome. The possible non\u2013cancer-related causes are limited to surreptitious insulin use or sepsis. Sepsis might even be categorized as a cancer-related cause, given that patients with cancer are at an increased risk for severe infec- tion due to neutropenia related to cytotoxic chemotherapy.\n\nSurreptitious Insulin Use or Sepsis\nThe key to determining the diagnosis in this case is to focus on the additional laboratory values obtained during the patient\u2019s second hospital admission, namely the insulin level (<0.2 \u03bcIU per milliliter), C-peptide level (<0.1 ng per milliliter), and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate level (<0.1 mmol per liter). The two possible non\u2013 cancer-related causes can be ruled out first. The patient had an undetectable insulin level, which rules out surreptitious insulin use. In addition, at the time of the current admission, he appeared well and had normal vital signs, a normal leuko- cyte count, and a normal lactate level (0.9 mmol per liter), findings that rule out sepsis as the cause of his hypoglycemia.\n\nInsulin-Secreting Tumor\nSeveral cancer-related causes could explain this patient\u2019s hypoglycemia. An insulin-secreting tu- mor would result in a high insulin level, as well as a high C-peptide level.11 As such, the C-pep- tide level can be used to differentiate an insulin- secreting tumor from exogenous insulin use. Both the insulin level and the C-peptide level were undetectable in this patient, so we can rule out insulinoma.\n\nGlucose Consumption by the Tumor\nGlucose consumption by a highly active tumor is an exceedingly rare phenomenon \u2014 essentially  a spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome in a patient with a solid tumor. If this patient had a high metabolic rate with glucose consumption by the tumor, I would expect additional electrolyte dis- turbances to be present. The potassium and phosphorus levels would be high, and the calci- um level would be low. The normal levels in this patient make this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nSide Effect of Therapy\nThe use of glucocorticoids can lead to adrenal insufficiency. This patient had normal results on a cosyntropin stimulation test, a finding that rules out adrenal insufficiency. In addition, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors can lead to the  development  of  anti-insulin  antibodies. He did not have exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which rules out an immune-mediated adverse effect. Furthermore, if he had anti-insu- lin antibodies, I would expect the insulin level to be very high, and it was not.12\n\nParaneoplastic Syndrome\nOncologists consider the diagnosis of paraneo- plastic syndrome in patients with cancer who have something going on that is difficult to ex- plain. Some paraneoplastic syndromes are rela- tively common, such as the Lambert\u2013Eaton syndrome in patients with small-cell lung cancer,13,14 whereas other paraneoplastic syndromes are rare. I suspect that this patient had one of these unusual syndromes.\nThe characteristic genetic defect of solitary fibrous tumors is a chromosomal inversion that results in the NAB2\u2013STAT6 fusion gene. This fu- sion involves a constitutively activated version of NAB2, which drives tumorigenesis. In addition, the chimeric transcription factor produced by NAB2\u2013STAT6 causes dysregulation of several tar- get genes, including IGF2, the gene that encodes insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II).8,15 Dysreg- ulation of IGF2 leads to excess production of IGF-II from the tumor, which can result in hypo- glycemia.\nIn an article by Karl Walter Doege and Roy Pilling Potter that was published in the Annals  of Surgery in 1930, the phenomenon of refrac- tory hypoglycemia in a patient with \u201cfibro-sarco- ma\u201d of the mediastinum was described for the first time.16 This phenomenon has since been named the Doege\u2013Potter syndrome and is known to be caused by tumor secretion of IGF-II. The Doege\u2013Potter syndrome occurs in less than 5% of patients with solitary fibrous tumors, primar- ily with large peritoneal or pleural tumors.\nIf we refer once more to the patient\u2019s labora- tory values, he had low levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (a serum ke- tone). In the context of the Doege\u2013Potter syn- drome, these values would correlate with an in- crease in the free IGF-II level and an increased ratio of IGF-II to IGF-I. To establish the diagno- sis of the Doege\u2013Potter syndrome in this case,  I would obtain the IGF-II level or the ratio of IGF-II to IGF-I.\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Hypoglycemia due to excess production of insulin-like growth factor II from a solid tumor (Doege\u2013Potter syndrome).",
    "Diagnosis": "Doege\u2013Potter syndrome",
    "Key testing": "competitive binding immuno- assay; glucose level",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Albert L. Sy: Diagnostic testing was performed with the use of a competitive binding immuno- assay.22 The patient had an IGF-II level of 354 ng per milliliter (reference range, 333 to 967),  an IGF-I level of 23 ng per milliliter (reference range, 50 to 317), and a glucose level of 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]). In the context of paraneoplastic  produc- tion of IGF-II, the ratio of IGF-II to IGF-I is the diagnostic marker of choice because  the  abso- lute IGF-II level is frequently normal.23 A ratio of more than 3:1 is suggestive of tumor-mediated production of IGF-II, and a ratio of more than 10:1 is considered to  be  diagnostic.24  This  pa- tient had a ratio of 15.4:1. The combination of a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor, hypoglycemia, and an IGF-II:IGF-I ratio of 15.4:1 is consistent with a diagnosis of the Doege\u2013Potter syndrome. Diagnostic testing for the Doege\u2013Potter syn- drome may include measurement of the pro-IGF- II level. Molecular testing for confirmation of a NAB2\u2013STAT6 fusion gene may be performed but is not required; a positive immunohistochemical\nstain for STAT6 confirms the diagnosis.\n",
