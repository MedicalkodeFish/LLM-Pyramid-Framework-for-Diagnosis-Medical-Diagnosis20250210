    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Gabrielle K. Bromberg: A 76-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, memory impairment, and suicidal ideation.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 2 months before this admission, when she began having epigastric pain and anorexia associated with new constipation. Findings on upper and lower endoscopy were reportedly normal, as were the results of serologic testing for celiac disease.\nFifteen days before this admission, the abdominal pain worsened. Ten days before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hospital because of diffuse abdominal pain associated with nausea and poor oral intake. On examina- tion, the patient appeared pale. The abdomen was soft and nontender. The patient was alert and oriented to time, place, and person but had difficulty with word finding. Initial laboratory test results were notable for normocytic anemia and an elevated bilirubin level; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ryan Chung: On admission to the other hospital, computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1A and 1B) was performed after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material. There was evidence of a previous cholecys- tectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter (reference range, <10 mm after cholecystectomy), and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. On magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Fig. 1C and 1D), the common bile duct again measured 7 mm in diameter; findings were otherwise normal.\nDr. Bromberg: After admission to the other hospital, 1 unit of packed red cells was transfused, and the hemoglobin level remained stable thereafter. On the third hospital day, the patient could eat small amounts of food. On further questioning, the patient expressed suicidal ideation and reported a history of prolonged domes- tic abuse; she was evaluated by the psychiatry service. A diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder was made, and lorazepam was administered. The suicidal ideation resolved, but she was noted to need substantial assistance with self-care. While plans were being made for the patient\u2019s discharge to an assisted- living facility, the constipation worsened, and her oral intake decreased. On the seventh hospi- tal day, vomiting developed, and the laboratory evaluation was notable for hyponatremia, with a blood sodium level of 120 mmol per liter (refer- ence range, 135 to 145). A nasogastric tube was placed, and 3% hypertonic saline was adminis- tered intravenously. On the eighth day at the other hospital, additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Chung: Repeat CT of the abdomen and pel-\nvis (Fig. 1E and 1F), performed after the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple dilated, fluid-filled loops of small bowel that measured up to 4 cm in diameter and the presence of air\u2013fluid levels and an abrupt transi- tion point in the right lower quadrant.\nDr. Bromberg: Urine specimens had been sent for measurement of urinary porphyrin levels at the time of admission to the other hospital; the resulting levels were elevated (Table 1), and the patient was transferred to this hospital for fur- ther evaluation.\nOn admission to this hospital, the patient reported persistent abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. The vomiting had resolved after insertion of the nasogastric tube. She reported weight loss of 18 kg over the course of the previ- ous 4 months while she was following a limited diet. In an effort to improve the patient\u2019s overall health, the patient\u2019s daughter had provided her with supplements and recommended a ketogenic diet consisting of protein and cooked vegetables. The patient also reported that she had been hav- ing difficulty with memory for 2 months before this admission.\nThe patient had a history of type 2 diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, and glaucoma. Her sur- gical history included remote cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Medications included panto- prazole, ondansetron, and calcium carbonate in combination with cholecalciferol. The patient was allergic to ampicillin, penicillin, trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, tetracycline, eryth- romycin, nitrofurantoin, and nortriptyline \u2014 all with unknown reactions. She lived with her sis- ter in suburban New England and reported that she was recently separated from her husband owing to long-standing domestic abuse. The patient had two children. She did not have con- tact with her son, and her daughter lived in India but visited regularly. Her mother had died from breast cancer. Her father and son both had bipo- lar affective disorder. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the blood pressure 125/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 18.5. The patient appeared cachec- tic. There was a nasogastric tube in place. The conjunctivae were pale. The abdomen was soft and diffusely tender, without guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. There was no rash. The patient was alert but inconsistently oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was tangen- tial, and she was unable to recite days of the week backward. The remainder of the examina- tion was normal.\nThe hemoglobin level was 9.1 g per deciliter\n(reference range, 12.0 to 16.0). Additional labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A periph- eral-blood smear showed normochromic red cells with occasional burr cells and no schistocytes. Reticulocytes, basophilic stippling, and rare nu- cleated red cells were present; there were no blasts, and the white cells were morphologically normal.\nDr. Chung: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma (Fig. 2). The common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter.\nDr. Bromberg: Intravenous fluids and hemin were administered. On the third hospital day, the volume of output from the nasogastric tube remained elevated. The patient underwent surgi- cal exploration for possible small-bowel obstruc- tion. Dilated loops of small bowel with a transi- tion point near the terminal ileum were observed; there was a loop of small bowel tethered under- neath an adhesion band around which the ce- cum had volvulized. The adhesion was lysed, and the loop of small bowel released. There was no mass or stricture.\n\nTable 1.

Initial Imaging Studies of the Abdomen and Pelvis, Other Hospital.\nAt the time of admission to the other hospital, coronal (Panel A) and axial (Panel B) images from CT of the ab\u2011 domen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, were obtained. Surgi\u2011 cal clips related to a previous cholecystectomy are visi\u2011 ble (black arrow), and the common bile duct measures 7 mm in diameter, with smooth distal tapering to the ampulla (white arrowheads). Small\u2011bowel loops of nor\u2011 mal caliber are seen throughout the abdomen (white arrows). There is mesenteric edema (black arrowhead) and anasarca (not shown). One day after the initial CT scan, coronal (Panel C) and axial (Panel D) T2\u2011weight\u2011 ed images from magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea\u2011 tography, performed without the administration of in\u2011 travenous contrast material, were obtained. The common bile duct again measures 7 mm in diameter (arrow\u2011 heads), without choledocholithiasis. A 1.9\u2011cm simple cyst is seen in the left kidney (arrow). Eight days after the initial CT scan, coronal (Panel E) and axial (Panel F) images from CT of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate\u2011 rial, were obtained. There are new dilated, fluid\u2011filled loops of small bowel that are not seen on the initial CT scan; the loops measure up to 4 cm in diameter, with an abrupt transition point in the right lower quadrant (arrows).\n\nFigure 2. Additional Imaging Studies of the Abdomen, This Hospital.\nUltrasonography of the right upper quadrant was per\u2011 formed on day 2 at this hospital. A grayscale ultrasound image of the right hepatic lobe (Panel A) shows mildly increased echogenicity and mild coarsening of the liver parenchyma. On a color Doppler image of the hepatic hilum (Panel B, calipers), the common bile duct mea\u2011 sures 5 mm in diameter.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Lisa L. Willett: This 76-year-old woman had an extensive evaluation with a prolonged hospital stay for chronic progressive gastrointestinal symp- toms of generalized abdominal pain, constipa- tion, and weight loss. She also had chronic neurologic symptoms with cognitive decline and memory impairment, as well as suicidal ideation. In addition, she was found to have elevated uri- nary porphyrin levels. The constellation of her symptoms prompts evaluation for acute por- phyria.\n\nPorphyria\nPorphyria refers to a group of metabolic disor- ders that involve the heme biosynthetic pathway. Eighty percent of heme is produced in the bone marrow, where it combines with globin to form erythroid cells. The remainder of heme is pro- duced in the liver and in cells outside the liver to make cytochrome P450 enzymes and other pro- teins.1,2\nHeme synthesis begins in the mitochondria with succinyl\u2013coenzyme A and glycine. It involves eight steps, each with a unique enzyme that advances the precursor products along the path- way. The enzyme that initiates the synthesis path- way, delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS), differs in the liver (ALAS1) and bone marrow (ALAS2), as does the regulatory feedback con- trol. Disruptions in the pathway resulting from enzyme deficiencies cause precursors to accu- mulate.1,2\nThe accumulation of porphyrin precursors (delta-aminolevulinic acid [ALA] or porphobi- linogen [PBG]) or porphyrins (i.e., uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, or protoporphyrin) leads to the clinical features of porphyria.3 Accumulation of the porphyrin precursors causes damage to neu- rons in the gut, brain, and peripheral nervous system; accumulation of porphyrins causes photosensitivity and damage to skin. The specific enzyme deficiency and the corresponding accu- mulation of precursors lead to the differing pat- terns of disease in porphyria (Fig. 3).\nPorphyria can be categorized as either acute hepatic (neurovisceral) or cutaneous. The four acute hepatic porphyrias are acute intermittent porphyria, variegate porphyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and ALA dehydratase\u2013deficiency porphyria. Two of these, variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria, have both acute neu- rovisceral features and cutaneous features.1 This patient had gastrointestinal and neurologic symp- toms; therefore, acute intermittent porphyria must be considered.\n\nAcute Intermittent Porphyria\nAcute intermittent porphyria is one of the more common types of porphyria.4 It is caused by a partial deficiency in the third enzyme of heme synthesis, PBG deaminase. Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder, although it has a low penetrance; less than 10% of persons with a pathogenic mutation have symptoms.5 The classic presentation of acute intermittent porphyria occurs in young women, with symptoms of fatigue, difficulty concentrat- ing, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Persons with acute intermittent porphyria can have hypertension, tachycardia, and subtle neu- rologic signs with an otherwise normal physical examination. Abdominal pain is typically out of proportion to the examination findings, often resulting in a delay in the diagnosis. Common laboratory findings in patients with acute inter- mittent porphyria include hyponatremia and mild elevations in liver-enzyme levels. Imaging studies may show an ileus. The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria is established on the basis of elevated levels of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors, specifically PBG, in the urine. Elevated levels of ALA and porphyrins are not specific to porphyria; acute hepatic por- phyria is diagnosed by substantial elevations in the urinary PBG level. Genetic testing can be useful for confirmation and to establish the type of acute hepatic porphyria. Attacks of acute in- termittent porphyria can be precipitated by pro- gesterone surges associated with menses, caloric deprivation, or medications.\nThis patient had reduced oral intake (initially related to dieting and later to anorexia and nausea), which could have led to caloric deprivation. Her liver-enzyme levels were initially elevated at the other hospital, and hyponatremia was part of her presentation. Although she had some fea- tures of acute intermittent porphyria, her older age, the chronicity of the abdominal pain, and the presence of anemia are not consistent with acute intermittent porphyria and prompt me to seek an alternative diagnosis.\n\nNutritional Deficiencies\nAfter learning about the patient\u2019s diet, I can ex- pand the differential diagnosis beyond porphyria and consider nutritional deficiencies and side effects of macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are major dietary chemical com- pounds that are needed in large quantities in the body; they include carbohydrates, protein, and fats. Micronutrients refer to vitamins and miner- als, which the body needs in small quantities.\nThis patient had been following a ketogenic diet for months; such a diet could cause both macronutrient and micronutrient deficiency. A ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that aims to induce ketone production through fat metabolism. The ketogenic diet is being studied as a therapy for many medical illnesses.6 Historically, the diet has been used to treat epilepsy, and studies are underway to evaluate its use in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple cancers, cardiovascular disease, diabe- tes, and obesity. A reported side effect of a keto- genic diet is diarrhea, which this patient did not have. The constellation of this patient\u2019s signs and symptoms would not be explained by a keto- genic diet, and I am reassured that a nutritional deficiency is not the cause of her illness.\n\nAnemia and Erythropoiesis\nThis patient had normocytic anemia, an elevated reticulocyte count, and abnormal findings on a peripheral-blood smear, with nucleated red cells and basophilic stippling. Reticulocytosis is the physiologic response to anemia; the production of nucleated red cells and the presence of baso- philic stippling are not.7 Nuclear extrusion is the last step before a normoblast enters the circula- tion to become a reticulocyte. The presence of nucleated red cells on the peripheral-blood smear suggests an abnormality in the bone mar- row or in red-cell production. Basophilic stip- pling is caused by abnormal aggregates of ribo- somes and polyribosomes in reticulocytes. Basophilic stippling occurs when hemoglobin synthesis is impaired, usually in the context of thalassemia (impaired globin synthesis) or lead poisoning (impaired heme synthesis). The pres- ence of basophilic stippling is probably a major clue in this case.\nLead Poisoning\nDecades ago, lead poisoning was a major public health threat that led to national efforts to pro- tect the public.8 Exposure to lead most com- monly occurs through occupational exposures associated with the removal of old paint, demo- lition of buildings, metal mining, or battery manufacturing. In children, accidental ingestion of lead-containing paint causes devastating neu- rologic consequences. With heightened occupa- tional awareness and preventive measures, lead poisoning is now less common. However, there are many case reports of inadvertent exposure to lead from a variety of sources, such as lead pipes, cookware, dishes, cosmetics, retained bullets, \u201cmoonshine\u201d liquor, and herbal supple- ments. Recently, lead has been found in opium that was sold in the Middle East.9 It is also found in Ayurvedic medicines.\n \nAyurveda is a form of traditional Indian medicine that is used by 80% of India\u2019s popula- tion and has had increasing popularity in the United States. Rasa shastra is the ancient prac- tice of adding metals, such as lead, arsenic, and mercury, to herbal medicines. Twenty percent of Ayurvedic medicines manufactured in the United States and India contain lead, arsenic, and mer- cury.10 Patients may be reluctant to disclose that they are taking these medicines or may not real- ize that it is relevant medical history. Physicians need to be aware that Ayurvedic medicines, as well as traditional medicines from other cul- tures, may be a source of heavy-metal poisoning. Lead poisoning causes a range of nonspecific symptoms, depending on the blood lead level. Adults with blood lead levels between 30 and 50 \u03bcg per deciliter can have mild symptoms, including fatigue, irritability, and headache. More severe symptoms are seen with high lead levels (>70 \u03bcg per deciliter) and can include ane- mia, constipation, colicky abdominal pain, and peripheral neuropathy; if the level is higher than 100 \u03bcg per deciliter, cerebral edema, encepha- lopathy, coma, or death can occur. Examination findings are typically nonspecific. Long-term lead exposure may cause Burton\u2019s lines on gums, cognitive impairment, and motor weakness in the arms and legs. Common laboratory abnor- malities include normocytic or microcytic ane- mia, basophilic stippling, and abnormalities in\nkidney or liver function.\nLead poisoning should be considered in any patient presenting with signs and symptoms of porphyria.1,2,11 Lead poisoning has been thought to affect several enzymes of heme synthesis, with the primary site of inhibition being ALA dehy- dratase (Fig. 3).2,12 It mimics the clinical presen- tation of acute intermittent porphyria with ab- normal urinary porphyrin levels, as seen in this patient. Lead poisoning could explain the pa- tient\u2019s chronic gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms, the absence of focal examination findings, and the presence of anemia with baso- philic stippling. The dilated loops of small bowel were later explained by adhesions result- ing from previous surgeries. The patient\u2019s daugh- ter visited from India frequently and had pro- vided supplements to the patient in an effort to improve her health. I suspect that this patient had lead poisoning from ingestion of Ayurvedic medicines and that the diagnostic test was for a blood lead level.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Amy K. Dickey: The urinary porphyrin levels, which were measured at the other hospital, were elevated; the coproporphyrin levels were particu- larly elevated. Increased coproporphyrin levels can be associated with porphyria but also with other medical conditions, such as heavy-metal poisoning and liver disease, and with certain medications.13-17 For many of these causes, the specific porphyrins that are elevated and the degree and mechanism of elevation have not been systematically studied. However, a substan- tial elevation in the urinary PBG level is specific for the three most common acute hepatic por- phyrias.2 ALA (an amino acid) and PBG (a pyr- role) are the first two intermediates in the heme biosynthetic pathway, and both accumulate dur- ing attacks of these porphyrias.18 They are not porphyrins, which are tetrapyrroles, and they are not typically included in a urine porphyrin panel.18 Measurement of the urinary PBG and total porphyrin levels during an acute attack, with the results normalized per gram of urine creatinine, is recommended for screening for acute hepatic porphyrias, and such testing will detect all four acute hepatic porphyrias.18\nThis patient was initially treated with intrave-\nnous hemin for an acute hepatic porphyria be- cause of reported elevations in the levels of both ALA and PBG. The patient\u2019s urinary PBG level was measured at a reference laboratory with the use of a highly sensitive method that provides a low upper limit of the reference range; the level was consequently reported as elevated, at 14.7 \u03bcmol per liter (reference value, <1.3). However, after normalizing the value to the creati- nine level measured in the same sample and comparing the value to a more typical upper limit, the urinary PBG level was in fact normal, at 3.3 mg per gram of creatinine (reference val- ue, <4.0). In contrast, the urinary ALA level was very elevated, at 83.7 mg per gram of creatinine (reference value, <7.0).19\nDuring attacks of acute intermittent por- phyria, hereditary coproporphyria, and variegate porphyria, the urinary PBG level is expected to be elevated, at 20 to 300 mg per gram of creatinine, accompanied by elevations in the levels of ALA (typically approximately half the PBG level when expressed in mg per gram of creatinine) and total urinary porphyrin.4 An elevation in the ALA level but not the PBG level, as was the case in this patient, suggests ALA dehydratase deficiency, which is associated with ALA dehydra- tase\u2013deficiency porphyria (an extremely rare disease), lead poisoning, and hereditary tyrosin- emia.20,21 Marked elevations in the levels of uri- nary coproporphyrin and erythrocyte zinc proto- porphyrin are also associated with these conditions.20 ALA dehydratase inhibition can fully explain the elevations in the levels of uri- nary ALA, coproporphyrin, and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin that are seen in persons with lead poisoning.17\nThis patient\u2019s blood lead level was markedly increased, at 104 \u03bcg per deciliter (reference val- ue, <4.9), which confirmed a diagnosis of lead poisoning. The erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin level was also elevated.22\nIn the diagnosis of rare diseases, two op- posite pitfalls are common. The first is not considering the rare disease as a possible diag- nosis. For porphyria and lead poisoning, a low threshold for testing is important. The second pitfall is committing to a diagnosis of a rare disease too quickly, as occurred in this case. Misdiagnosis of an acute hepatic porphyria oc- curs in some patients with abdominal pain and nonspecific laboratory findings, such as report- ed elevations in urinary ALA and porphyrin levels. This case highlights the importance of performing confirmatory testing, consulting with experts, and being willing to investigate alter- native diagnoses.\n",
