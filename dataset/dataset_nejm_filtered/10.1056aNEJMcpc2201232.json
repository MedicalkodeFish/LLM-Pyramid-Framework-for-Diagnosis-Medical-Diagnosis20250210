    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Leontios Pappas (Medicine): An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral- blood smear.\nSix weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after 4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had grad- ually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was 38.9\u00b0C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney- function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Fig. 1).\nDr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastro- duodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.\nDuring the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of con- cerns about a possible tickborne illness.\nOn hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation de- creased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intrave- nous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intra- venous furosemide was provided.\nOn hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancyto-\npenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral- blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs\u2019 tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver- function tests. The results of serologic tests for\n \nEpstein\u2013Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance.\nA tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible throm- botic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia.\nOn hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocar- diogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care.\nOn evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since re- solved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history in- cluded hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure.\nOne year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyper- chromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. There- after, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nMedications  included  amlodipine, atorvastatin,\nand hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occa- sionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The pa- tient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nExamination of a peripheral-blood smear\nrevealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Fig. 2). The results of serum protein elec- trophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were in- creased, with a normal ratio. Screening for hu- man immunodeficiency virus infection was nega- tive. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were nor- mal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoem- bryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge. Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Rebecca K. Leaf: This 80-year-old woman, in whom anemia and thrombocytopenia had been detected 1 year earlier, was admitted to another hospital with a 5-week history of fatigue and weight loss. She was found to have pancytopenia as well as schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear. Plasma exchange was initiated for a pre- sumed diagnosis of TTP. When evaluating a pa- tient with a complex condition who has already undergone an extensive evaluation and begun treatment for a presumptive diagnosis, there is a risk of anchoring bias.1 Therefore, I will take a step back and reassess all the details of the case, making sure not to overprioritize data that sup- port the initial diagnosis.\n\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nThis patient was initially thought to have TTP, a thrombotic microangiopathy associated with a mortality as high as 90% if untreated.2 Patients with TTP present with severe thrombocytopenia, Coombs-negative intravascular hemolytic anemia, and end-organ dysfunction due to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in small vessels.\nTTP was first described in 1924 by Dr. Eli Moschcowitz, who wrote that the condition was due to \u201csome powerful poison . . . [with] both agglutinative and hemolytic properties.\u201d3 In 1982, the pathophysiological basis of TTP was deter- mined to be a defect in the breakdown of ultra- large von Willebrand factor multimers,4 and by 2001, the enzyme responsible for cleaving these large von Willebrand factor molecules was dis- covered to be ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 re- peats, member 13).5 The clinical manifestations of TTP result from reduced ADAMTS13 activity, which leads to decreased cleavage of von Wille- brand factor and to vigorous adherence of platelets to von Willebrand factor multimers by means of the glycoprotein Ib receptor expressed on the platelet surface.6,7\nSchistocytes, which result from shearing of red cells through fibrin strands in the microvas- culature, are a quintessential, but not pathogno- monic, finding in patients with TTP. Prompt recognition of TTP is critical, and clinical deci- sion-making tools such as the PLASMIC score6 can be useful while the results of confirmatory testing for ADAMTS13 activity levels are pend- ing. The standard of care, which includes plasma exchange and treatment with high-dose gluco- corticoids, can be lifesaving and thus should be initiated without delay when there is a high clinical suspicion for TTP.7,8\nHowever, several features of this patient\u2019s\npresentation are not consistent with TTP. With TTP, I would expect the blood haptoglobin level to be low or even undetectable, and it was ele- vated in this patient. In addition, I would expect an elevated blood level of indirect bilirubin and an elevated reticulocyte index, findings consis- tent with peripheral red-cell destruction. This patient\u2019s blood level of indirect bilirubin was normal, and the reticulocyte index (calculated by multiplying the reticulocyte count by the hema- tocrit and then dividing the product by a normal hematocrit) was 0.65, a result indicative of a hypoproliferative rather than a peripheral de- structive process. Furthermore, this patient had pancytopenia, which is not a characteristic fea- ture of TTP. Despite the identification of schisto- cytes on a peripheral-blood smear, I suspect that there is an alternative explanation for this pa- tient\u2019s symptoms and laboratory findings. My next step in working toward the most likely diagnosis is to examine possible causes of her pancytopenia.\nPancytopenia\nThe differential diagnosis for pancytopenia is broad, and it can be helpful to break it down into categories.\n\nSystemic Diseases\nSystemic diseases that lead to increased circulat- ing levels of inflammatory cytokines and hor- mones (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis fac- tor \u03b1, and hepcidin) can cause bone marrow suppression. However, this patient had no his- tory of a systemic disease, such as an autoim-\n \nmune disorder or chronic infection, that would cause decreased production of blood cells. Al- though this patient had a candida infection when she presented to the other hospital, I suspect that this was a consequence of her low white-cell count, rather than the cause of it.\n\nMedications and Toxins\nExposure to a medication or toxin with myelo- suppressive properties can lead to low blood counts. This patient was taking amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide; none of these medications are typically associated with pancytopenia. Excessive alcohol consumption can cause pancytopenia, but the patient drank alcohol only occasionally. Illicit drugs can con- tain adulterants that cause cytopenias (e.g., leva- misole in cocaine), but this patient had no his- tory of illicit drug use. She worked as a cleaner and was likely to have occupational exposure to toxins or chemicals. It is difficult to know what effect, if any, that this exposure had on her pre- sentation.\n\nPeripheral Destruction or Sequestration of Blood Cells Peripheral destruction or sequestration of blood cells can lead to pancytopenia. However, there is no clear laboratory evidence of red-cell destruc- tion. Immune thrombocytopenia and autoim- mune neutropenia can cause isolated low plate- let and neutrophil counts, respectively, but neither of these disorders would explain a low count in all three cell lines. Splenomegaly can lead to leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, but this patient\u2019s spleen was not enlarged and spleno- megaly would not explain the anemia.\n\nNutritional Disorders\nNutritional deficiencies can result in impaired production of blood cells. Vitamin B12 and folate are required for DNA synthesis, and deficiency in these nutrients causes cells to arrest in the S phase (synthesis phase) of the cell cycle.9 Pa- tients with severe vitamin B12 or folate deficiency can present with megaloblastosis (nuclear\u2013cyto- plasmic asynchrony), pancytopenia, and an ele- vated lactate dehydrogenase level; in fact, the clinical features can mimic those of acute myeloid leukemia.10,11\nCopper is an important nutrient that plays a critical role in the formation of blood cells. Copper deficiency should be considered in the evalu- ation of patients with pancytopenia, especially those with a history of bariatric surgery, inflam- matory bowel disease, or use of zinc supple- ments.12 The blood levels of vitamin B12, folate, and copper were normal in this patient, and al- though she reported that she had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period, I would not expect her current nutritional state to explain her low blood counts.\n\nMyelophthisis\nMyelophthisis is the infiltration of bone marrow by nonhematopoietic cells, which leads to the disruption of normal hematopoiesis or the de- velopment of bone marrow fibrosis. Causes of myelophthisis include solid tumors with metas- tasis to the bone marrow, granulomatous and lipid storage disorders, and primary myelofibro- sis. This patient had an extensive family history of cancer, including early-onset breast cancer in her sister. In addition, she presented with dys- phagia, weight loss, and bilateral pelvic masses. A diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer should be considered; a pathogenic germline mutation in the CDH1 tumor suppressor gene (encoding E-cadherin) could manifest as diffuse gastric cancer in this patient and as breast can- cer in her sister.13 Carcinomatous infiltration of the bone marrow could explain the patient\u2019s pancytopenia, and the bilateral pelvic masses could be Krukenberg tumors of the ovaries. However, the patient did not have evidence of gastric abnormalities on endoscopic evaluation, an elevated blood level of carcinoembryonic an- tigen on laboratory testing, findings suggestive of metastatic disease on imaging, or findings consistent with the leukoerythroblastic picture typically seen in patients with myelophthisis on examination of a peripheral-blood smear. There- fore, an infiltrative bone marrow process is un- likely.\nAplastic Anemia\nAplastic anemia is a general term that refers to an \u201cempty bone marrow,\u201d which can be caused by autoimmune diseases, toxins, infections, or inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. It is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow, with an absence of early myeloid forms. Al- though cytogenetic aberrations can be found\n \n\nwith both congenital and acquired forms of aplastic anemia, only a few genes are typically affected, and the breadth of molecular muta- tions is less extensive than the long list of driver mutations characteristic of myelodysplastic syn- drome (MDS).14\nDo the results of this patient\u2019s previous bone marrow biopsy, performed 1 year before this presentation, help in evaluating the possibility of aplastic anemia? The bone marrow was not hypocellular; in fact, it was hyperplastic and had evidence of dysplasia and multiple cytogenetic abnormalities. This constellation of findings would be highly unusual for aplastic anemia.\nTherefore, I would reframe this patient\u2019s case as an 80-year-old woman with a history of pan- cytopenia and hyperplastic and dysplastic bone marrow who presented with worsening cytope- nias and with abnormal cells on a peripheral- blood smear, findings suggestive of MDS.\n\nMyelodysplastic Syndrome\nMDS is a primary myeloid neoplasm character- ized by peripheral-blood cytopenias, dysplasia of the bone marrow, clonal proliferation of hema- topoietic stem cells, recurrent acquired molecu- lar abnormalities, and a risk of transformation to acute leukemia.15,16 The importance of recur- rent molecular driver mutations in the pathogen- esis of MDS has become increasingly recog- nized. These clonal signatures are important for risk stratification, and they can also help to guide clinical care (e.g., predicting the response to targeted therapy). This patient\u2019s previous bone marrow biopsy, performed 1 year earlier, most likely provided evidence of MDS, and her current presentation probably reflects disease evolution manifested by worsening cytopenias. A bone marrow biopsy should be performed to defini- tively rule out progression of MDS or transfor- mation to acute leukemia.\nSchistocytes\nWould a diagnosis of MDS explain the schisto- cytes that were identified on this patient\u2019s periph- eral-blood smear? Schistocytes are typically associated with microangiopathic destruction, which is characteristic of TTP, complement- mediated hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome, and dis- seminated intravascular coagulation. However, the finding of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear is not specific. For instance, red-cell frag- ments may appear in patients with sepsis (inde- pendent of disseminated intravascular coagula- tion) when binding of red cells to bacterial DNA causes deformation of the red-cell membrane.17,18 Schistocytes have also been described in patients with MDS, presumably resulting from ineffective erythropoiesis and increased red-cell fragility.19 For this reason, I think that the schistocytes are a \u201cred herring\u201d in this case that biased the initial diagnosis toward a destructive process such as TTP, rather than a production problem such as MDS.\nOverall, this patient\u2019s history and current\npresentation are consistent with progression of MDS. I suspect that the diagnostic test was a repeat bone marrow biopsy with cytogenetic analysis and next-generation sequencing.\n\n\n",
