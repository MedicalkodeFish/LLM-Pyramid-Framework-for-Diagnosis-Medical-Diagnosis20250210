    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jenna R. Lillemoe (Pediatrics): An 11-year-old boy was seen in the emergency de- partment of this hospital because of ongoing vomiting and weight loss.\nOne month before this presentation, the patient was evaluated by his primary care pediatrician because of nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and weight loss. The patient and his parents reported that these symptoms had begun approxi- mately 3 months earlier and had worsened during the past 3 weeks. The nausea and vomiting occurred in the early morning, abated later in the day, and were exacerbated by stress. The patient also reported fatigue and an intermittent sensa- tion of regurgitation and burning in the throat. He had begun treatment with lansoprazole 5 days earlier, with no decrease in symptoms. On examination, the weight was 36.4 kg (37th percentile) and the height was 148.6 cm (58th percentile); at a visit to the primary care clinic 11 months earlier, the weight had been 40.5 kg (78th percentile) and the height had been 143.5 cm (62nd percentile). The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and without tenderness or masses. The re- mainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Omeprazole was prescribed, and the patient was referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist and a pediatric psychologist at this hospital.\nOn presentation to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital (3 weeks before this presentation), the patient reported that the nausea and vomiting had decreased slightly after he had begun treatment with omeprazole, and then the symptoms had worsened. The vomitus was nonbloody and nonbilious. He had normal bowel movements, without blood, two or three times each day.\nThe patient was a twin and had been born by cesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation. During infancy, he had had gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that was treated with ranitidine, omeprazole, and lansoprazole. He had been ad- mitted to a local hospital because of bronchiolitis at 15 months of age, after which he had occasional episodes of wheezing.\n \nWhen the patient was 5 years of age, de- creased appetite, weight loss, and episodes of vomiting preceded by sore throat developed, and he was evaluated by a pediatric gastroenterolo- gist at another hospital. At that time, an upper gastrointestinal series, performed after the ad- ministration of barium contrast, was normal. Tests for IgA and tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG were negative. Lansoprazole and an anti- reflux diet were prescribed, and the symptoms resolved over a period of approximately 2 months, after which the proton-pump inhibitor was dis- continued.\nWhen the patient was 6 years of age, he was\nreferred to a pediatric nephrologist at the other hospital because of hypertension. Renal ultra- sonography was normal, and the results of am- bulatory blood-pressure monitoring suggested the \u201cwhite coat\u201d effect (i.e., blood pressure ele- vated only in a clinical setting). The patient also had seasonal allergies, red\u2013green color blind- ness, and a history of speech delay and retractile testes.\nAt a visit to the primary care clinic when the patient was 9 years old, his body-mass index had been in the overweight range. One year before the current presentation, he had had a Salter\u2013 Harris type 2 fracture of the left fifth finger.\nThe patient had been receiving omeprazole and had no known allergies to medications; im- munizations were up to date. He lived with his parents and twin sister in a suburban area of New England. At school, he did well academi- cally and participated in sports. He had recently been preparing intensively for a private-school entrance examination. His father had type 1 dia- betes mellitus and hypertension, and a paternal uncle had hypothyroidism.\nThe results of the abdominal and general physical examinations were unchanged from those obtained at the primary care clinic, and an external rectal examination was normal. The dose of omeprazole was increased, and the pa- tient was advised to keep a food and symptom diary and follow up with a psychologist. Labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A diagnos- tic test was performed.\nEight days after presentation in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of this hospital (13 days before this presentation), the patient\u2019s father called the clinic to report worsening of the\n \npatient\u2019s vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue; the patient also seemed to be breathing heavily at times and reported dizziness when walking. Ondansetron was prescribed by telephone and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was scheduled for the next morning.\nDr. Maureen M. Leonard: The next day, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy. The esophagus, stomach, and small intestine were visualized. The esophagus appeared normal. The gastric body also appeared normal; how- ever, the gastric antrum was erythematous, which suggested the presence of inflammation. The second part of the duodenum had diffuse, mod- erate indentations of the circular folds (valves of Kerckring) that were described as moderately scalloped mucosa. Biopsy specimens of the dis- tal esophagus, gastric antrum, and duodenum were obtained for histopathological examina- tion. Other test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Lillemoe: Eleven days after the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, syncope occurred when the patient got up from bed in the early morning to use the bathroom. His parents called the gas- troenterologist, who recommended evaluation in the emergency department at this hospital.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient reported that the nausea and vomiting had not decreased, that his fatigue had progres- sively worsened, and that he felt weak. He had recently returned from a beach vacation in the southeastern United States, where he had used sunscreen and an umbrella for sun protection.\nOn examination, the patient was alert, inter- active, and appeared thin. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 87 beats per minute, the blood pressure 108/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambi- ent air. The weight was 33.7 kg (20th percen- tile). The oral mucous membranes were dry. On examination of the abdomen, mild tenderness of the left upper quadrant was noted. The skin was markedly tan, most notably on light-exposed areas, including the face. The remain- der of the physical examination was normal. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Alessio Fasano: This 11-year-old boy presents with recurrent nausea and vomiting, symptoms that are common among children of similar age.1-3 Vomiting involves the forceful expulsion of the contents of the stomach and is a highly coordinated, reflexive process controlled by the vomiting center of the central nervous system. The evolutionary role of vomiting is to rapidly clear ingested toxins, and it is often preceded by nausea, a warning signal that inhibits further food intake. Vomiting is a feature of many intes- tinal and extraintestinal, acute and chronic dis- orders, including elevated intracranial pressure, metabolic diseases, inflammation, and gastroin- testinal abnormalities (anatomical and mucosal).4 Therefore, the differential diagnosis includes several possible causes of recurrent nausea and vomiting that can be classified into functional, anatomical, and organic causes (Fig. 1).\nFunctional Causes\nMost causes of vomiting in childhood are func- tional and occur as the result of a highly interac- tive gut\u2013brain axis.5 In this patient, the characteristics of the vomiting provide critical insight into the differential diagnosis. Also, his history of GERD is informative. It is notable that, ac- cording to the physical examination, he had no fever, a rather benign abdominal examination, and no signs of rash, jaundice, decreased skin turgor, or petechiae. In contrast, the recent epi- sode of syncope when he got up from bed and the persistent vomiting with clinically signifi- cant weight loss arouse concern.\nIn light of these considerations, all the func- tional causes can be reasonably ruled out. The patient\u2019s personal history is not compatible with eating disorders, rumination, or Munchausen\u2019s syndrome. Functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome, functional vomiting, and func- tional dyspepsia are rarely associated with weight loss. The characteristics of the patient\u2019s vomit- ing episodes are not compatible with gastropa- resis, a condition in which vomiting worsens during the day rather than abates.6 Cyclic vomit- ing syndrome is a rather underrecognized and probably underdiagnosed episodic disorder as- sociated with migraine; it occurs predominantly in childhood, with attacks that are stereotyped for individual persons and that have predictable periodicity,7 features that are not described in this patient.\n\nAnatomical Causes\nTypical symptoms of strangulated hernia include nausea, vomiting, fever, sudden pain that quick- ly escalates to severe, excruciating pain, and the inability to pass stool or gas8; with the excep- tions of nausea and vomiting, these symptoms were not reported by this patient. Similarly, he did not present with bilious vomiting, a dis- tended abdomen, changes in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea or constipation), or bloody stools, symptoms that are commonly associated with malrotation with midgut volvulus.9\nThe typical features of intussusception in- clude fever, lethargy, bilious vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and abdominal distention,10 symptoms that were also not reported by this patient. Fi- nally, anatomical gastrointestinal obstructions such as superior mesenteric artery syndrome and pancreatic pseudocyst are not compatible with this patient\u2019s history (e.g., no history of abdom- inal trauma, spinal surgery to correct scoliosis, or sudden weight loss) nor with his symptoms (e.g., absence of bloating, early satiety, belch- ing, and signs of obstruction of the small intes- tine).11,12\n\nOrganic Causes\nGiven that it is unlikely that this patient\u2019s nausea and vomiting can be explained by a functional or anatomical cause, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed to organic causes. The patient\u2019s history and laboratory test results are not com- patible with some of the possible organic causes, including diabetic ketoacidosis, alcohol consump- tion, the use of illicit drugs, neurologic causes, food poisoning, infections, or genitourinary diseases. Therefore, we are left with gastrointes- tinal diseases and metabolic disorders to explain this patient\u2019s symptoms.\nAmong the gastrointestinal diseases that are characterized by recurrent nausea and vomiting,GERD, peptic duodenitis, celiac disease, eosino- philic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori gastritis, biliary dyskinesia, and cholelithiasis should be considered. The fact that the patient\u2019s symptoms were not ameliorated by treatment with proton- pump inhibitors seems to rule out GERD, peptic duodenitis, and potentially, H. pylori gastritis. Furthermore, his clinical presentation makes cholelithiasis and biliary dyskinesia unlikely. Finally, his laboratory test results are not com- patible with a diagnosis of eosinophilic esopha- gitis, and this entity can be ruled out on the basis of the histologic examination of the esoph- ageal mucosa, which showed an increased num- ber of eosinophils in the lamina propria.13 There- fore, celiac disease remains the most likely cause of his symptoms, since nausea, vomiting, chron- ic fatigue, and weight loss are all possible clini- cal manifestations of the disease.\n\nCeliac Disease\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune enteropathy triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing grains (e.g., wheat, rye, and barley) in persons who have a genetic predisposition to the dis- ease.14,15 Celiac disease persists in the continued presence of gliadin, the toxic component of gluten. Other characteristics of the disease in- clude a highly specific autoantibody response against tissue transglutaminase and a strong association with major histocompatibility com- plex haplotypes, specifically HLA DQ2 and DQ8.14,15 The diagnosis is based on screening tests for the presence of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase in combination with compati- ble typical clinical features in symptomatic pa- tients.15 The confirmation of the diagnosis is obtained by means of an esophagogastroduode- noscopy, with biopsy specimens of the duode- num showing evidence of classic celiac enter- opathy, which is characterized by an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous blunting, and crypt hyperplasia.14,15 Therefore, the laboratory tests requested by the pediatric gastroenterologist, which most likely included testing for antibodies to tissue transglutamin- ase, as well as histologic examination of the bi- opsy specimens, would be instrumental in con- firming the diagnosis of celiac disease in this patient.\nThe patient\u2019s history of a Salter\u2013Harris type 2 fracture of the left fifth finger (possible indirect evidence of osteoporosis \u2014 a potential compli- cation of celiac disease15) in combination with his family history of autoimmune diseases (i.e., type 1 diabetes mellitus in his father and hypo- thyroidism in his paternal uncle, both of which are often associated with celiac disease14,15) sup- ports this possible diagnosis. In addition, the endoscopic findings of diffuse, moderately scal- loped mucosa that were observed in the duode- num are very suggestive,16 but not diagnostic,17 of celiac enteropathy.\nAlthough celiac disease is a likely diagnosis in this patient, there are two features of this case that need to be explained. First, when the patient was 5 years of age, a screening test for celiac disease was negative. Nevertheless, con- trary to outdated evidence, loss of tolerance to gluten among persons who are genetically at risk for celiac disease does not always occur at the time of first exposure; rather, it can occur later in life as a result of additional environmen- tal factors, including changes in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiome.14,15 Second, we need to explain this patient\u2019s clinical worsening after he underwent esophagogastro- duodenoscopy \u2014 particularly his fatigue, heavy breathing, and dizziness when walking. Even more worrisome is the report that 11 days after his esophagogastroduodenoscopy, syncope oc- curred when the patient got up from bed in the early morning to use the bathroom. This clinical evolution suggested the possibility that, in addi- tion to celiac disease, a metabolic cause of his symptoms could be part of the clinical picture. On the basis of his history, clinical findings, and laboratory test results, diabetic ketoacidosis, re- nal tubular acidosis, hypercalcemia, and other rare causes of acidosis or alkalosis can be rea- sonably ruled out, leaving adrenal insufficiency as a metabolic disorder that could be contribut- ing to his symptoms and more recent clinical deterioration.\nAdrenal Insufficiency\nAdrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder that can be a primary or secondary illness.18-21 Addison\u2019s disease, the common term for primary adrenal insufficiency, occurs when the adrenal glands are damaged and cannot produce an adequate amount of the hormone cortisol. The adrenal hormone aldosterone may also be lacking. Ad- dison\u2019s disease affects 110 to 144 of every 1 mil- lion people in industrialized countries.22 Second- ary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate amount of corticotropin, a hormone that stimu- lates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.18-21 Secondary adrenal insufficiency is much more common than Addison\u2019s disease. This patient had several common signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (Table 2). It is noteworthy that some key features were either not reported (e.g., craving for salty foods) or not detected (e.g., hypoglycemia and elevated blood potassium level).\nAn intriguing aspect to be considered in this case is related to the hyperpigmentation or dark- ness of the skin, which has been reported to be a typical sign of adrenal insufficiency.18-21 The skin of this patient was reported to be markedly tan, most notably on light-exposed areas, includ- ing the face. This feature could be explained by the fact that he had recently returned from a beach vacation; however, he had used sunscreen and an umbrella for protection from the sun.\nOn the basis of all the aforementioned con- siderations and the known compatible and non- compatible signs and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is the combination of celiac disease and adrenal insufficiency.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. George Eng: A screening test for celiac disease showed a markedly elevated tissue transglutam- inase IgA level in the blood (>300 IU per milli- liter; normal range, 0 to 15) that was suggestive of the disease. Histologic evaluation of the pa- tient\u2019s duodenal biopsy specimen (Fig. 2) re- vealed marked atrophy of the duodenal villi, crypt hyperplasia, and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (>30 per 100 entero- cytes), findings that confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease (modified Marsh classification 3b [on a scale of 0 to 3c, with 3c indicating com- plete villous atrophy]).\nAdditional laboratory test results were obtained after the patient presented to the emer- gency department. The patient\u2019s basic metabolic panel showed a decreased blood sodium level (113 mmol per liter; normal range, 135 to 145) and an elevated potassium level (5.5 mmol per liter; normal range, 3.4 to 5.0), findings that, in this clinical context, were suggestive of a mineralo- corticoid deficiency. Plasma renin activity mea- sured a few hours later, when the sodium level had risen to 116 mmol per liter, was elevated at 44 ng per milliliter per hour (normal range, 0.9 to 2.9); these findings were also consistent with mineralocorticoid deficiency. The late-afternoon blood cortisol level was low (3.7 \u03bcg per deci- liter [102 nmol per liter]; normal range between noon and 8 p.m., 5 to 15 \u03bcg per deciliter [138 to 414 nmol per liter]), despite a markedly elevated blood corticotropin level (1414 pg per milliliter [311 pmol per liter]; normal range, 6 to 76 pg per milliliter [1 to 17 pmol per liter]). Given these laboratory and clinical findings, a diagno- sis of primary adrenal insufficiency (i.e., Addi- son\u2019s disease) was presumptively made and for- mal testing with an adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test was not pursued.\nThe specific cause of this patient\u2019s adrenal insufficiency was confirmed by the identifica- tion of antibodies against 21-hydroxylase, which are normally absent in patients who do not have adrenal insufficiency. The enzyme 21-hydroxy- lase is essential for the synthesis of both miner- alocorticoid and glucocorticoid in the adrenal cortex. Autoimmunity is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency and can be as- sociated with other disorders, such as celiac disease, which was also diagnosed in this pa- tient.24,25 In addition, levels of very-long-chain fatty acids were normal, a finding that rules out adrenoleukodystrophy in this patient.\n\n \n\n",
