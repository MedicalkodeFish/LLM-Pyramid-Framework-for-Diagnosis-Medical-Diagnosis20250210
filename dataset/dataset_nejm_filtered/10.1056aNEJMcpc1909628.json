    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Michael B. Feldman: A 20-year-old man with a history of electronic-cigarette (e-cigarette) use, also known as vaping, was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of progressive dyspnea and abnormal findings on chest imaging. The patient had been well until approximately 6.5 months before this presenta- tion, when fatigue, fever, chills, and cough productive of rust-colored sputum developed; there was no hemoptysis. He was evaluated by a physician at another hospital. The patient reported that he had started using e-cigarettes approximate- ly 8 weeks earlier. He was advised to discontinue use of e-cigarettes, and a course\nof azithromycin was prescribed.\nDespite the empirical antibiotic treatment, the symptoms persisted. A chest radiograph obtained approximately 5.5 months before this presentation showed a nodular consolidation in the right lower lung that was suggestive of pneumonia. Another course of azithromycin was prescribed; when symptoms did not abate, the patient received levofloxacin, and follow-up chest imaging was scheduled.\nDr. Brent P. Little: Approximately 4 weeks later, repeat chest radiography at the other hospital revealed persistent, nodular opacities in the right mid lung; new hazy pulmonary opacities had also developed in both lungs. Two weeks later, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed faint ground-glass nodular opacities that were most prominent in the lower lungs. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopa- thy was present, the heart size was normal, and the pulmonary arteries were normal in caliber (Fig. 1A). The patient was referred to a pulmonologist.\nDr. Feldman: Three weeks later, the patient was evaluated in the pulmonary clinic of the other hospital. He reported ongoing cough productive of clear and yellow secretions, malaise, and intermittent fever. He had had no weight loss, night sweats, hemoptysis, or chest discomfort. On examination, he was described as appearing well. The pulse was 88 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. Breath sounds were normal in both lungs, and no clubbing or cyanosis of the hands or feet was noted. The patient was advised again to discontinue use of e-cigarettes and to undergo follow-up chest CT in 3 months.\nNine weeks later (approximately 6 weeks be- fore this presentation), the patient returned to the pulmonary clinic of the other hospital. He reported resolution of cough and sputum pro- duction but had noticed mild, intermittent dys- pnea on exertion; he had no chest pain, fever, chills, or weight loss. The pulse was 87 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/78 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breath- ing ambient air. The physical examination was unchanged. The complete blood count, compre- hensive metabolic panel (including results of renal- and liver-function tests), and urinalysis were normal. Blood tests for antineutrophil cy- toplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) (including anti- bodies to myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM antibodies were neg- ative, as was a nucleic acid test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. Follow-up imaging studies were scheduled.\nDr. Little: Six weeks before this presentation,\nCT of the chest, performed without the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, re- vealed an increase in the size, attenuation, and number of ground-glass nodular opacities that were most prominent in the lower lungs. Areas of conf luence had developed in a peribroncho- vascular distribution (Fig. 1B). Tests of pulmo- nary function were performed (Table 1), and the patient was referred to the pulmonary clinic of this hospital.\nDr. Feldman: On presentation to this hospital, the patient reported rhinorrhea with yellow-white mucus, postnasal drip, and sinus headaches. He reported that dyspnea occurred on exertion, including when he climbed the stairs in his dor- mitory; the dyspnea had increased progressively during the past 3 months. He had mild morning stiffness in his hands that would resolve after a few minutes of activity. He had a history of anxiety, attention deficit\u2013hyperactivity disorder, childhood asthma, and allergies. His medications were sertraline and extended-release dextroam- phetamine and amphetamine. He had no known medication allergies. He lived with roommates in a dormitory in New England, where he attended college and studied landscape architecture. As part of his course work and practical work in college, he had exposures to grasses, fertilizers, and pesticides; however, he had had no contact with these in the previous 5 months, during the winter. He reported no regular exposures to pets or birds and had not traveled outside of New England. He had no history of tobacco use, but he had begun daily use of e-cigarettes, with in- halation of a mango-flavored, nicotine-containing vapor, 8 months before this presentation. He re- portedly drank 12 beers every weekend. He occa- sionally smoked marijuana but reported no use of illicit drugs. His father had obstructive sleep apnea, his paternal grandfather had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, his maternal grand- father had rheumatoid arthritis and possible pulmonary fibrosis, and three maternal cousins had multiple sclerosis.\nOn examination, the patient appeared well. The temperature was 36.3\u00b0C, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/58 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The oropharynx appeared normal, with no ulcers; the heart sounds were regular, and the lung sounds were clear. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nScreening tests for hypersensitivity pneumo- nitis, antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and antibodies to Lyme disease were all negative. The levels of electrolytes, glucose, total protein, and globulin were normal, as were the results of renal- function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 2. Tests of pulmo- nary function were performed (Table 1). The patient was again advised to discontinue e-ciga- rette use, and plans were made for close follow- up to assess the trajectory of his lung disease.\nTwo months later, the patient reported that he had discontinued regular use of e-cigarettes; however, after he had used e-cigarettes 2 weeks earlier, he had started to have transient chest tightness. He continued to have persistent exer- tional dyspnea after climbing several flights of stairs, and he had nasal congestion. The oxygen saturation was 97% while he was breathing am- bient air; the remainder of the physical examina- tion was normal. Tests of pulmonary function were again performed (Table 1), and additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Little: High-resolution CT images of the chest, obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed a marked increase in ground-glass nodular opacities that were most prominent in the lower lungs (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of bronchiectasis, bron- chial-wall thickening, or other primary airway disease. Findings of fibrosis, such as honeycomb- ing, reticulation, traction bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion, were also absent.\nDr. Feldman: Blood tests for antibodies to the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, Ro (SSA), La (SSB), Scl-70, and Jo-1 were negative. A urinalysis was normal.\n\nFigure 1. Initial CT Scans of the Chest.\nAn axial image from a scan with lung windows, ob\u2011 tained 4 months before this presentation (Panel A), shows a mild mosaic attenuation pattern in the lungs with faint ground\u2011glass nodular opacities in the lower lungs; the ground\u2011glass opacities have a centrilobular and peribronchovascular distribution (arrows). An axial image from the same level of the lower lungs obtained 6 weeks before this presentation (Panel B) shows an increase in the size, attenuation, and number of ground\u2011 glass nodular opacities, and areas of confluence are present.\n\nTable 1.

Additional CT Scans of the Chest.\nTwo months after presentation to this hospital, axial images of the lower lungs show marked progression of ground\u2011glass nodular opacities in both lungs. Many of the opacities have become confluent, with promi\u2011 nent clustering around the bronchovascular bundles (Panels A and B, arrows). A coronal reformatted image (Panel C) shows a markedly increased distribution of ground\u2011glass opacities in the lower lungs. There is no evidence of primary airway disease (e.g., bronchiectasis or bronchial\u2011wall thickening), and features of fibrosis (e.g., honeycombing and reticulation) are also absent.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Robert W. Hallowell: This 20-year-old previously healthy man presents with a 6-month history of chronic respiratory illness accompanied by pro- gressive ground-glass nodular opacities in a basilar-predominant, peribronchovascular distri- bution. Intermittent fever, joint stiffness, sinus headaches, and nasal congestion are suggestive of a systemic process.\nThe use of e-cigarettes before the onset of this patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms arouses con- cern about a smoking-related lung disease or vaping-related toxic effects. The aerosolized nico- tine carriers and f lavorings that are found in e-cigarette fluid contain numerous toxins and irritants,2,3 and various pulmonary diseases at- tributed to the use of e-cigarettes have been re- ported.4-10 However, the presence of an obvious environmental exposure such as e-cigarette vapor may be misleading; therefore, I will construct a differential diagnosis on the basis of the imag- ing findings of diffuse ground-glass nodular opacities \u2014 the underlying pathophysiological finding in this case \u2014 which are typically caused by partially filled air spaces, partially collapsed alveoli, or interstitial thickening. These processes occur as a result of the abnormal pres- ence of one of the following in the lung: water (which causes edema), infection, cancer, inflam- mation, or blood.\n\nPulmonary Edema\nAlthough cardiogenic pulmonary edema is unlike- ly in a 20-year-old man with no cardiac-related pathological findings, other potential causes of pulmonary edema should be considered in this patient. Pulmonary-capillary hemangiomatosis and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease are con- sidered the same entity and comprise a group of rare conditions characterized by widespread fi- brosis of the pulmonary venules. The presence of ground-glass opacities is common in this dis- ease and is caused by vascular congestion and pulmonary edema. However, ground-glass opac- ities occur most commonly in a centrilobular distribution and are accompanied by other ra- diographic signs of postcapillary venous conges- tion or volume overload, including septal thick- ening, pleural effusions, or pericardial effusions, none of which are present on this patient\u2019s im- aging studies.11,12 Furthermore, other radiograph- ic and clinical signs of pulmonary hypertension\n\u2014 the cardinal feature of  pulmonary-capillary\nhemangiomatosis and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease \u2014 were not reported.\n\nInfection\nThis patient\u2019s history of fever and productive cough are compatible with infection, and several opportunistic and atypical infections have been known to cause ground-glass opacities.13,14 How- ever, there is no evidence to suggest that this patient is immunocompromised or vulnerable to opportunistic infection. In addition, he received several courses of antimicrobial therapy that tar- geted community-acquired pathogens without resolution of his symptoms. Furthermore, de- spite the patient\u2019s potential exposure to soil as a landscape architecture student, the imaging stud- ies do not show discreet nodularity, a feature that is typically associated with acute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis15 or other fungal infec- tions.16\n\nCancer\nAtypical adenomatous hyperplasia and multifocal adenocarcinoma in situ can be manifested by ground-glass nodular opacities in a radiographic distribution similar to that observed in this pa- tient.17-19 However, the extensive multifocal nature of the patient\u2019s disease, his age, and the tempo of radiographic progression make a diagnosis of cancer highly unlikely.\n\nInflammation\nRespiratory bronchiolitis\u2013associated interstitial lung disease is an inflammatory disease of the lung that occurs almost exclusively in smokers, although a case in which this disease was poten- tially caused by e-cigarette use has been report- ed.20 Respiratory bronchiolitis\u2013associated intersti- tial lung disease is characterized histologically by the presence of pigmented macrophages (also known as \u201csmokers\u2019 macrophages\u201d) in the respi- ratory bronchioles and surrounding airspaces.21 However, the ground-glass abnormalities seen with this condition tend to occur in a centri- lobular distribution22,23 and are typically associ- ated with bronchial thickening,22 a finding that is absent in this case.\nExogenous lipoid pneumonia results from a chronic inflammatory reaction caused by the presence of fatlike material in the lung paren- chyma. The vegetable glycerin (i.e., glycerol) used as a nicotine carrier in e-cigarettes is a potential source of exogenous lipid in the airways, and although the presence of this lipid is not a prominent pathological feature in the recent national outbreak of vaping-associated lung dis- ease,24 lipoid pneumonia resulting from e-ciga- rette use has been reported.6,25,26 However, subacute disease would cause a greater degree of consolidation, septal thickening, or coalescence of the ground-glass opacities than that seen in this patient.6,25-27\nAcute eosinophilic pneumonia has been linked to the use of tobacco products28,29 and, recently, to the use of e-cigarettes.7 However, this patient\u2019s subacute presentation is more consistent with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, which is typi- cally associated with at least a mild peripheral eosinophilia and with infiltrates that are more peripheral and consolidated in nature than those noted in this patient.28-34\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis results from an immunologic reaction in the lung to an inhaled organic antigen. Acute or subacute hypersensi- tivity pneumonitis can cause diffuse ground- glass opacities with a mosaic attenuation, even when a patient has a negative serologic test for precipitins.35,36 However, this disorder is typi- cally associated with discreet nodules, micro- nodules, air trapping, and a centrilobular distri- bution of the opacities.23,35,37-39\nSarcoidosis is a systemic condition of un- known cause that is characterized by the pres- ence of noncaseating granulomas in the affected tissues. The finding of ground-glass nodular opacities in a peribronchovascular distribution seen in this patient, in combination with fever and joint symptoms, is consistent with sarcoid- osis. However, the absence of hilar or mediasti- nal lymphadenopathy, the presence of fewer than the typical number of solid nodules along the fissures or in a perilymphatic distribution, and the prominence of the opacities in the lower lobes would make this an unusual presentation of sarcoidosis.40,41\nOrganizing pneumonia is a form of lung inflammation that is characterized by the presence of granulation tissue within the alveoli and bron- chioles.42 Organizing pneumonia can be mani- fested by areas of ground-glass attenuation in a peribronchovascular distribution, and a promi- nence in the lower lobes is common. However, the fact that this patient\u2019s ground-glass abnor- malities remained patchy, without radiographi- cally significant coalescence and without a greater number of solid nodules or areas of more dense consolidation despite the progression of disease, would make this a rather atypical radiographic manifestation of organizing pneumonia.43,44\nPulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a lymphoproliferative disorder that is commonly associated with Epstein\u2013Barr virus.45 Pathological features in the lung include an infiltrate com- posed of plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, and atypical lymphoreticular cells.46 Radiographi- cally, pulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis manifests as abnormalities in a diffuse, broncho- vascular pattern with a basilar prominence. However, in contrast to this patient\u2019s presenta- tion, the predominant feature is that of more dense and more well-defined nodules.46,47\nGranulomatous\u2013lymphocytic interstitial lung disease is a diffuse parenchymal lung disease that occurs exclusively in patients who have a primary immune deficiency such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). It is charac- terized pathologically by the presence of lympho- cytes, granulomas, and organizing pneumonia in an interstitial and peribronchiolar distribution.48 The diffuse ground-glass opacities observed in patients with this disease are typically associat- ed with solid nodules, interlobular septal thick- ening, some degree of consolidation, and lymph- adenopathy,49,50 findings that are not present in this case. Finally, although granulomatous\u2013lym- phocytic interstitial lung disease has been re- ported as the initial presenting feature of CVID,51 the fact that this patient does not have either known CVID or a history of recurrent infections suggestive of a primary immune deficiency would make the diagnosis of granulomatous\u2013lympho- cytic interstitial lung disease unlikely.\nBlood or Hemorrhage\nThe patient\u2019s rust-colored sputum could indicate the presence of old blood. Classically, alveolar hemorrhage results in an elevated diffusing ca- pacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) owing to the sequestering of carbon monoxide by the free erythrocytes in the alveolar spaces, but this patient\u2019s DLco remained below the nor- mal range. However, there was a period during which his DLco started to rise despite a declin- ing forced vital capacity, a finding potentially consistent with active alveolar bleeding.\nIdiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a con- dition that is characterized by recurrent episodes of spontaneous diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, with histologic evidence of capillary damage in the absence of immune complex deposition.52 Al- though this condition typically manifests itself in childhood, onset in adulthood has been re- ported.53 However, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, one would expect the ground-glass opacities to wax and wane or mi- grate between hemorrhagic episodes rather than to progress in the slow and steady manner ob- served in this case.\nAnti\u2013glomerular basement membrane (antiGBM) disease with lung involvement is a disease in which autoantibodies are directed against the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen, which is found in the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney and in the alveoli of the lung. Although this disease is typically associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, isolated pulmo- nary involvement can occur, and previous expo- sure to tobacco products and other inhaled sub- stances appears to be a risk factor for the development of alveolar hemorrhage.54,55 The ra- diographic findings in this case are consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage; however, anti-GBM disease is unlikely, given the negative result on antibody testing that has already been completed. The persistence of fever and development of nasal and sinus symptoms arouse suspicion of a systemic process, such as vasculitis. The peri- bronchovascular distribution and basilar promi- nence of the ground-glass opacities seen in this patient are consistent with areas of alveolar hem- orrhage that often accompany these symptoms. Both eosinophilic granulomatosis with poly- angiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis frequently occur in the absence of ANCAs.56,57 Although ground-glass opacities are more com- mon among patients with eosinophilic granulo- matosis with polyangiitis than among those with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosino- philic granulomatosis with polyangiitis occurs almost exclusively in the presence of at least a mild peripheral eosinophilia and is typically as- sociated with previous or concurrent asthma,56,57 neither of which was present in this patient. Although concurrent sinus involvement would not be unusual in the context of granulomatosis with polyangiitis,58 and ground-glass opacities are possible owing to areas of hemorrhage, this disorder typically manifests with more evidence of nodular or consolidative disease on chest im-\naging.59,60\nMicroscopic polyangiitis is a small-vessel vasculitis in which pulmonary hemorrhage occurs. However, renal involvement in the form of necro- tizing glomerulonephritis and myeloperoxidase ANCA positivity are present in the overwhelming majority of cases,61,62 making microscopic polyan- giitis an unlikely diagnosis in this patient.\nHenoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura is an IgA vasculitis of the small vessels that primarily affects children, and alveolar hemorrhage has rarely been associated with this condition in either children or adults.63 However, Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura is classically associated with palpable purpura, arthritis, abdominal pain, and renal disease. This patient reported only mild and transient morning stiffness in his hands. Although most patients do not present with all these features simultaneously, it is unlikely that Henoch\u2013 Sch\u00f6nlein purpura would manifest as isolated pulmonary involvement.\nIsolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis is a condition that is characterized by the pres- ence of capillaritis and subsequent alveolar hem- orrhage in the absence of autoantibodies and without evidence of a systemic vasculitis or under- lying connective-tissue disease. In affected pa- tients, cough, fever, dyspnea, rhinitis, and sinus congestion develop over the course of several weeks to months. Furthermore, the absence of frank hemoptysis and the presence of normal or only mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rates, as was the case in this patient, have been reported.64 Although isolated pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis is a rare condition, it is clinically most consistent with this patient\u2019s presen- tation and is therefore the most likely diagnosis. In any patient with suspected pulmonary hem- orrhage or vasculitis, laboratory tests would typi- cally be performed to assess whether an underly- ing autoimmune condition is present. Many such tests have already been performed in this pa- tient, but consideration may also be given to testing for complement levels, anticardiolipin antibodies, and \u03b22-glycoprotein antibodies. With\nthe exception of infection, eosinophilic pneumonia, and sarcoidosis, most of the more likely di- agnoses described above, particularly an under- lying vasculitis with alveolar hemorrhage, can be ruled out only by surgical lung biopsy. Therefore, I would refer the patient directly for video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy as the most efficient next step in the evaluation of this patient.",
