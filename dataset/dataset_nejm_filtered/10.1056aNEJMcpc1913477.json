    "Primary Symptom": "A 79-Year-Old Man with Hyponatremia and Involuntary Movements of the Arm and Face",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Joseph A. Rosenthal (Medicine): A 79-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of hyponatremia and involuntary movements of the arm and face.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health and walking 3 miles per day until 5 weeks before the current admission, when fatigue developed. During his daily walks, he began resting after walking a quarter mile because of fatigue; there was no chest pain, dyspnea, or leg pain. In addition, he began taking naps during the day, which was unusual for him. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to his primary care provider for evaluation. Laboratory stud- ies reportedly revealed hyponatremia. He was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported no history of orthopnea or leg swelling, although his weight had increased by 2.2 kg during the past year. He reported eating and drinking normally, with no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He had no weakness, loss of sensation, headache, or vision changes. Other medical his- tory was notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Medications included lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and atorvastatin; there were no known allergies to medications. He had smoked tobacco in the past but had quit 40 years earlier; he drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. He was a retired teacher and lived with his wife in New England. His family history included heart disease in his father and pancreatic cancer in his mother.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 156/76 mm Hg, the pulse 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 74.8 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.4. The physical examination was normal.\nThe blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter (reference range, 135 to 145); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient received 250 ml of intravenous isotonic fluids. Four hours later, the blood sodium level was 127 mmol per liter. The patient was instructed to stop taking hydrochlo- rothiazide and to follow up with his primary care physician; he was discharged from the emergency department.\nAfter the patient returned home, his fatigue diminished. One week later, involuntary move- ments in the left arm and hand developed. The patient described the movements as spasms that caused the arm to flex at the elbow or wrist. The episodes lasted less than 5 seconds and occurred multiple times per day. They often occurred after position changes or sudden movements and often caused him to drop any object he was holding in his left hand. He described feeling a strange sensation immediately before the movements but being unable to suppress them. The patient\u2019s wife had noticed that occasionally during the involun- tary movements of the left arm and hand, the left side of the patient\u2019s face pulled to the side as though he were grimacing. The episodes in- creased in frequency during the next 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after discharge from the emergency department, the patient returned to this hospital for additional evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patellar reflexes were 3+;\nthe remainder of the physical examination was normal. The blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood levels of thyrotropin and N-termi- nal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal. The blood cortisol level was 13.5 \u03bcg per deciliter; 30 minutes after the administration of 250 \u03bcg of cosyntropin, the blood cortisol level was 27.9 \u03bcg per deciliter. The patient received 1 liter of intra- venous isotonic f luids. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, re- vealed mild, scattered, nonspecific hypoattenua- tion of the periventricular and subcortical white matter bilaterally. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation.\nTen hours later, the blood sodium level was 121 mmol per liter. The patient was asked to limit his intake of water to less than 1 liter per day, and sodium chloride tablets were adminis- tered. Twelve hours later, the blood sodium level was 123 mmol per liter. A single, unwitnessed episode of involuntary movement of the left arm and left side of the face occurred.\nOn the second and third hospital days, intra- venous desmopressin and hypertonic fluids were administered, and the blood sodium level gradu- ally increased to 132 mmol per liter. Additional imaging studies were obtained. Magnetic reso- nance imaging of the head was performed be- fore and after the administration of intravenous contrast material; T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed mild, scattered hyperintensities in the periventricular and sub- cortical white matter. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material; the scan showed a small cluster of nodules and linear opacities in the right middle lobe and multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and bilateral hip joints.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the administra- tion of intravenous hypertonic fluids and desmo- pressin was stopped, oral furosemide was added, and sodium chloride tablets were continued. Over the next 3 days, the blood sodium level increased to 137 mmol per liter. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day having had no additional episodes of involuntary movements.\nThe blood sodium level was normal 2 days after discharge and again 8 days after discharge. The patient was instructed to drink water when he was thirsty without limiting his daily intake. Two weeks after discharge, the patient noticed recurrence of the involuntary movements of the left arm and left side of the face. He was evalu- ated by his primary care physician. The physical examination was normal, and no involuntary movements were observed. The blood sodium level was 134 mmol per liter. The patient was instructed to limit his intake of water to 2 liters per day.\nFour weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the nephrology clinic of this hospi- tal. He reported that the involuntary movements of the left arm and left side of the face had in- creased in frequency, occurring once per hour. The blood sodium level was 134 mmol per liter. He was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital for further evaluation. At the neurology clinic, a diagnostic test was performed, and a diagnosis was made.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Cynthia M. Cooper: This healthy, active 79-year- old man initially had fatigue without any local- izing symptoms. He received a diagnosis of hypo- natremia, which could potentially account for his general malaise. Given that hyponatremia was the first and most persistent abnormality found in this patient, I will develop my initial differential diagnosis around this finding.\nHyponatremia is the most common electrolyte derangement in hospitalized patients, and there are many approaches to its evaluation.1-4 When considering the cause of hyponatremia in any patient, I ask a series of questions to narrow my differential diagnosis.\nHyperglycemia\nDoes the patient have hyperglycemia? Extracel- lular hyperglycemia, which commonly occurs in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, creates an osmotic gradient that pulls intracellular water into the extracellular space.5 This movement of water results in cellular shrinkage and ultimate- ly lowers the blood sodium level. Several formu- las can be used to predict what the blood sodi- um level would be without the presence of hyperglycemia.6,7 The slightly elevated glucose level noted during this patient\u2019s evaluation in the emergency department 3 weeks before the cur- rent admission would not explain his hyponatre- mia. Given that his glucose level was normal at the time of this presentation, we can rule out hyperglycemia as the cause of this patient\u2019s hy- ponatremia.\n\nSerum Osmolality\nWhat is the patient\u2019s serum osmolality? The measured serum osmolality can be used to ap- proximate the forces that draw water either into or out of cells, except when the serum urea level is very high, in which case, serum tonicity pro- vides a more accurate approximation.8 Hyperos- molar hyponatremia \u2014 which can be due to hyperglycemia or other iatrogenic causes, such as the administration of mannitol or intravenous immune globulin \u2014 causes intracellular water to move into the extracellular space, resulting in cellular shrinkage and lowering the blood sodium level. Pseudohyponatremia is an unusual phenom- enon in which a high level of protein or lipids interferes with the blood sodium measurement9; in patients with this condition, the blood sodium level obtained by means of direct potentiometry is normal, as is cell size, with no net movement of water into or out of cells. Hypo-osmolar hypo- natremia reflects a true imbalance between the water level and the sodium level that causes cellu- lar swelling and ultimately results in dilution in both the extracellular and the intracellular spaces.5 The serum osmolality was not measured during this patient\u2019s evaluation in the emergency depart- ment 3 weeks before the current admission, but it was low during the current presentation, confirm- ing the presence of hypo-osmolar hyponatremia.\nRenal Function\nDoes this patient have a renal abnormality that explains the finding of hypo-osmolar hyponatre- mia? Maintaining a normal blood sodium level\n \n\nrequires appropriate water intake as well as func- tioning kidneys that can both limit water excre- tion through concentration of urine (to avoid hypernatremia) and excrete large volumes of max- imally dilute urine (to avoid hyponatremia). The fundamental limits on the excretion of dilute urine are the glomerular filtration rate and the efficiency of the nephron in producing maxi- mally dilute urine. Patients with advanced renal failure have a limited ability to balance water intake and water clearance because they have a diminished glomerular filtration rate and a limit- ed capacity for dilution.10\nThis patient\u2019s renal function was normal.\nHowever, I would consider the thiazide diuretic he was taking for the management of hyperten- sion to be an obvious renal cause of hyponatre- mia. Thiazide diuretics act on the sodium chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, which is the \u201cdiluting segment\u201d in the cortex of the nephron. Thiazide diuretics limit the capac- ity of the kidneys to produce maximally dilute urine, thus limiting water excretion. When this patient was initially evaluated in the emergency department, his use of a thiazide diuretic was thought to be a plausible explanation for his hyponatremia, and the drug was discontinued. However, hyponatremia persisted for 3 weeks after the thiazide diuretic was discontinued, which makes diuretic use an unlikely cause in this case.\n\nAntidiuretic Hormone\nWhen this patient was admitted to the hospital, the measured urine osmolality was 720 mOsm per kilogram of water, a finding that suggests that antidiuretic hormone is present. Antidiuretic hormone is produced in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary in response to two physiologic stimuli.11 The day-to-day stim- ulus for the release of antidiuretic hormone is hyperosmolality, which is sensed through the shrinking of neuron bodies in the hypothalamus. This stimulus is abruptly shut off when the osmo- lality is normal or low, as it was in this patient. The emergency stimulus for the release of anti- diuretic hormone is hypovolemia, which is sensed in the arterial circulation and overrides osmolal- ity control. Release of antidiuretic hormone has effects both systemically, through the increase in vascular tone, and directly on the kidney, through the up-regulation of aquaporins in the luminal membrane of principal cells in the collecting ducts. These aquaporins allow for the movement of water across the previously impermeable con- fines of the collecting ducts, preventing the excretion of water and thus resulting in concen- trated urine. Water excess and hypo-osmolality, which were seen in this patient, should suppress the release of antidiuretic hormone unless a perceived hypovolemic stimulus persists.\n\nVolume Status\nOvert hypovolemia is a potent stimulus for the release of antidiuretic hormone, with the body appropriately limiting water excretion. Overt hy- pervolemia \u2014 which is seen in patients with edematous disorders, such as congestive heart failure or decompensated cirrhosis \u2014 also stim- ulates the release of antidiuretic hormone, in response to the perceived low effective arterial circulation. This patient\u2019s physical examination did not suggest hypovolemia, but subtle hypovo- lemia and euvolemia can be difficult to distin- guish from one another clinically, and investiga- tion of renal sodium and uric acid handling may help with the distinction. If this patient were to have hypovolemia, I would expect activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system to lead to sodium avidity with a low urine sodium level. His urine sodium level was higher than 100 mmol per liter, indicating that he did not have hypovo- lemia. In addition, his low blood uric acid level (<4 mg per deciliter [<238 \u03bcmol per liter]) sug- gests euvolemia.12 Finally, if this patient were to have hypovolemia, I would expect the blood so- dium level to increase after the administration of intravenous fluids, instead of decreasing, as it did when he was admitted to the hospital.\nSyndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuresis\nThis patient\u2019s clinical presentation with hypo- osmolar hyponatremia and antidiuretic hormone secretion with no apparent hypovolemic stimu- lus is consistent with the syndrome of inappro- priate antidiuresis. Severe hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency can also produce this clini- cal picture, but the patient had normal thyrotro- pin and cortisol levels. The differential diagno- sis for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis can be divided into five main categories: cancer, pulmonary disease, central nervous system (CNS) disease, drug use, and other causes, such as pain, nausea, or intense exercise.13\nThis patient underwent appropriate imaging\nof the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to look\n \nfor evidence of occult cancer, but no specific findings were detected. He was not taking any medications that are typically associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. De- spite a thorough evaluation, there was no clear cause of this syndrome. At this point, I will try to determine whether this patient\u2019s syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis could be linked to the worsening repetitive spasms involving the left arm and left side of the face.\n\nNeurologic Symptoms\nHyponatremia is associated with neurologic symp- toms that range from fatigue and cognitive slow- ing to seizures, coma, and death.5,14,15 However, it is notable that the patient did not have spasms of the arm and face when his blood sodium level was at its lowest and that these symptoms seemed to worsen when his blood sodium level was near normal.\nOsmotic demyelination syndrome is a worri- some complication of hyponatremia and its management. Symptoms can include seizures, paralysis, and Parkinson-like neuropathological features.16,17 Could osmotic demyelination syn- drome, potentially resulting from the initial cor- rection of hyponatremia, explain this patient\u2019s clinical picture? He had none of the typical risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome, such as severe hyponatremia (sodium level, <110 mmol per liter), liver disease, hypokalemia, alcoholism, or malnutrition.18 In addition, he had unilateral symptoms, which would be unlikely to be ex- plained by either hyponatremia or osmotic de- myelination syndrome.\nCould an underlying disease explain both the\nhyponatremia and the neurologic symptoms seen in this patient? If I were caring for this patient, who had a combination of symptoms that I had never encountered previously, I would search for cases already reported in the literature. After much trial and error, a PubMed search for the combination of \u201cface,\u201d \u201carm,\u201d \u201cdystonic,\u201d and \u201chyponatremia\u201d returned one result: an article entitled, \u201cFaciobrachial dystonic seizures precede Lgi1 antibody limbic encephalitis.\u201d19 Further searching for \u201cLGI1 antibody limbic encephali- tis\u201d and \u201chyponatremia\u201d turned up many publi- cations, primarily in the neurology literature, that linked this common type of limbic encephalitis with the clinical feature of hyponatremia, which is present in approximately 60% of cases.20,21 Of note, patients who have encephalitis associated with LGI1 (leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1) antibodies can have normal findings or nonspe- cific changes on MRI of the head, as were seen in this patient. The antibodies may be present in both the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and it has been proposed that the antibodies may affect hypothalamic release of antidiuretic hor- mone or directly act on receptors in the kidneys.22 The diagnosis of LGI1 encephalitis fits well with this patient\u2019s clinical course, including the initial presentation with fatigue and hyponatre- mia, as well as the subsequent distinctive facio- brachial dystonic seizures. To make the diagno- sis in this case, I would perform blood or CSF testing for LGI1 antibodies.\n",

The VGKC-complex antibodies were identified with the use of a radioimmunoprecipitation as- say,30 in which patient samples are incubated with VGKC-complex antigens that have been solubilized from cerebral cortex and labeled with radioactive (125I) \u03b1-dendrotoxin; if radioac- tivity is detected after the incubated sample has been probed by a secondary antibody to human IgG, then IgG to VGKC complexes are present. The LGI1 antibodies were identified with the use of a cell-based assay, in which a blood or CSF sample is applied to human embryonic kidney cells expressing the LGI1 protein and then a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody to hu- man IgG is used to visualize LGI1-targeted IgG binding to LGI1 protein.31 CSF analysis was not needed in this case. The patient received a diag- nosis of LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis on the basis of the presence of faciobrachial dystonic seizures and serum LGI1 autoantibodies.",
