    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Miranda M. Ravicz (Pediatrics): A 20-year-old man with bipolar disorder was transferred to this hospital because of hemoptysis and hypoxemia.\\nEleven months before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Six weeks before the current presentation, he was taken to another hospital for evaluation of racing thoughts, generalized hyperactivity, and difficulty sleeping. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. During the admission, the patient was involved in an altercation and was struck on the  left side of the chest; pain subsequently developed in that area. Five weeks before the current presentation, chest pain persisted, and nausea, vomiting, and de- creased appetite developed. The patient was transported from the psychiatric hospital to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation. Imag- ing studies were obtained.\\nDr. Teresa Victoria: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 1A) revealed\\nground-glass opacities in the left lower lobe.\\nDr. Ravicz: The patient was told that he had a pulmonary contusion and was transported back to the psychiatric hospital. The dosages of quetiapine and pali- peridone were increased. Four weeks before the current presentation, the patient had urticaria and intermittent nausea; a single dose of methylprednisolone was administered. Three weeks before the current presentation, the patient was dis- charged home.\\nTen days before the current presentation, chest pain continued, cough devel- oped, and nausea increased in severity. The patient was evaluated in the emer- gency department of a second hospital. Imaging studies were obtained.\\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest (Fig. 1B) revealed a consolidation in the\\nleft lower lobe and a left pleural effusion.\\nDr. Ravicz: A course of doxycycline was started for the treatment of presumed pneumonia, and the patient was discharged home.  During the subsequent 6 days,   the cough and chest pain abated. Four days before the current presentation, the  course of doxycycline was completed. During the next several days, the cough in- creased in severity and became productive of yellow sputum with dark-red streaks,and shortness of breath developed; nausea also increased in severity. One day before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated again in the emergency department of the second hospital. On evaluation, the patient appeared ill and had difficulty breathing. The temporal tempera- ture was 37.5\\u00b0C, the blood pressure 99/50 mm Hg, the heart rate 127 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 31 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The hemoglobin level was 11.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 14.0 to 18.0) and the albumin level 1.3 g per deciliter (reference range, 3.4 to 5.0). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were the results of liver- function tests. Nucleic acid amplification testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for in-fluenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial vi- rus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coro- navirus 2. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood was obtained for culture, and additional imaging studies were obtained.\\nDr. Victoria: CT angiography of the chest, per-\\nformed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed emboli of the right and left pulmonary arteries that extended into multiple segmental and subsegmental branches (Fig. 2). There were wedge-shaped opacities with- out enhancement in the left upper and lower lobes, findings consistent with infarction. There were small pleural effusions that were larger on the left side than on the right side.\\nDr. Ravicz: Treatment with enoxaparin, vanco-\\nmycin, and cefepime was started, and intrave- nous fluids were administered. The patient was admitted to the second hospital. On hospital day 2, the oxygen saturation decreased, and supple- mental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula. Blood cultures showed no growth. The patient was transferred to this hospital for ad- ditional evaluation and treatment.\\n\\nOn admission to this hospital, additional his- tory was obtained. The chest pain, cough, hemop- tysis, shortness of breath, and nausea continued. The patient reported fatigue and weight loss that had started after the injury to the chest. He had also noticed discoloration in his fingers that was associated with changes in temperature. There was no headache, abdominal pain, or joint pain. The patient had a history of asthma, migraines, and attention deficit\\u2013hyperactivity disorder. Bi- polar disorder had been diagnosed when he was hospitalized for mania, grandiose thoughts, and paranoid delusions. Medications included queti- apine, paliperidone, and methylphenidate. Sulfa drugs and valproate had caused rash,  nausea, and vomiting. The patient had previously been sexually active with female partners. He drank alcohol rarely and vaped marijuana frequently; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs.\\nHis mother, maternal aunt, paternal aunt,  and\\npaternal uncle had depression.\\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.6\\u00b0C, the blood pressure 89/40 mm Hg, the heart rate 121 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was receiving supplemen- tal oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The right lung was clear on auscultation, but the left lung had diminished sounds. There was no abdominal tenderness, joint swelling, or rash. The patient had a flat af- fect, apathy, grandiose thoughts, poverty of speech and thought, and psychomotor retardation. There was no evidence of paranoia or hallucinations. The hemoglobin level was 8.7 g per deciliter and the albumin level 1.6 g per deciliter. Urinalysis revealed 2+ blood and 3+ protein; other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1.\\nDiagnostic tests were performed.\\n\\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Shaun F. Fitzgerald: This 20-year-old man who had recently received a diagnosis of bipolar dis- order was evaluated for chest pain after trauma to the chest wall. Chest CT revealed ground- glass opacities; this finding is nonspecific, with possible causes including infectious processes, chronic interstitial lung disease, and acute alveo- lar disease. Although the differential diagnosis associated with this finding is broad, the initial diagnosis of pulmonary contusion was appropri- ate, given the history of trauma with few other symptoms present.\nHowever, during the next several weeks, short- ness of breath and cough with hemoptysis devel- oped. The evolution of the patient\u2019s respiratory symptoms and his subsequent imaging findings, including pulmonary embolism with pulmonary infarction, are more consistent with systemic dis- ease. In addition, the patient was found to have hypoalbuminemia, proteinuria, microscopic he- maturia, and an active urinary sediment with red cells and white cells. Although the presence of hypoalbuminemia may suggest the possibility of nephrotic syndrome, the absence of edema on physical examination makes nephrotic syndrome less likely. The active urinary sediment is sug- gestive of glomerulonephritis.\nIn developing a differential diagnosis for this patient, I will assume that the disease processes in the lungs and the kidneys are related. There- fore, I will focus on diseases that cause glomeru- lonephritis and pulmonary disease.\n\nInfective Endocarditis\nPatients with infective endocarditis involving the right side of the heart can have pulmonary emboli that originated from the tricuspid valve. In addition, patients with infective endocardi- tis can have glomerulonephritis that is caused by circulating immune complexes. This patient had fever on presentation to this hospital, which could be indicative of infection. How- ever, he did not have any specific risk factors for infective endocarditis or have a heart mur- mur or other examination findings associated with this condition. The absence of these findings and the negative blood cultures make a diagnosis of infective endocarditis unlikely in this case.\nPoststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis\nThis patient had presumed pneumonia, and his symptoms improved with the use of doxycycline. Could his renal process be explained by post- streptococcal glomerulonephritis? Group A strep- tococcus can cause community-acquired pneu- monia, but it is not a common cause, and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most likely to occur after pharyngitis or a skin or soft- tissue infection due to group A streptococcus. The absence of a documented antecedent group A streptococcal infection makes a diagnosis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis  unlikely, as does the absence of acute kidney injury.\n\nIgA Nephropathy or Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein Purpura Nephritis\nPatients with IgA nephropathy usually present with hematuria and evidence of an antecedent or concurrent upper respiratory infection. In this patient, ground-glass opacities had been noted on chest CT before his presentation with micro- scopic hematuria and subsequent cough. How- ever, he did not have rhinitis, sore throat, or malaise, which are typical symptoms of upper respiratory infection. There were no previous episodes of hematuria, and such episodes might be expected with IgA nephropathy. Likewise, there was no joint or abdominal pain, and such pain would be suggestive of Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura. The progression of his respiratory symptoms would not be characteristic of either IgA nephropathy or Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.\n\nANCA-Associated Vasculitis\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)\u2013 associated vasculitides include eosinophilic gran- ulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), granuloma- tosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Patients with EGPA, GPA, or MPA can have concurrent pulmonary and renal involvement.\nEGPA typically progresses through three stages. The first stage involves refractory atopic symp- toms, which are accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia in the second stage, and the final stage involves a systemic vasculitis that is her- alded by constitutional symptoms.1 This patient did not have symptoms or signs of concurrent, persistent, or refractory asthma. There were no nasal or sinus symptoms or findings suggestive of peripheral neuropathy, which are often ob-\n \nserved in patients with EGPA. In addition, there was no eosinophilia. Although the results of ANCA testing are not available, EGPA is unlikely to explain his presentation.\nThe patient did have several symptoms and signs that were consistent with GPA and MPA, including cough, dyspnea, and chest pain,  as well as proteinuria and hematuria. In addition, patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have an increased incidence of deep venous thrombo- sis, which could explain his pulmonary embo- lism.2 However, GPA and MPA would not be as- sociated with normal renal function, and both of these conditions typically develop in older adults. GPA and MPA remain possible diagnoses; re- sults of ANCA testing would be informative.\n\nAnti-GBM Disease\nAnti\u2013glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease can also cause pulmonary and renal disease. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies pro- duce pulmonary symptoms only after disruption of the alveolar endothelium occurs and the anti- bodies are permitted to access the alveolar base- ment membrane; thereafter, the inflammatory response mediates damage and disease. It is in- triguing that this patient\u2019s symptoms began after trauma to the chest wall, which could have caused injury to the alveolar endothelium. The history of vaping and recent episode of pneumo- nia are also potential risk factors for alveolar injury. The detection of protein, red cells, and white cells on urinalysis could be consistent with anti-GBM disease, although this disease is more likely to be associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with a fulminant course that results in rapid deterioration of kidney function. However, in an observational study involving patients with anti-GBM disease, milder renal in- volvement occurred in a higher percentage of pa- tients than expected.3 Anti-GBM disease remains a possible diagnosis, but the normal creatinine level decreases the likelihood of this condition.\n\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease of unknown cause. In this patient, the presence of microscopic hematuria and proteinuria in the context of multisystemic symptoms warrants consideration of SLE. His evolving respiratory symptoms would be consis- tent with SLE, which commonly results in pulmonary disease. His early chest pain and pleural effusion could be manifestations of pleuritis and serositis, respectively. SLE is associated with an increased risk of infection, given the associated leukopenia and hypocomplementemia, which could have conferred a predisposition to pneu- monia in this patient. Finally, the extensive pul- monary emboli found on admission in this pa- tient would be consistent with the predilection for thromboembolism among patients with SLE, especially those with concomitant antiphospho- lipid antibodies.\nAntiphospholipid syndrome can be a primary disorder or can occur in association with autoimmune diseases, such as SLE. The hallmark feature is a prothrombotic state that results in both arterial and venous thromboembolism. The patient\u2019s extensive pulmonary emboli invoke con- cern for such hypercoagulability. In addition, he had a history of migraines and possible Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, both of which are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome.\nOther aspects of this patient\u2019s presentation could also be attributed to SLE. On evaluation at this hospital, he had symptoms suggestive of psychosis, which could be neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE, including SLE involving the central nervous system (known as CNS lupus). Fatigue and loss of appetite are also common symptoms of SLE. The patient\u2019s absolute lym- phocyte count was less than 1500 cells per mi- croliter, a finding consistent with lymphopenia, which is often observed with SLE. In patients with SLE, anemia is often due to autoimmune hemolysis; this patient did not have an elevated bilirubin level, but a direct antiglobulin test (direct Coombs\u2019 test) would be helpful in ruling out hemolysis.\nAmerican College of Rheumatology criteria and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria can aid in the diagnosis of SLE.4,5 In this patient, it would be helpful to obtain levels of one or more of the following immunologic markers: antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, anti-Smith antibod- ies, antiphospholipid antibodies, or complement in serum. The SLICC criteria require at least one positive test for an immunologic marker. In the presence of ANAs or anti-dsDNA antibodies, results on renal biopsy that are compatible with lupus nephritis would be diagnostic of SLE, even in the absence of other clinical criteria.5 In this patient, renal biopsy would not only provide di- agnostic confirmation but also inform progno- sis and guide therapy.\nSLE is the diagnosis that is most likely to explain this patient\u2019s symptoms and findings. I suspect that the diagnostic test in this case was renal biopsy with immunofluorescence staining.\n",

Testing was posi- tive for lupus anticoagulant, ANAs (titer, 1:320), and anti-dsDNA antibodies (titer, 1:640), with a low C3 level (74 mg per deciliter; reference range, 81 to 157). Testing of a random urine sample revealed 1.1 mg of protein per 1.0 mg of creatinine (reference value, <0.2), and granular casts were observed on microscopic examination of the urinary sediment. The most likely diagno- sis was lupus nephritis. Because the proteinuria was not in the nephrotic range (i.e., the urinary protein level was <3.5 g per day)6 and the creati- nine level was normal, a highly active class III or IV lupus nephritis was unlikely. Percutaneous renal biopsy was performed.: The tissue from the core bi- opsy of the kidney was divided for light micros- copy, immunofluorescence staining, and electron microscopy. Light microscopy (Fig. 3A) revealed mild mesangial hypercellularity and  expansion of mesangial matrix, as well as thickening of the glomerular basement membrane without dupli- cation. Masson\u2019s trichrome staining revealed fuschinophilic subepithelial deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. Prominent pro- tein reabsorption droplets were seen within tu- bular epithelial cells. Endocapillary proliferation, glomerular necrosis, and crescent formation were not seen.",
