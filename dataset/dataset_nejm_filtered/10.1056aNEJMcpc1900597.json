    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Priya Srikanth (Neurology): A 31-year-old woman was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of vision loss.\nThree weeks before presentation, blurry vision in the left eye developed gradu- ally, with perception of distant objects most affected; the patient attributed this change to needing new eyeglasses. One week before presentation, the patient re- ported nearly complete loss of vision in the left eye, with a \u201cdark shadow\u201d located in the center of vision. The peripheral vision was unaffected. Colors were increas- ingly \u201cwashed out,\u201d and images appeared gray. When she covered her left eye, the vision in her right eye was normal. She recalled intermittent floaters in the left eye that had correlated with the onset of vision loss. The patient was evaluated by her local optometrist. Central vision loss was confirmed, and no abnormalities were seen on funduscopic examination. She was referred to a neuro-ophthalmologist. However, her symptoms continued to progress, and she sought care at a hospital that is affiliated with this hospital and specializes in ophthalmology.\nIn the emergency department of the affiliated hospital, the temperature was\n36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the blood pressure 118/81 mm Hg, the re- spiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.4. A central scotoma was noted in the left eye; the visual field was full in the right eye. Visual acuity was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. On the Ishihara color test, 8 of 13 color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the right eye and 0 of 13 color plates were identified correctly in the visual field of the left eye. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light; a relative afferent pupillary defect was noted in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination of the eyes revealed normal adnexa, lids, lashes, conjunctivae, and sclerae and clear corneas. The anterior chambers, irises, lenses, and vitreous bodies were normal in both eyes. The intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye. The optic nerves were pink, with normal cups and sharp margins. The vessels ap- peared normal in both eyes. Extraocular move- ments were normal bilaterally, without nystagmus. Imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Amy F. Juliano: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits was performed be- fore and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. A T2-weighted image showed increased signal with probable mild hazy enhance- ment in the left optic nerve; there was no evi- dence of a mass lesion compressing the optic nerve or cerebral white-matter lesions (Fig. 1).\nDr. Srikanth: The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation. She reported that her vision was unchanged from 3 weeks earlier and that she had intermittent dull pain under the left eye. There was no double vision, pain with eye move- ment, or history of ocular trauma. She did not have fevers, chills, numbness, tingling, weakness, lack of coordination, hearing loss, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. She had a history of vitamin D and iron deficiencies; she had not undergone any surgeries. She had no known adverse reactions to medications and was taking no medications. The patient lived alone in a suburb in New England. She was in a long- term relationship with a male partner and had no children. She drank alcohol occasionally but did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. There was no history of recent travel, insect or tick bites, or cats in her home. Her grandfather had hyper- lipidemia. Her mother had a history of glaucoma, but no other family members had a history of vision loss.\nThe vital signs and results of the ophthalmo- logic examination were unchanged, and the remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, vitamin B12,\nC-reactive protein, thyrotropin, and  angiotensin-converting enzyme were normal, as were the re- sults of tests of renal and liver function, the complete blood count, the differential count, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 19 ng per milliliter (47 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per milliliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]). An assay for antinuclear antibodies was positive at 1:40 with a speckled pattern; assays for anti\u2013 double-stranded DNA, anti\u2013aquaporin-4, and anti\u2013myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein anti- bodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. Antibody-based screening tests for Lyme disease and syphilis were negative, as were blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2. Admission to the neurology service was recom- mended for additional evaluation and the admin- istration of empirical intravenous glucocorticoid therapy; however, the patient declined admission and chose instead to have follow-up in the clinic. Nine days later, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported increased blurriness of the nasal visual field of the left eye. The results of the ophthalmologic examination were unchanged. Human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable in the blood. A 3-day outpatient course of intravenous glucocorti- coids was begun, and a subsequent 14-day taper-\ning course of prednisone was prescribed.\nThirty-four days after evaluation in the emergency department and 2 months after blurry vi- sion in the left eye had developed, vision loss in the right eye developed. Three days later, the pa- tient was evaluated in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic of the affiliated hospital. She reported that there had been mild improvement in visual acuity after treatment with glucocorticoids, but it was brief and transient. Visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. On the Ishihara color test, only the control plate was identified correctly, a finding that indicated com- plete color blindness in both eyes. There was mild anisocoria and a trace relative afferent pu- pillary defect in the left eye. The results of exter- nal and slit-lamp examinations of the eyes were unchanged. The left optic-nerve disk was pallid; funduscopic examination of both eyes was other- wise normal. The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for fur- ther evaluation and treatment.\nOn admission, the results of the ophthalmo- logic examination were unchanged from those obtained in the neuro-ophthalmology clinic, and the neurologic examination was normal. Blood levels of folate, thiamine, and copper were nor- mal; anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies were not detected in the blood. Additional imaging studies were performed.\nDr. Juliano: MRI of the head, orbits, cervical spine, and thoracic spine was performed before and after the administration of intravenous con- trast material. A T2-weighted image showed mild, asymmetric increase in signal with enhancement in the left optic nerve and equivocal increase in signal without definite abnormal enhancement in the retrobulbar segment of the right optic nerve; there was no evidence of cerebral white- matter lesions or spinal-cord abnormalities.\nDr. Srikanth: A lumbar puncture was performed, and the opening pressure was 17 cm of water. Gram\u2019s staining of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells; no neutrophils or organisms were identi- fied. Other results of CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. Intravenous glucocorticoids were ad- ministered for 3 days, but vision loss persisted. Three days after the lumbar puncture, culture of the CSF showed no growth and cytologic exami- nation of the CSF revealed no malignant cells. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was dis- charged home.\nFour days after discharge, the patient wasevaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported no improvement in her vision, and the results of the examination were unchanged. A diagnostic test was performed.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Marcelo Matiello: This previously healthy young woman had subacute, sequential bilateral vision loss without other neurologic abnormalities. Like many patients, she initially attributed the subacute vision deficits to a need for new eye- glasses and postponed seeking medical treat- ment until she had severe monocular vision loss. The first step in the evaluation of this pa- tient\u2019s vision loss is anatomical localization of the disease process in the visual pathway. Persis- tent monocular vision loss localizes to either the eye structures or the portion of the optic nerve anterior to the optic chiasm.\nDoes the presence of a relative afferent pupil- lary defect in this patient help with anatomical localization? In a patient with normal function of the optic nerves, light directed at either eye will cause the same amount of constriction in both pupils. In a patient with unilateral dysfunc- tion of the optic nerve anterior to the optic chiasm, light directed at the affected eye will cause only mild constriction of both pupils because of a decreased response to light from the afferent defect, whereas light directed at the unaffected eye will cause normal constriction of both pupils. Swinging the light back and forth between the two eyes accentuates this difference, with both pupils appearing to dilate when the light is swung from the unaffected eye to the affected eye. Ocular diseases \u2014 such as corneal abnormali- ties, cataracts, and most retinal disorders \u2014 do not cause a relative afferent pupillary defect.1\nSeveral other features of this patient\u2019s presentation, including color desaturation and central vision deficits, suggest involvement of the optic nerve. In addition, the severity of this patient\u2019s vision loss is consistent with optic neuropathy. \nOptic Neuropathy\nAfter the disease process is localized to the optic nerve, determining the tempo of vision loss may help to narrow the differential diagnosis. This patient had painless subacute optic neuropathy. Ischemic and traumatic causes of optic neuropathy are hyperacute and can be easily ruled out in this case. Chronic causes of optic neuropathy\u2014such as cancer, toxin exposure, and vitamin deficiencies \u2014 are unlikely. I will focus on the imaging findings, the results of tests for infec- tion and autoimmune disease, and the lack of a response to glucocorticoids to narrow my differ- ential diagnosis.\nInfection\nInfections such as bartonellosis, tuberculosis, and cytomegalovirus infection can affect the optic nerve, but they predominantly involve the retina and cause neuroretinitis rather than iso- lated optic neuropathy.2 In addition, tests for syphilis, Lyme disease, and HIV infection were negative, making an infectious cause of the pa- tient\u2019s symptoms unlikely.\nIsolated Optic Neuritis\nThe most common form of optic neuropathy is optic neuritis, which is an immune-mediated neurologic disease that produces inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve. Most pa- tients with optic neuritis have prominent pain that is often induced by eye movements. The pain is thought to result from extension of the inflammatory process to the pain-sensitive meningeal sheath of the optic nerve and pos- sibly to the extraocular muscles. Optic neuritis can occur in isolation, in either a monophasic or a relapsing course. However, it is commonly a harbinger of other illnesses, such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or less common diseases.3\n\nMultiple Sclerosis\nVision loss due to optic neuritis is a common first presentation in patients who ultimately re- ceive a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. However, the severity of this patient\u2019s vision loss and the lack of a response to glucocorticoids make mul- tiple sclerosis unlikely. More than two thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis have only mild- to-moderate loss of visual acuity or color percep- tion. Moreover, most patients with multiple sclerosis\u2013related optic neuritis have complete or nearly complete vision recovery after the admin- istration of glucocorticoids. Finally, this patient\u2019s normal results on MRI of the head and the ab- sence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF make the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis unlikely.4\n\nNeuromyelitis Optica\nNeuromyelitis optica is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system with a predilec- tion for the optic nerves, spinal cord, and area postrema in the brain stem. Up to 20% of pa- tients present with bilateral or rapidly relapsing optic neuritis that tends to be more fulminant\n \nand associated with a worse visual prognosis than multiple sclerosis\u2013related optic neuritis. More than 80% of patients with neuromyelitis optica\u2013related optic neuritis have visual acuity worse than 20/200. However, patients with neuro- myelitis optica typically have extensive changes consistent with inflammation of the optic nerve on MRI, which were not present in this case. Of note, this patient tested negative for the highly sensitive and specific antibodies to aquaporin-4 water channels, which are found in approximate- ly 80% of patients with neuromyelitis optica.5\n\nMyelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein\u2013 Mediated Optic Neuritis\nSevere optic neuritis may be caused by the aber- rant production of antibodies to myelin oligoden- drocyte glycoprotein. However, like patients with neuromyelitis optica\u2013related optic neuritis, pa- tients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein\u2013 mediated optic neuritis typically have striking findings on MRI and a dramatic therapeutic re- sponse to high-dose glucocorticoids. This patient tested negative for antibodies to myelin oligoden- drocyte glycoprotein, a finding that does not rule out this diagnosis but makes it very unlikely.6\n\nParaneoplastic Syndromes\nThis patient was not known to have cancer, but in rare circumstances, bilateral optic neuropathy can be the initial manifestation of a paraneo- plastic process. The mechanism of optic-nerve dysfunction in paraneoplastic disease is thought to be inflammatory, but there is typically a mild or no response to glucocorticoid treatment. How- ever, paraneoplastic optic neuropathy most com- monly occurs in conjunction with cranial neu- ropathies, peripheral or autonomic neuropathy, ataxia, dementia, or neuromuscular-junction dis- orders, such as the Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome, and this patient had no associated neurologic symptoms.\n\nSarcoidosis\nSarcoidosis leads to vision abnormalities in ap- proximately 25% of patients with systemic disease; anterior uveitis is most common, but iso- lated optic neuritis may also occur. In contrast with other inflammatory causes of optic neuri- tis, sarcoidosis may be associated with mild pain and slow disease progression, features that were noted in this patient. The normal angio-tensin-converting\u2013enzyme level does not rule out the possibility of sarcoidosis in this patient. Glucocorticoid treatment usually leads to sub-stantial improvement in vision, but this outcome is not universal. However, patients with acute sarcoid optic neuropathy typically have enlargement of the optic nerve, dural thickening, or leptomeningeal enhancement on gadolinium- enhanced MRI, and none of these findings were present in this case.\n\nLeber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy\nLeber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) causes painless, subacute, severe vision loss in one eye, followed by vision loss in the contralateral eye within several weeks or months.8 LHON was the first human disease linked to a mutation in mito- chondrial DNA; it is more common in men than in women and typically occurs between 15 and 35 years of age. This patient did not have a fam- ily history suggestive of LHON, but up to 50% of affected patients do not have a family history of vision loss. Patients with LHON have severe vision loss,  with  visual  acuity  worse  than  20/200  in both eyes. Since inflammation is not driving the process, the administration of glucocorticoids does not lead to improvement. MRI typically shows only hyperintensity in the posterior por- tion of the optic nerve, but enhancement of the optic nerve has been reported during the acute phase.9 LHON best explains this patient\u2019s clini- cal course, the negative tests, and the lack of a response to glucocorticoid therapy. To establish this diagnosis, I would obtain genetic studies to look for point mutations in mitochondrial DNA that are known to be associated with LHON.\nClinical Impression\nDr. Michael Bowley: This young woman presented with bilateral central vision loss and dyschroma- topsia, and findings on examination were indica- tive of a disorder of the anterior visual pathway, specifically the optic nerves. Autoimmune causes were the main concern, given her age and sex. However, serologic, imaging, and CSF studies were unrevealing. Because she had painless cen- tral vision loss that developed sequentially in the two eyes over a period of weeks to months and did not improve with time or with the administration of empirical glucocorticoid therapy, a diagnosis of LHON was considered. Genetic testing for the point mutations in the mitochon- drial genome that are known to most com- monly cause LHON was performed.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Amel Karaa: LHON is a maternally inherited mitochondrial disorder that is caused primarily by mutations in mitochondrial genes encoding the NADH dehydrogenase subunits and that causes decreased activity of complex 1 of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.10,11 Three mutations account for more than 95% of cases of LHON: m.11778G\u2192A (the most common), m.3460G\u2192A, and m.14484T\u2192C. These mutations all ultimately lead to decreased ATP produc- tion.11,12 Most LHON-related mutations are homo- plasmic, and thus testing of mitochondrial DNA in the blood is a suitable method for diagnosis. Such testing can involve either targeted analysis of mitochondrial DNA for the most common LHON-related missense mutations or full genome sequencing of mitochondrial DNA.\nGiven the high level of suspicion for LHON in\nthis patient, targeted analysis of mitochondrial DNA was performed, and it confirmed the pres- ence of the m.14484T\u2192C mutation. This specific mutation is thought to have reduced penetrance and has been associated with spontaneous par- tial recovery of visual acuity.11,12 LHON-related mutations are more likely to occur in males than in females, at ratios of 2.1:1.0 to 7.7:1.0.11 How- ever, the mutations alone are not sufficient to cause the disease, and other genetic modifiers (mitochondrial DNA copy number, haplotype, and nuclear modifiers), environmental factors (tobacco, alcohol, and toxin exposure), and sex hormone levels probably play a role in the patho- physiology.13-15 In patients with LHON, a com- bination of these factors is thought to cause an increase in free radicals, a decrease in ATP production, and a disruption in the oxidation\u2013 reduction (redox) balance, ultimately leading to retinal ganglion-cell apoptosis and optic-nerve degeneration.15,16\nThis patient did not have any extraocular neurologic symptoms, such as a movement dis- order, white-matter changes on MRI, weakness, sensory loss, lactic acidosis, or other common symptoms of mitochondrial disease. The pres- ence of these extraocular symptoms in addition to vision loss is referred to as LHON plus.\n\n",
