    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Giovanna S. Manzano (Neurology): A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with cognitive impairment, headache, and memory loss.\nThe patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respira- tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient\u2019s performance at work. The pa- tient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forget- ting her personal passwords.\nThe patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time\n\u2014 including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes \u2014 was unremarkable. The patient was re- ferred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation.\nOne week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed sud- denly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the ad- ministration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain.\nThree weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic af- filiated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell \u201cworld\u201d backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An elec- troencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity. Topiramate was prescribed for a working diagnosis of complex migraine. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed. T2- weighted f luid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images showed diffusely scattered hy- perintensities in the periventricular, subcortical, and deep white matter and leptomeningeal en- hancement. In addition, there was evidence of frontal superficial siderosis and a few scattered microhemorrhages.\nDr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was also per- formed. On cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, the white-cell count was 46 per microliter (refer- ence range, 0 to 5), with a lymphocyte count of 99% (reference range, 40 to 80), the red-cell count was 35 per microliter (reference value, 0), and the protein level was 221 mg per deciliter (reference range, 13 to 40); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the CSF were negative. The administration of topiramate was stopped; treatment with oral doxycycline was started but then was stopped after 5 days, when results of a test for Borrelia burgdorferi were inter- preted as negative.\nOver the next 3 weeks, intermittent headache\npersisted and cognitive impairment worsened. The patient presented to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital. She was unable to provide a history. According to the patient\u2019s husband, the patient had stopped working and was no longer able to effectively care for herself, requir- ing assistance with daily activities such as bath- ing, dressing, and eating. She had difficulty planning and was unable to put on clothes in the correct sequence or to turn on the shower. Memory impairment persisted, conversation was tangential, and visual hallucinations frequently occurred. The patient had lost 6.8 kg in the past month. There was no fever, rash, or joint pain.\nThe patient had a history of poliomyelitis in\nchildhood, with residual mild weakness in the left leg; vitamin B12 deficiency, which had been corrected; and hypothyroidism. Medications included atorvastatin, levothyroxine, sertraline, vita- min B12, and cholecalciferol. She had a known allergy to amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate with an  unknown reaction. She was a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, and she had consumed four alcoholic beverages per week before the onset of the current illness. The patient worked in a health care clinic and lived with her hus- band in a suburban area of New England. She had not traveled outside the United States. She was an avid gardener; she had a dog but no other animal exposures. Her father had received a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at 62 years of age.\nOn examination, the patient was alert and interactive. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 105/51 mm Hg, the heart rate 56 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while she was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 32.4. The patient was oriented to time, place, and person. Her speech was fluent, with intact naming, rep- etition, and comprehension. She had impaired abstraction and mildly impaired attention. She was unable to recall three objects after a delay. Intermittently during the examination, she had visual hallucinations that she knew were not real. Cranial nerve examination was unremark- able. Strength was 5/5 throughout, except in the left  leg  (4/5).  Reflexes  were  brisk  throughout, including 3+ reflexes in the arms and the right lower leg; pectoralis reflexes and a jaw jerk were present. No ankle clonus was noted. Examina- tions for tone, sensation, and cerebellar function were unremarkable. The remainder of the exami- nation was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Gonzalez: MRI of the head was performed\n(Fig. 1). FLAIR images showed slight progres- sion of the diffuse subarachnoid hyperintensi- ties and leptomeningeal enhancement. Suscepti- bility-weighted images showed frontal superficial siderosis and scattered lobar microhemorrhages. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head revealed patent cranial vessels, without evidence of aneurysm, arteriovenous malforma- tion, or thrombosis. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen, obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was normal.\nDr. Manzano: Lumbar puncture was performed. On CSF analysis, the nucleated-cell count was 28 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), the lym- phocyte count 85%, the red-cell count 53 per microliter, and the protein level 280 mg per deciliter. CSF was sent for culture and cytologic studies; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An EEG was normal.\nThe patient was admitted to this hospital, and intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and meth- ylprednisolone were administered. During the first 48 hours, the patient was agitated and im- pulsive. Visual hallucinations worsened, and olanzapine was administered. The CSF culture was negative, and the CSF cytologic studies showed no malignant cells.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Shamik Bhattacharyya: When approaching the differential diagnosis in a complex case such as this one, I start by naming the clinical syndrome as a broad category and then consider the poten- tial underlying causes.\n\nClinical Syndrome\nThis patient\u2019s initial neurologic symptoms were cognitive. She had declining performance at work and forgot computer passwords. These mild symptoms progressed to disorientation and inattention, as indicated by the inability to per- form serial sevens calculations. This cognitive deterioration can be broadly described with the term \u201cencephalopathy,\u201d which implies brain parenchymal dysfunction. Selective networks of cognition could have been affected, with spe- cific neuroanatomical localization; for example, frontal executive dysfunction could have caused difficulty operating a computer. However, we do not have results from a detailed neurocognitive examination obtained early in this patient\u2019s dis- ease course, so we cannot be more specific.\nThe patient\u2019s second set of clinical symptoms\n\u2014 including severe headache, nausea, and blurred vision \u2014 is associated with meningeal irritation and improved with treatment. Finally, the patient had evidence of inflammation, including the sub- acute evolution of the syndrome over a period of weeks, the presence of pleocytosis on CSF analy- sis, and the presence of gadolinium enhance- ment on MRI of the head. If we tie together the findings of encephalopathy, meningeal irrita- tion, and inflammation, the clinical syndrome is consistent with meningoencephalitis.\n\nMeningoencephalitis\nFinding a specific cause of meningoencephalitis can be a difficult clinical task, often requiring the integration of history, risk factors, and re- sults from multiple testing techniques, rather than reliance on a single testing strategy. No single test or panel of tests is comprehensive enough to identify all or even most causes of encephalitis. For example, in a prospective series involving patients with meningitis and encepha- litis who were evaluated clinically and with metagenomic sequencing of CSF for infectious diseases, approximately 50% of cases had no specific cause identified.1 This finding parallels results of earlier studies, in which a substantial fraction of encephalitis cases did not have a clearly identifiable cause.2,3 When I consider causes of meningoencephalitis, I first divide them into infectious and noninfectious causes.\n\nInfectious Causes\nThe list of infections that could potentially lead to encephalitis is long and can be narrowed in this case by considering the patient\u2019s risk factors and exposure history. The patient was not known to be immunocompromised, and she did\n \n\nnot have a history of travel outside the north- eastern United States. The most commonly iden- tified cause of acute encephalitis in older adults is herpes simplex virus encephalitis, which typi- cally involves the temporal lobes.4,5 Features in this patient that argue against this diagnosis are the relatively slow pace of evolution (over a pe- riod of weeks, rather than days), the absence of fever, and the absence of temporal lobe involve- ment on MRI.\nThe most common type of arboviral meningo- encephalitis in the northeastern United States is West Nile virus encephalitis, with rarer types including Powassan virus encephalitis and east- ern equine encephalitis.6 The time course of this patient\u2019s illness is more indolent than would be expected with these infections. Characteristic imaging features of arboviral encephalitis, in- cluding involvement of the deep gray matter, cerebellum, and brain stem, were absent in this case.7 Varicella\u2013zoster virus, which notoriously causes variable forms of encephalitis, remains a possibility.8\nThis patient had disparate results of Lyme\ndisease testing, with a positive CSF test showing IgG and IgM bands but with a negative blood test. In testing for Lyme disease, a serologic test of the blood for antibodies to B. burgdorferi is performed first, and then a CSF test is per- formed if indicated on the basis of signs and symptoms.9 This patient had no detectable Lyme disease antibodies in the blood, and therefore, the relevance of positive bands on CSF testing is unclear. Although meningoencephalitis can be caused by Lyme disease, this patient did not have rash, arthritis, or radiculitis, features that would further suggest the diagnosis of Lyme disease. In addition, false positive results of CSF sero- logic testing for Lyme disease in patients with- out any signs of neuroborreliosis can occur.10\nTuberculosis can cause subacute meningoencephalitis. However, this infection is not common in the northeastern United States, and the absence of fever and the negative inter- feron-gamma release assay make it an unlikely diagnosis in this case.11 Cryptococcal infection can cause subacute meningoencephalitis in an immunocompetent person. However, the CSF cryptococcal antigen test is highly sensitive for cryptococcal disease and was negative in this patient.\nNoninfectious Causes\nImmune-mediated noninfectious causes of me- ningoencephalitis can result in subacute neuro- logic syndromes that affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The rapidly emerg- ing knowledge about these syndromes can be overwhelming, given that new disease-causing antineural antibodies targeting obscure antigens are discovered and reported frequently. As with infectious causes of meningoencephalitis, a sys- tematic approach to noninfectious causes, focus- ing on risk factors, may help in finding a cause and proposing a treatment.\nIn the United States, demyelinating diseases\nare the most common autoimmune neurologic disorders of the brain, and they should be con- sidered in this case. Multiple sclerosis is un- likely in this patient because of the absence of typical demyelinating lesions on MRI of the head, the absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF, and the presence of headache, which is an atypical symptom in patients with multiple scle- rosis.13,14 Among related demyelinating disor- ders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and anti\u2013myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein syn- drome can cause subacute meningoencephalitis, but MRI typically shows multifocal cortical and subcortical hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging, which were not present in this patient.15 Neurosarcoidosis is less rare than previously thought, and in approximately 50% of cases, neurologic symptoms are the first manifesta- tion.16 Subclinical evidence of extraneural sar- coidosis, such as mediastinal lymphadenopathy, is often present on further investigation, even in cases in which neurologic symptoms predomi- nate. A potentially helpful clue on MRI is the presence of tortuous deep medullary veins on gadolinium-enhanced and susceptibility-weight- ed imaging.17 Although CT of the chest and ab- domen in this patient did not show enlarged lymph nodes and MRI of the head did not show tortuous deep medullary veins, neurosarcoidosis\nremains a possible diagnosis in this patient.\nThe other causes of noninfectious meningo- encephalitis can be broadly grouped under the rubric of autoimmune encephalitis. Consensus clinical criteria for autoimmune encephalitis have been proposed, and this patient meets cri- teria for possible autoimmune encephalitis on the basis of progressive neuropsychiatric chang-\n \nes over a period of less than 3 months, CSF pleocytosis, and the absence of a clear alterna- tive explanation.18 When considering possible causes of autoimmune encephalitis, I pose the following seven questions.\nFirst, is the patient\u2019s syndrome consistent with limbic encephalitis? Inflammation in the limbic regions of the brain causes subacute deficits in memory, personality changes, and seizures. Encephalitis associated with antibodies to leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 is a common type of limbic encephalitis in older adults, and hyponatremia may be a diagnostic clue.19 In this patient, the abnormalities on MRI of the head were present in meningeal and extratemporal regions, rather than in limbic regions such as the medial temporal lobes, as would be expected with limbic encephalitis.18\nSecond, is the syndrome consistent with en-\ncephalitis associated with antibodies to N-methyl- d-aspartate receptors? This is one of the most common causes of autoimmune encephalitis in younger patients, but it is an important diagno- sis to consider in all age groups.20 However, this patient did not have the characteristic progres- sion of neuropsychiatric changes to seizures with speech disturbances, a movement disorder, decreased arousal, and dysautonomia.21\nThird, does the patient have cancer or sys- temic autoimmune disease? Cancer can directly invade the nervous system or cause paraneoplas- tic inflammatory injury. This patient did not have a known cancer, either noted in her history or discovered during the current evaluation. She had hypothyroidism, which is often due to im- mune-mediated injury to the thyroid gland. Hashimoto encephalopathy, also known as steroid- responsive encephalopathy associated with auto- immune thyroiditis, is a form of encephalitis associated with the presence of antithyroid per- oxidase or antithyroglobulin antibodies. The clinical presentation includes progressive confu- sion and decreased consciousness, and results of MRI of the head are usually normal or nonspe- cific.22 Although this patient\u2019s clinical course could be consistent with Hashimoto encepha- lopathy, testing for antithyroid peroxidase anti- bodies was negative, and the abnormal gado- linium enhancement on MRI of the head points away from this diagnosis.\nFourth, is the syndrome consistent with Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease? Rapidly progressive cognitive impairment in an older adult is sug- gestive of this prion-mediated neurodegenerative disease. A movement disorder, especially myoc- lonus, is common and was not present in this patient. In addition, CSF pleocytosis and the absence of typical restricted diffusion in the cortex and striatal regions on MRI argue against a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease.23\nFifth, is the patient\u2019s syndrome consistent with primary central nervous system (CNS) vas- culitis? Although this diagnosis is often invoked, primary CNS vasculitis is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence of approximately 2 cases per 1 million person-years.24 The disease is difficult to diagnose; there is no definitive combination of history, examination, imaging, and laboratory features specific enough to establish the diagno- sis without histopathological proof. Patients with primary CNS vasculitis can present with head- ache, neuropsychiatric changes, and meningeal gadolinium enhancement on MRI, so this pos- sibility should remain on the differential diag- nosis in this case.\nSixth, is the syndrome caused by cerebral\namyloid angiopathy (CAA)\u2013related inflammation? In an adult 40 years of age or older, this condi- tion usually manifests as a subacute syndrome with headache, progressive behavioral changes, and a decrease in consciousness.25 MRI usually shows lesions involving the subcortical white matter, as well as hemorrhagic lesions (cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral microbleeds, or cortical superficial siderosis). In this patient, MRI re- vealed multiple microhemorrhages in a lobar distribution, cortical siderosis, and subtle corti- cal hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging, features that are all consistent with the diagno- sis of CAA-related inflammation.\nFinally, does the patient have CNS lymphoma? Lymphoma can mimic multiple diseases and can affect both the meninges and the brain parenchyma. This patient primarily had evidence of leptomeningeal disease on imaging, without parenchymal masses. Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma occurs infrequently, accounting for less than 10% of primary CNS lymphomas.26 Furthermore, approximately two thirds of pa- tients with primary leptomeningeal lymphoma have malignant cells on CSF cytologic studies, which were not identified in this patient.\nNo single clue from the history, imaging studies, or laboratory test results in this case is specific for a diagnosis, and I suspect that a brain and meningeal biopsy was ultimately re- quired to establish a pathological diagnosis and direct treatment. Reasonable diagnostic possi- bilities include varicella\u2013zoster virus meningo- encephalitis, neurosarcoidosis, primary CNS vas- culitis, and CAA-related inflammation. Because of the presence of multiple hemorrhagic lesions in the brain on MRI, I think that CAA-related inflammation is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Samantha N. Champion: A surgical biopsy of the right frontal cortex was performed. Examination of the biopsy specimen revealed sections of cere- bral cortex with moderate subpial gliosis and scattered acellular granular basophilic aggre- gates suggestive of amyloid plaques (Fig. 2A). The overlying leptomeninges showed acute hem- orrhage with focal deposition of fibrin; an area of cellular arachnoid contained medium-sized vessels with thickened eosinophilic walls (some with splitting), chronic inflammatory cells, and hemosiderin deposition (Fig. 2A and 2B).\nImmunohistochemical staining for amyloid-\nbeta protein showed a moderate burden of amy- loid plaques, rare neuritic plaques, rare amyloid deposition in small parenchymal vessels, and de- position in several leptomeningeal vessels with associated inflammation (Fig. 2C). Immunohisto- chemical stains for inflammatory markers showed that the inflammatory component was predominantly composed of CD3+ T cells (Fig. 2D) with scattered CD20+ B cells. An immu- nohistochemical stain for varicella\u2013zoster virus was negative.\nCAA-related inflammation is an autoimmune reaction to amyloid-beta deposits in the cerebral vasculature.27 Diagnostic criteria include evi- dence of at least one CAA-positive vessel that shows lymphocytes in the vessel wall or perivascular histiocytes without associated hemosider- in, since bland perivascular lymphocytes or peri- vascular macrophages with associated hemosiderin can be present with sporadic CAA.25 In this case, there was no evidence of vessel-wall destruction or multinucleated giant cells, findings that are normally present with amyloid-beta\u2013related angi- itis.28 Therefore, given the presence of leptomen- ingeal CAA and a prominent leptomeningeal perivascular inflammatory component without evidence of a destructive vasculitis or multinu- cleated giant cells, the features are most consis- tent with the diagnosis of CAA-related inflammation.\n\nFigure 2. Biopsy Specimens of the Right Frontal Cortex.\nOn hematoxylin and eosin staining of sections of formalin\u2011fixed and paraffin\u2011embedded tissue (Panels A and B), the cerebral cortex shows moderate subpial gliosis and the overlying leptomeninges show medium\u2011sized vessels with thickened eosinophilic walls (Panel A, arrow) and surrounding chronic inflammation (Panel A, arrowheads), as well as areas with vascular wall splitting (Panel B, arrow) and perivascular hemosiderin deposition (Panel B, arrowheads). Immunohistochemical staining for amyloid\u2011beta (Panel C) shows a moderate amount of diffuse am\u2011 yloid plaques (arrowheads), rare mature neuritic plaques (asterisk), rare amyloid deposition in small parenchymal vessels (arrow), and deposition in several leptomeningeal vessels (inset). Immunohistochemical staining for in\u2011\nflammatory markers (Panel D) shows that the leptomeningeal inflammation is predominantly composed of CD3+ T cells.\n",
