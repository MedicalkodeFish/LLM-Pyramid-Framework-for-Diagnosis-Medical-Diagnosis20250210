    "Primary Symptom": "A 52-Year-Old Woman with Fever and Rash after Heart Transplantation",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Taylor A. Lebeis: A 52-year-old woman who had undergone orthotopic heart trans- plantation because of dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted to this hospital with painful red lesions on the left arm and leg.\nEight years before this admission, the patient had ongoing episodes of pain in the chest and left arm, as well as occasional palpitations. She was initially seen at another hospital; electrocardiography and a stress test were performed, and the results were reportedly abnormal. She was referred to the cardiology clinic at this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn examination in the cardiology clinic, the pulse was 83 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 92/60 mm Hg; the remainder of the examination was nor- mal. Blood levels of electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, ferritin, and lipids were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natri- uretic peptide was 536 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 450). Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern, and a test for rheumatoid factor was negative. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with poor R-wave progression, left anterior fascicular block, and frequent premature ventricular contractions. A pharmacologic stress test revealed excellent exercise capacity and a small, fixed region of inferolateral ischemia. Echocardiog- raphy revealed left ventricular dilatation with diffuse hypokinesis, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 37%, and mild mitral regurgitation. Coronary angiography was recommended but declined by the patient; computed tomography (CT) of the chest with angiographic imaging of the coronary vessels did not reveal radiographically significant plaque or stenosis in the coronary arteries. Metoprolol tartrate, lisinopril, pravastatin, and aspirin were prescribed.\nDuring the next year, the episodes of arm pain ceased but palpitations per-\nsisted. A 48-hour Holter monitoring recording showed frequent ventricular ectopic activity without ventricular tachycardia. Five years before this admission, echocardiography revealed that the estimated left ven- tricular ejection fraction had decreased to 30%, and an automatic implantable cardioverter\u2013defi- brillator was placed.\nFour years before this admission, the patient began to have frequent hospital admissions be- cause of dyspnea and volume overload. Echocar- diography revealed progressive left ventricular dilatation, an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 21%, severe mitral regurgitation, and a right ventricular systolic pressure of 75 mm Hg. Three years before this admission, the patient underwent surgical mitral-valve repair with place- ment of a mechanical-valve prosthesis, after which her dyspnea improved.\nOne year before this admission, the patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital because of a 1-hour history of palpita- tions, light-headedness, chest pressure, nausea, and fatigue; an evaluation revealed ventricular tachycardia with cardiogenic shock. Ventricular tachycardia abated with the administration of intravenous amiodarone and external electrical cardioversion, but shock persisted. Continuous infusions of norepinephrine and milrinone were administered, and an intravascular microaxial blood pump was placed. Before discharge, a left ventricular assist device was placed. During the procedure, a core excision of the left ventricular apex was performed.\nDr. Lucas R. Massoth: Histopathological exami-\nnation of the excised myocardium revealed ac- tive, necrotizing myocarditis with an infiltrate composed primarily of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and histiocytes, along with scattered plasma cells and mast cells (Fig. 1A). Hypertrophic car- diac myocytes were present. Trichrome staining revealed severe interstitial fibrosis (Fig. 1B).\nDr. Lebeis: An evaluation to determine eligi- bility for cardiac transplantation was initiated. Routine blood screening detected IgG antibod- ies to Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid anti- gen and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Additional screening was positive for IgG antibodies to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and hepatitis A virus, as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) sur- face antibodies; these findings indicate either previous infection or vaccine-induced immunity. Serologic screening was negative for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Nucleic-acid testing\n \nwas negative for HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HIV type 1 RNA. Panel-reactive antibody levels were elevated, with profiles showing a high degree of HLA sensitization. Four months before this ad- mission, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) infusions and rituximab were administered for desensitization, and plasmapheresis was per- formed in anticipation of transplantation.\nForty days before this admission, the patient was admitted for orthotopic heart transplanta- tion. The donor had a history of substance use disorder and had recently acquired tattoos. Test- ing of the donor blood revealed IgG antibodies to EBV viral capsid antigen; serologic testing was nonreactive for antibodies to CMV, T. gondii,\nT. pallidum, HIV types 1 and 2, and HCV, and ad- ditional testing was negative for HBV surface antigen, HBV core antibodies, HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and HIV type 1 RNA. During the opera- tion, packed red cells, fresh-frozen plasma, and platelets were transfused, and methylpredniso- lone, mycophenolate mofetil, vancomycin, and levofloxacin were administered.\nDr. Massoth: Gross examination of the heart explant revealed cardiomegaly and marked left ventricular dilatation (Fig. 1C and 1D). Histo- pathological evaluation was remarkable for dif- fuse, active myocarditis with a lymphocyte-pre- dominant infiltrate (Fig. 1E). There were numerous histiocytes, which occasionally formed areas of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 1F). One discrete noncaseating granuloma was identified. There were fewer eosinophils in the heart explant than in the initial core excision specimen, but the degree of inter- stitial fibrosis was similar in the two specimens. Coronary artery disease was negligible.\nDr. Lebeis: After transplantation, the patient had\na positive B-cell f low-cytometric cross-match; rabbit antithymocyte globulin and IVIG were ad- ministered, and plasmapheresis was performed. Oral prednisone, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, valgan- ciclovir, and nystatin were prescribed. Weekly biopsies of the right ventricular endomyocardi- um were performed; no signs of acute cellular rejection were seen on histopathological exami- nation. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 15.\nTwenty-three days after transplantation (17 days before this admission), the patient was seen in the emergency department of this hospital be cause of pain in the legs. On examination, the legs were diffusely tender without edema. Ultra- sonography of the legs revealed occlusive deep- vein thromboses of the gastrocnemius veins on both sides. CT of the chest with pulmonary an- giography, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a small left pleural effusion with associated subsegmental atelectasis in the left lower lobe and no pul- monary embolus. Subcutaneous injections of enoxaparin sodium were prescribed.\nTwenty-eight days after transplantation (12 days before this admission), the patient had an episode of cellular rejection, as diagnosed on examination of a biopsy specimen obtained dur- ing catheterization of the right side of the heart, which was performed as part of routine post- transplantation screening for early rejection. The episode was treated with an increase in immuno- suppression.\nOn the day of this admission, the patient was seen for follow-up in the cardiology clinic. She reported that 5 days earlier, a circular patch of erythema and warmth (10 cm in diameter) had developed on the left lower leg, and on the morning of the clinic visit, similar patches had appeared on the left thigh and forearm. The le- sions were associated with burning pain and pruritus, and chills had occurred. The patient had a history of gastroesophageal reflux, anxiety, and depression. Medications included aspirin, furosemide, prednisone, tacrolimus, mycopheno- late mofetil, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, val- ganciclovir, nystatin, omeprazole, cholecalciferol, and magnesium oxide. She was allergic to penicillin, which had caused a rash. She reported no recent insect bites, animal exposures, sick contacts, or use of new skin-care products. She was born in Central America and had immigrated to the United States 31 years earlier. She lived with her husband and four children in an urban area of New England; she no longer worked because of medical disabilities, but she had previously worked at a retail store. She drank wine socially and did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. Her father had died from trauma at 50 years of age, and her mother had died from kidney dis- ease at 75 years of age. There was no family history of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopa- thy, or sudden cardiac death.\nOn examination, the patient appeared  well.\nThe temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 105 beats per minute, and the blood pressure 130/78 mm Hg. There was a healing sternal incision without an exudate, surrounding erythema, or induration. Poorly demarcated, blanching, erythematous nod- ules were present on the lateral left lower leg, medial left thigh, and lateral left arm (Fig. 2); there was no associated necrosis or ulceration. The remainder of the examination was normal.The platelet count, anion gap, prothrombin time, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, and blood levels of electrolytes, total protein, albumin, and globulin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed slightly cloudy, yellow urine, with a specific gravity of 1.029 and a pH of 5.0. Chest radiography revealed stable cardiomegaly and patchy opacification of the left lower lobe, findings consistent with atelectasis. Ultrasonog- raphy revealed persistent thromboses of the gastrocnemius veins and no deep-vein thrombo- sis of the arms. Routine catheterization of the right side of the heart was performed, and fill- ing pressures and cardiac output were normal; a biopsy specimen of the right ventricle was sent for histopathological examination. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nShortly after admission, the patient reported headache and subjective fever. On examination, the temperature was 38.4\u00b0C, and a new erythema- tous lesion had developed on the medial aspect of the right knee. The remainder of the examina- tion was unchanged.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael G. Ison: Although it is possible that this patient\u2019s symptoms have a noninfectious cause, such as deep-vein thrombosis, vasculitis, or drug reaction, infection remains highest on the dif- ferential diagnosis. Since symptoms that were probably related to infection started on day 23 after transplantation, an early nosocomial infec- tion is a strong possibility. The most common early nosocomial infections to occur after trans- plantation are surgical-site infection and Clos- tridium difficile colitis, followed by urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, and pneumo- nia.1 Although this patient\u2019s symptoms could be consistent with cellulitis, the arm and leg in- volvement make this diagnosis unlikely. Bactere- mia and fungemia are the nosocomial infections that are most likely to cause embolic events and lead to the cutaneous manifestations seen in this patient, but most bloodstream infections develop within 21 days after transplantation, so the tim- ing would be somewhat late in this case.1 Given the timing and clinical characteristics of this patient\u2019s presentation, post-transplantation nosocomial infection is an unlikely cause of her current symptoms.\n\n \nDonor-Derived Infection\nDonor-derived infection is defined as any infec- tion present in a transplant recipient that has resulted from an infection present in the donor and transmitted by the donor organ.2 Certain donor-derived infections are very common, and antimicrobial prophylaxis, preemptive treatment, or microbiologic monitoring is typically used to reduce the risk of clinically significant disease in the recipient. Expected transmissions, or infec- tions present in the recipient that had been documented in the donor at the time of dona- tion, may include CMV, EBV, toxoplasmosis, and bacteremia. Most of the focus on donor-derived infection is on unexpected transmissions, or in- fections present in the recipient that had not been suspected in the donor at the time of donation. Estimates from the United States and France suggest that unexpected transmissions are un- common, occurring in less than 0.1% of all trans- plant recipients, and the rate is exceptionally low when the organ is from a living donor. In the United States, among recipients with proven or probable donor-derived infection, the most com- mon classes of transmitted agents are bacteria (23%), viruses (21%), fungi (18%), and parasites (11%).3 It is possible that this patient\u2019s symptoms are caused by a donor-derived infection. The do- nor had a history of drug abuse, which increases the likelihood of occult bacteremia and funge- mia, but the timing of this patient\u2019s presentation is somewhat late for these bloodstream infections. However, donor-derived hepatitis and fungal in- fections, such as cryptococcosis and endemic mycoses, may have longer incubation periods and are therefore still considerations in this case.\n\nRecipient-Origin Infection\nAnother infectious complication is recipient- origin infection, which is defined as any infec- tion incubating or present in a transplant recipi- ent at the time of transplantation. The most common types of recipient-origin infection are bloodstream infection, respiratory viral infection, and latent or chronic infection. This patient\u2019s heart failure, caused by a process resulting in active myocarditis with granulomas and eosino- phils, and the fact that she was from Central America initially suggest the possibility of para- sitic, mycobacterial, or fungal disease of recipi- ent origin. One approach to reduce the frequency of recipient-origin infection is candidate screen- ing. Most centers routinely screen for CMV, EBV, HBV, HCV, HIV, syphilis, toxoplasma, and tuber- culosis.4 Guidelines recommend additional screen- ing on the basis of risk of regionally limited disease. Most patients in the United States who are referred for additional screening are from Central America, the Caribbean, or the Indian subcontinent. The most commonly identified pathogens among Hispanic transplantation can- didates are Mycobacterium tuberculosis (in 20%) and strongyloides (in 7%).5 We are not told about any enhanced screening in this patient, even though testing for strongyloidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and leishmaniasis would typically be considered in transplantation candidates from Central America.\n \nParasitic Causes of Myocarditis\nThis patient is at risk for several parasitic causes of recipient-origin infection, including trypano- soma, toxoplasma, cysticercus, and trichinella, organisms that have all been associated with myocarditis or pancarditis.6 The donor and the patient were both seronegative for toxoplasmosis and the patient was given trimethoprim\u2013sulfa- methoxazole prophylaxis after transplantation; therefore, toxoplasmosis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\nT. cruzi infection causes acute Chagas\u2019 disease, with fever, inflammation, subcutaneous edema, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, myocar- ditis, and in rare cases, meningoencephalitis that typically resolves within 4 to 8 weeks. Chronic Chagas\u2019 disease develops in 30 to 40% of pa- tients with T. cruzi infection and typically has cardiac manifestations (arrhythmias and conduc- tion abnormalities, heart failure, apical aneu- rysms, and sudden death) or gastrointestinal man- ifestations (megaesophagus and megacolon). Patients with cardiac manifestations of chronic Chagas\u2019 disease almost always have evidence of myocarditis and fibrosis on histopathological examination of heart tissue; most have noncaseat- ing granulomas (62%) and giant cells (38%). Intracellular amastigotes are identified in only a minority of patients (15%).7\nTransplant recipients who have Chagas\u2019 dis-\nease due to reactivation of latent T. cruzi infec- tion, which can be either transmitted from the donor or already present in the recipient, classi- cally present with fever, inflammatory pannicu- litis, and skin nodules, findings that are very similar to the presenting features described in this case. Less commonly, these patients have meningoencephalitis or myocarditis that can rapidly progress to allograft rejection and con- gestive heart failure if it is not treated.8,9 In South America, reactivation of latent T. cruzi in- fection occurs in 20 to 90% of transplant recipi- ents who have a known history of Chagas\u2019 dis- ease, with reactivation mostly occurring 11 to 23 weeks after transplantation.8,10 In the largest case series involving transplant recipients with a history of Chagas\u2019 disease in the United States, 19 of the 31 patients (61%) with serologic evi- dence of T. cruzi had reactivation of infection, and 14 of the 31 patients (45%) were from the same country of origin as this patient.8 Most of these patients were monitored prospectively for reactivation, and reactivation was noted an aver- age of 2 weeks after transplantation.\nAmong transplant recipients, risk factors for reactivation of latent T. cruzi infection include rejection of the transplant (hazard ratio for reac- tivation with vs. without risk factor, 1.31); the development of post-transplantation cancer (haz- ard ratio, 5.07), particularly post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder; and the use of my- cophenolate for immunosuppression (hazard ra- tio, 3.14).10 In the United States, it is recommend- ed that patients who have a known history of Chagas\u2019 disease or have received an organ from a donor with Chagas\u2019 disease be monitored by means of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test- ing for the development of parasitemia. Testing begins within 2 weeks after transplantation and is performed weekly for the first 2 months, then every 2 weeks or monthly until month 6; it is typically performed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.8,11\nI suspect that, in this case, Chagas\u2019 myocar-\nditis due to T. cruzi infection that the patient had acquired in Central America caused congestive heart failure that led to transplantation. The findings on histopathological examination of the heart explant are consistent with this diag- nosis. Also, patients with early reactivation of latent T. cruzi infection commonly present with inflammatory panniculitis and skin nodules. To confirm this diagnosis, I would recommend a skin biopsy, which can provide a result quickly, along with PCR testing for the detection of T. cruzi in the blood.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Massoth: On the basis of the pathological findings identified in this case, the differential diagnosis includes Chagas\u2019 disease. Long-stand- ing Chagas\u2019 cardiomyopathy is characterized by cardiomegaly with ventricular dilatation and may include left ventricular apical aneurysm.12 Al- though lymphocytic myocarditis is a classic fea- ture, there is often a mixed, nonneutrophilic inflammatory component with a varying number of eosinophils.7,12 Giant cells and noncaseat- ing granulomas may be present.7 Examination of the myocardium reveals widespread interstitial fibrosis and hypertrophic myocytes.7,12,13 In this case, routine histologic examination did not re- veal tissue amastigotes, which are found only rarely in chronic Chagas\u2019 disease.7,12\nAfter examination of the heart explant, sero- logic studies were performed for the detection of antibodies to T. cruzi. This type of testing is preferred for chronic Chagas\u2019 disease because the disease is often associated with a low para- site burden that may not be detectable by PCR testing or microscopic examination of blood preparations.14 No currently available serologic assay has high enough sensitivity and specificity to be used alone; two positive tests that differ with regard to technique or antigen are required to establish the diagnosis of chronic Chagas\u2019 disease.14,15 In this patient, an enzyme immunoassay and a Western blot assay were concordantly positive, establishing a diagnosis of chronic Chagas\u2019 disease. Shortly after the serologic test results were received, the patient presented with panniculitis, a finding that aroused concern about acute reactivation of latent T. cruzi infection.\nWright\u2013Giemsa staining was performed on a thin smear of the patient\u2019s blood, and light microscopy revealed numerous crescent-shaped trypomastigotes, a finding consistent  with T. cruzi(Fig. 3A). A distinguishing feature of the organ- ism is the prominent kinetoplast at the posterior end, which contains mitochondrial DNA near the base of the flagellum.16,17 In addition, acridine orange staining was performed on a sample of fresh whole blood, and fluorescence microscopy allowed for direct visualization of live parasites (Video 1, available with the full text of this arti- cle at NEJM.org).\nAt the time of this patient\u2019s presentation, a punch biopsy specimen of the leg rash was ob- tained as part of the dermatologic evaluation. Microscopic examination revealed a sparse mixed inflammatory infiltrate that involved the dermis and extended into the subcutaneous tissue in a pattern that was consistent with lobular pannic- ulitis. Parasites were observed in macrophages and also in an extracellular distribution. The vasculature, arrector pili muscles, and subcuta- neous fat were extensively infiltrated by organ- isms (Fig. 3B, 3C, and 3D). Although the amasti- gote form of T. cruzi was predominant, aggregates of parasites that had been released from dying host cells included numerous trypomastigotes (Fig. 3E). After the diagnosis was established, transmission electron microscopy of a formalin- fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen pro- vided a detailed image of the parasites (Fig. 3F, 3G, and 3H).\nFigure 3 (facing page). Blood and Skin Specimens. Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of a thin smear of the patient\u2019s blood (Panel A) shows a trypomastigote, which has a flagellum that is partially attached along the cell body,\nforming an undulating membrane; a relatively central nucleus is present, along with a prominent kinetoplast at the posterior end (arrow). Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a punch biopsy specimen (Panels B and C) shows numerous amastigotes in a perivascular distri\u2011 bution (Panel B, arrow) and infiltrating the arrector pili muscles (Panel C, arrow). Giemsa staining (Panels D and E) shows amastigotes in an enlarged histiocyte, with bar\u2011shaped kinetoplasts (Panel D, arrow), as well as an aggregate of trypomastigotes that were released from a dying host cell in the subcutis, with round, pos\u2011 terior kinetoplasts (Panel E, arrow). Transmission elec\u2011 tron microscopy (Panel F) shows a large histiocyte that contains numerous intracytoplasmic amastigotes. At higher magnification (Panels G and H), the amastigote kinetoplasts (Panel G, arrow) appear to be electron\u2011 dense, and a trypomastigote contains a round kineto\u2011 plast (Panel H, arrow) at the base of the flagellum, which is seen in longitudinal orientation (Panel H, arrowhead).\n\n",
