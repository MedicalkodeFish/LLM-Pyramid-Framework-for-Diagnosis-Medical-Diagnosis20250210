    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Daniele Lerner (Pediatrics): An 18-year-old man with the Dravet syndrome was admitted to this hospital because of fever and increased frequency of seizures.\nThe Dravet syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the sodium channel \u03b11 subunit (SCN1A), had been diagnosed during evaluation for intractable seizures that had begun when the patient was 6 months of age. He had had developmental delay, was nonverbal, and required supervision while walking because of a slow, shuffling gait with associated falls.\nThe patient was in his usual state of health until 2 months before this admis- sion, when his parents noticed swelling of the left foot after a fall. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital, and radiography of the left foot was reportedly normal.\nTwo weeks before this admission, swelling of the left foot increased. The pa- tient was evaluated by his primary care physician, and additional imaging of the foot was recommended. The patient was already scheduled for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head (which was planned to be performed with the patient under general anesthesia) as part of a research study for patients with the Dravet syndrome.1 MRI of the left foot was performed at the same time.\nDr. Teresa Victoria: MRI of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed diffuse cerebral volume loss. There were incidental secretions filling the sphenoid and frontal sinuses that had heteroge- neous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and hyperintense signal intensity on T1-weighted images; mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses was also noted. MRI of the left foot, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed multifocal bone marrow edema in the midfoot and hindfoot. There was no fracture, dislocation, or joint effusion.\nDr. Lerner: Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated by the patient\u2019s primary care physician to treat possible sinusitis. Seven days before this admission, the patient\u2019s parents noticed increased swelling and new warmth of the left foot, and the pa- tient appeared uncomfortable when bearing weight on that foot. The oral tempera-ture measured at home was 38.3\u00b0C. Five days before this admission, bruising of the left foot developed, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient was afebrile and appeared well. There was swelling, bruising, and tenderness of the left foot. The white-cell count was 5870 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the hemoglobin level 11.6 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), and the blood level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 23.9 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Fig. 1) revealed minimally displaced fractures at the base of the second metatarsal and the cuboid, as well as diffuse bone demineralization.\nDr. Lerner: A walking cast was placed, and the patient was discharged home. During the next 5 days, his parents noticed that he was less in- teractive than usual. He had intermittent dia- phoresis and tachycardia, and the frequency of seizures had increased from one every 2 to 3 days to two or three seizures daily. One day before this admission, the oral temperature measured at home was 38.1\u00b0C. After a telephone consulta- tion with the patient\u2019s primary care physician, treatment with amoxicillin was changed to amox-\n \nicillin\u2013clavulanate. The seizure frequency did not decrease, and the patient was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. They had not observed nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or cough. The patient had gingivitis that had recently worsened; dur- ing the 2 weeks before this admission, there had been new bleeding from the gums and bleeding from the nose. The patient was following a ke- togenic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures; because of multiple food allergies, the ketogenic formula was administered through a gastrosto- my tube. He had loose stools, which the parents attributed to tube feeding; the stools were un- changed in volume and frequency. He had had two episodes of nonbilious, nonbloody emesis during the week before this admission.\nThe patient\u2019s parents also reported that  7\nmonths before this admission, the patient had begun to have fever, vomiting, and increased volume and frequency of stools; coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) was diagnosed, and the volume of the ketogenic formula was decreased by half for 4 days until vomiting resolved. Medi- cations included amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate, canna- bidiol, clobazam, famotidine, glycopyrrolate, levocarnitine, levocetirizine, a multivitamin, po- tassium citrate, and phosphorus, as well as loraz-epam as needed for seizures lasting longer than several minutes. He had no known drug aller- gies. He lived with his father and two cats in an urban area of New England; he occasionally stayed with his mother in a rural area of New England. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 124 beats per minute, the blood pressure 124/87 mm Hg, the respira- tory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.8. The patient appeared tired and flushed but was alert and interactive. There was low muscular bulk and tone. The gingivae were erythematous and bleeding (Fig. 2), and several dental caries were seen. There was no sinus tender- ness or discharge. The lungs were clear on aus- cultation, and the heart sounds were normal. The abdomen was nontender, and the insertion site of the gastrostomy tube was not erythema- tous or indurated. The walking cast was removed;there was edema and bruising of the left foot (Fig. 2).\nThe results of tests of liver function and kid- ney function were normal, as were the blood levels of electrolytes and glucose. Urinalysis was normal; there were 2+ ketones (reference value, negative; however, 2+ is considered to be a normal value for patients following a therapeutic ketogenic diet). The blood level of CRP had increased to 74.0 mg per liter; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhi- novirus and enterovirus, Bordetella pertussis, B. para\u00ad pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was negative. Stool testing for Clos\u00ad tridium difficile antigen and toxin was negative, as was a stool examination for ova and parasites. Specimens of blood and stool were sent for cul- ture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Victoria: Radiography of the chest revealed a patchy opacity in the right lung base. Radiog- raphy of the left foot (Fig. 1) revealed diffuse bone demineralization and fractures of the sec- ond metatarsal and cuboid, findings that were similar to those seen on previous imaging. There was sclerosis in the proximal first and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals that was suggestive of new fractures. A crescentic osseous fragment was thought to be an avulsed fragment of bone. Dr. Lerner: A diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was made, treatment with intrave- nous fluids and ampicillin\u2013sulbactam was ad- ministered, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. During the next 7 days, he had no fever, but tachycardia persisted. Blood cultures showed no growth, and stool cultures showed normal intestinal flora. The CRP level had increased to\n108.1 mg per liter, the d-dimer level was 6953\nng per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 500), and the hemoglobin level had decreased to 7.0 g per deciliter. Additional imaging studies were ob- tained. Dr. Victoria: Radiography of the left foot (Fig. 1) revealed multiple new areas of cortical erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal and the medial navicular bone. MRI of the left tibia, fibula, and foot (Fig. 3), per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed worsening bone ede- ma in the left foot; foci of bone edema were also seen in the proximal tibia and fibula. Multiple fractures that had been seen on previous imaging of the left foot were noted, and there were intra- osseous cystic hemorrhagic foci within the cal- caneal, cuboid, and second metatarsal fractures. Dr. Lerner: On hospital day 8, the temporal tem- perature was 38.0\u00b0C. New nontender, purpuric macules were present on the fingers, hands (Fig. 2),\narms, and toes.\nTable 1.

Radiographs of the Left Foot.\nA radiograph obtained 5 days before this admission (Panel A) shows diffuse bone demineralization and lucent lines at the base of the second metatarsal (arrow) and the cuboid (not shown) that were consistent with fractures. A re\u2011 peat radiograph obtained on admission (Panel B) shows new fractures of the proximal first metatarsal (black arrow) and distal fourth and fifth metatarsals (white arrows); a new crescentic osseous fragment (arrowhead) is thought to be an avulsed bone fragment. A radiograph obtained on hospital day 7 (Panel C) shows multiple new areas of corti\u2011 cal erosions, including the medial base of the first metatarsal (black arrow) and the medial navicular bone (white ar\u2011 row); progression of bone edema is also noted.\n\nFigure 2. Clinical Photographs.\nOn admission, the gingivae were erythematous with bleeding (Panel A). After removal of the cast, edema and bruising of the left foot are seen (Panel B). On hospital day 8, nontender, purpuric macules are pres\u2011 ent on the fingers and hands (Panel C), as well as the arms and toes.\n\nFigure 3.

A short\u2011axis fat\u2011saturated T1\u2011weighted image (Pan\u2011 el C) shows an area of T1 shortening in the calcaneus (arrow) that is consistent with hemorrhage; similar findings were present in the cuboid and second metatarsal fractures (not shown).\n\n\n\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "Dravet Syndrome;Bone Marrow Edema;Osteomyelitis;Cancer;Vitamin C Deficiency",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Daniel A. Rauch: This 18-year-old man with the Dravet syndrome began to have low-grade fever and increased frequency of seizures. Two weeks before this admission, treatment with amoxicil- lin had been started because of mucosal thick- ening in the paranasal sinuses and secretions seen on imaging in the absence of clinical symptoms of sinusitis. The patient also had a 2-month history of symptoms involving his left foot, with progressive swelling, pain, and ultimately bruising, and there was MRI evidence of marrow edema in multiple bones of the foot. Subsequent radi- ography revealed diffuse bone demineralization and multiple fractures. Laboratory evaluation in the emergency department revealed anemia, an elevated blood level of CRP, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In working toward the diagnosis in this case, I will first consider how the Dravet syndrome could contrib- ute to this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nDravet Syndrome\nThe Dravet syndrome is a form of epilepsy char- acterized by frequent seizures that may be trig- gered by hyperthermia.2 Patients with the Dravet syndrome can have developmental delay, speech impairment, and hypotonia, all of which were seen in this patient. Patients with the Dravet syndrome can also have ataxia, which could have contrib- uted to this patient\u2019s recent fall. The Dravet syndrome is also associated with dysautonomia, which may help explain this patient\u2019s tachycar- dia and intermittent low-grade fever. However, the Dravet syndrome is not associated with bone disease, nor would it explain this patient\u2019s ele- vated ESR and CRP level. The Dravet syndrome alone would be unlikely to account for all the features of his presentation. I will next consider the patient\u2019s foot swelling and pain, with MRI evidence of marrow edema in multiple bones of the foot.\n\nBone Marrow Edema\nMRI findings consistent with bone marrow edema can be due to a broad array of underlying causes.3 Bone marrow edema in this patient was probably attributed initially to trauma, since it can occur after trauma in patients with or with- out fractures. Given this patient\u2019s young age, a degenerative process such as osteoarthritis would be unlikely, and he did not have risk factors for osteonecrosis resulting from an insufficient vas- cular supply. There was no history of foot sur- gery or radiotherapy to the foot. He did not have other symptoms that would suggest an inflamma- tory arthropathy, such as ankylosing spondylitis.\nPatients with complex regional pain syndrome\ncan have evidence of bone marrow edema on MRI. However, complex regional pain syndrome would be unlikely in this patient, given the ab- sence of examination findings suggestive of this syndrome, such as pain out of proportion to the stimulus, skin changes, or coolness of the foot.4 Bone marrow edema syndrome, a painful self- limited condition of unknown cause, can affect the foot and ankle.5 However, it most commonly affects the hip, occurs in middle-aged men, and is not associated with an elevated ESR or CRP level. In this patient, I will focus on infection and cancer, both of which are associated with bone marrow edema but could also explain the low-grade fever that developed 1 week after the MRI was performed.\n\nOsteomyelitis\nOsteomyelitis involving the bones of the foot could cause swelling, warmth, and pain. Patients with osteomyelitis often have an elevated ESR or CRP level and may have fever. This patient did not have a history of a puncture wound that could have caused direct inoculation of bacteria into a bone in the foot, and there was no overly- ing ulcer or wound on examination. Osteomyeli- tis is most often caused by the hematogenous spread of organisms entering bone from the bloodstream. Could this patient have bacteremia leading to osteomyelitis? He was treated with antibacterial agents for presumed sinusitis. How- ever, the imaging finding of mucosal thickening of the sinuses is not specific for acute sinusitis, which is a clinical diagnosis that is made in pa- tients with nasal discharge or cough.6 This pa- tient did not have symptoms consistent with sinusitis, and bacteremia is not a common complication of sinusitis.\nOn hospital day 8, a diffuse, purpuric rash\ndeveloped, which suggests the possibility of en- docarditis in this patient with fever, an elevated ESR and CRP level, and possible osteomyelitis. He had gingivitis and bleeding gums, which could be a portal of entry of bacteria resulting in bloodstream infection. However, his blood cul- tures showed no growth (although he was being treated with antibiotic therapy). He did not have risk factors for endocarditis, such as congenital heart disease or a central venous catheter, and the cardiac examination was normal. In addition, he had diffuse osteopenia and fractures involving multiple bones of the foot, which would be unex- pected with osteomyelitis.\n\nCancer\nBone pain can be a presenting symptom in pa- tients with leukemia, and fever is common. Al- though this patient had anemia, the white-cell count and platelet count were normal, which de- creases the possibility of an infiltrative process such as leukemia in the bone marrow. A primary bone cancer, such as osteosarcoma or Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, could cause pain and possibly fever, but this patient had no other imaging signs sug- gestive of cancer. In this patient, subsequent imaging revealed bone marrow edema not only in the bones of the left foot but also in the prox- imal tibia and fibula without contiguous tissue involvement, findings that would be unexpected in a primary bone cancer.\nNone of the common causes of bone marrow edema would explain this patient\u2019s constellation of signs and symptoms. Are there other aspects of his presentation that might serve as a pivot point to move closer to the correct diagnosis? Increased frequency of seizures is probably due to fever in this patient with underlying Dravet syndrome, and the change in mental status reported by his parents is most likely a consequence of a sys- temic disease, rather than indicative of a primary central nervous system process.\nThe patient had multiple symptoms related to bleeding, including epistaxis, bleeding from the gums, and bruising over the foot, as well as progressive anemia. Additional imaging of the leg performed during his hospitalization revealed areas of intraosseous hemorrhage within the areas of fracture. The purpuric rash that developed on hospital day 8 could be another manifestation of bleeding. Although the opacity observed on chest radiography was initially attributed to pneu- monia, it could also indicate pulmonary hemor- rhage.\nWhat could confer a predisposition to bleed- ing in this patient? Results of tests of coagula- tion are not provided, but he does not have thrombocytopenia. There is no family history of bleeding, and none of his medications are as- sociated with bleeding. He is following a keto- genic diet as adjunctive treatment for seizures. Although multivitamins are typically prescribed for patients who are following ketogenic diets, it is possible that this type of diet could have led to a vitamin or nutrient deficiency in this patient.7 In addition, the volume of tube feedings was re- duced for a period of time when he had Covid-19 several months before this admission.\nVitamin C Deficiency\nGingivitis is a hallmark finding of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency. Vitamin C is an im- portant coenzyme in collagen production.8 Faulty collagen synthesis leads to the type of gingivitis that is characteristic of vitamin C deficiency, as well as to fragile blood vessels that are prone to hemorrhage9; the presence of fragile blood ves- sels could explain this patient\u2019s multiple sites of bleeding. Vitamin C is also important to the skeletal system, where it serves as an antioxidant and promotes bone matrix gene expression in osteoblasts; thus, a deficiency is associated with osteoporosis and an increased risk of fracture.10 Recently, vitamin C deficiency has been associated with evidence of bone marrow edema on MRI.11 Vitamin C deficiency could also explain this patient\u2019s low-grade fever and changes in be- havior and mood.12 Vitamin C deficiency is the best explanation for this patient\u2019s constellation of symptoms, and I suspect that the diagnostic test was measurement of the vitamin C level.\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Vitamin deficiency most consistent with vitamin C deficiency",
    "Diagnosis": "Multiple vitamin deficiencies, including vitamin C deficiency",
    "Key testing": "The blood level of vitamin C",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Lerner: The blood level of vitamin C was less than 0.1 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.4 to 2.0). Results of iron studies were consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. The blood level of vita- min B1 (thiamine) was 68 nmol per liter (reference range, 70 to 180), the vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) level 2 \u03bcg per liter (reference range, 5 to 50), and the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level 23 ng per milliliter (57 nmol per liter; reference range, 20 to 80 ng per milliliter [50 to 200 nmol per li- ter]). The blood levels of vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B12  (cobalamin), and vitamin K were normal.\nBecause of fever and the elevated blood level of d-dimer, the patient was evaluated for venous thromboembolism by means of ultrasonography of the left leg and computed tomography with angiography of the chest; both were normal. Multiple sets of blood cultures were negative, and transthoracic echocardiography was normal, with no evidence of valvular vegetations.\nAdditional information was obtained from the primary care clinic at the other hospital. The patient\u2019s parents had frequently made changes to the patient\u2019s ketogenic diet without consult- ing the primary care clinic, and there were peri- ods during which the patient may not have re- ceived vitamins at the recommended doses. After the diagnosis of vitamin C deficiency was made, the patient\u2019s parents reported that he had been receiving reduced tube feedings for more than 1 month before the current admission because they thought it helped reduce vomiting and diar- rhea. Review of records from the other hospital revealed a weight decrease of 4.7 kg during the 6 weeks before this admission.\n",
