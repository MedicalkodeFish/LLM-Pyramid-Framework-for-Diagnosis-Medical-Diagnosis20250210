    "Primary Symptom": "A 68-Year-Old Woman  with Abnormal Movements and Confusion",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. D. Curtis Wegener (Neurology): A 68-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion and abnormal movements of the face, arms, and legs. The patient had been in her usual state of health until 9 weeks before the cur- rent presentation, when she presented to another hospital because of intermittent slurred speech and dizziness that had lasted for 1 day. The score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was obtained; the NIHSS is an 11-com- ponent tool that assesses the severity of stroke, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits. Her NIHSS score was 1 owing to the presence of mild-to-moderate dysarthria, and she was not consid- ered to be a candidate for treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.\nImaging studies were obtained.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed a punctate focus of restricted diffusion associated with mild signal hyperintensity involving the deep white matter of the left frontal lobe on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. This finding was consistent with an acute ischemic infarct without hemorrhage or mass effect. There were also findings that had been observed on previous imaging, including foci of encephalomalacia in the right inferior frontal lobe and left occipital lobe that were related to previous trauma, a punctate old lacunar infarct in the inferior left cerebellar hemisphere, and super- imposed patchy foci of T2-weighted and FLAIR white-matter hyperintensity most consistent with small-vessel disease. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck reportedly showed no intracranial or cervical occlusion, high-grade ste- nosis, or aneurysm. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nThe patient had been taking apixaban daily because of a history of two deep venous thromboses, and the treatment was continued. She had also been taking atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and the dose was increased. Transthoracic echo- cardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no patent foramen ovale. Continuous telemetric monitor- ing showed no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Mobile cardiac telemetry was planned for the 30-day period after discharge.\nOn the second hospital day, frequent irregu- lar movements of the right leg developed, occur- ring every few seconds in a nonrhythmic pat- tern. The next day, similar movements of the right arm developed. The patient described the movements as involuntary and reported no uncon- trollable urges or compulsions to move the arm or leg. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, was reportedly nega- tive for any new findings. Electroencephalogra- phy (EEG) was reportedly normal in the waking, drowsy, and light-sleep states. The dysarthria re- solved, but the involuntary movements persisted. The patient was discharged home on the seventh hospital day.\nDuring the next 6 weeks, involuntary move- ments involving the arms, legs, and tongue oc- curred with increasing frequency. The patient began using a walker. Nine days before the cur- rent presentation, the patient was again admit- ted to the other hospital after multiple falls at home, which she attributed to uncontrolled movements of her arms and legs. On examina- tion, she had nearly constant writhing, non- rhythmic, dancelike movements of the arms, legs, and trunk, as well as rolling movements of the tongue. She could stand up from a chair while holding onto a walker. Scattered bruises were present on the lower legs. Imaging studies were obtained.\nCT of the head, performed without the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly showed mild scattered parenchymal hypodensities without hemorrhage or evidence of an acute infarct. A presumptive diagnosis of vascular chorea was made, and the patient was treated with oral levetiracetam. On the third hospital day, MRI of the head was attempted but was limited by motion artifacts due to involun- tary movements. There were small foci of re- stricted diffusion in the right frontal and pari- etal periventricular white matter within the right corona radiata and centrum semiovale, findings consistent with new small acute-to-subacute in- farcts without hemorrhage or mass effect.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the dose of levetiracetam was increased. EEG reportedly showed excessive irregular background slow-wave activ- ity without focal, lateralizing, or epileptiform features; there were no findings that correlated to the movements of the head and body. On the fifth hospital day, the irregular movements had not abated, and treatment with  levetiracetam was stopped. Treatment with low-dose clonaze- pam at bedtime was started to help with sleep. On the sixth hospital day, the patient was dis- charged to a rehabilitation facility.\nThree days after discharge, a family member observed that the patient was confused and un- able to maintain a conversation. The family member brought her to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital for evaluation. In the emer- gency department, the patient was not able to provide additional information. Other medical history, obtained from the family member, in- cluded hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary hyperten- sion, and vitiligo.\nMedications included ambrisentan, apixaban, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, glipizide, levothy- roxine, metformin, omeprazole, and sitagliptin. Clonazepam had not been administered at the rehabilitation facility. The patient had taken warfarin for many years for her history of two deep venous thromboses; 10 months before the current presentation, treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban. Acetylsalicylic acid had caused hives; there were no other known allergies. Before being discharged to the reha- bilitation facility, the patient had lived alone in a suburban area and had worked in a school. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and drank alcohol rarely. Her father and brother had diabetes mel- litus; there was no family history of abnormal movements or stroke.\nThe  temperature was 36.6\u00b0C,  the blood pres-\nsure 125/60 mm Hg, the pulse 79 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 23.6. The patient was sleepy but arousable with verbal stimuli. She was oriented to self but not to time or place. She could follow simple commands with repeated instructions but could not follow complex commands. She had irregular spontaneous movements of the face, mouth, and tongue; she also had irregular spontaneous writhing movements of the arms and legs that were par- tially suppressible. When she was asked to hold her arms outstretched with the palms facing upward while keeping her eyes closed, her right arm drifted downward, and the palm pronated toward the f loor. Strength was 4 out of 5 on right shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist flexion, and wrist extension; the remainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes, alanine amino- transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alka- line phosphatase were normal, as were the re- sults of kidney-function tests. Urinalysis showed trace ketones and 1+ leukocyte esterase (refer- ence value, negative); the urine sediment showed 0 to 2 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm per hour (reference range for women in the patient\u2019s age group, 0 to 40). Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Hillary R. Kelly: CT of the head performed\nwithout the administration of intravenous con- trast material, as well as CT angiography of the head and neck performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed no evidence of an acute territorial infarct and no change in the long-term findings, including the previously described areas of encephalomalacia and periventricular white-matter hypodensity.\nMRI of the head (Fig. 1), performed with and without the administration of intravenous con- trast material, showed multiple foci of restricted diffusion associated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperintensity,  findings  consistent  with  acute-to-early subacute infarcts. Foci were scattered throughout the cortex and subcortical white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. The most prominent foci were located along the left tem- poro-occipital junction. Numerous foci involved the cortex of the frontal and parietal lobes along the precentral and postcentral gyri. There was a small punctate focus of restricted diffusion as- sociated with T2-weighted and FLAIR hyperin- tensity in the right superior cerebellar hemi- sphere, a finding consistent with an additional small infarct. There was no associated hemor- rhage or mass effect. Magnetic resonance angi- ography of the head, performed without the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material,showed no intracranial occlusion, high-grade stenosis, or aneurysm.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: This 68-year-old woman pre- sented with subacute progressive abnormal move- ments and confusion. To construct a differential diagnosis, I will begin by characterizing the phenomenology and attempting neurologic local- ization.\nThe patient had abnormal movements that were widely distributed, involving the face, mouth, tongue, arms, and legs on both sides of her body. The movements were initially intermit- tent but progressively worsened. She had no premonition and considered the movements to be involuntary. The movements affected her abil- ity to function and were associated with falls despite the use of a walker. Additional neurologic findings included dysarthria, confusion, impaired arousal, and arm weakness. The de- scription of this patient\u2019s movements is most consistent with chorea, which is characterized  by involuntary, nonrhythmic movements due to continuous flow of muscle contractions from one muscle group to another, creating a dance- like appearance.\nChorea usually localizes to extrapyramidal basal ganglia networks.1 Basal ganglionic dis- eases can be diffuse or discrete. When they are discrete, they usually also affect adjacent struc- tures, such as the internal capsule, hypothala- mus, or cerebral white matter. This patient\u2019s other neurologic deficits (dysarthria, confusion, and sleepiness) are nonlocalizing, given  that  they can all be caused by diffuse or multifocal cerebral processes or toxic\u2013metabolic abnor- malities. Her weakness is not described as being in any particular diagnostic pattern. A pronator drift is mentioned, but I interpret this finding with caution because movements resembling pronation can be seen in patients with chorea.\nVarious neurologic and systemic disorders have been associated with chorea. The differen- tial diagnosis can be narrowed by considering the bilateral nature of the abnormal movements, the time course of the illness, the patient\u2019s medical history and medications, and the find- ings on laboratory testing and MRI of the head performed at the time of admission.\nVascular Lesions\nVascular chorea was considered by the treating physicians during the patient\u2019s second hospital admission. Large unilateral lesions of the antero- ventral caudate, striatum, or thalamus can cause contralateral chorea or athetosis.1 However, the infarcts observed on MRI of the head in this pa- tient were small and not specifically located in basal ganglia structures. Small focal lesions rare- ly cause clinically significant movement disorders, except in the case of unilateral hemiballismus, which is caused by damage to the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. If this patient\u2019s bilateral chorea was a result of vascular lesions, substan- tial bilateral infarction of the caudate or similar structures would probably be present. Overall, I think vascular chorea is unlikely in this patient.\nGenetic Disorders\nThe patient\u2019s presentation in the seventh decade of life with a subacute course, over a period of months, makes a genetic cause of chorea un- likely in this case. Most genetic causes of chorea would have an earlier onset or a gradually pro- gressive course, typically over a period of years. Many are autosomal recessive or X-linked disor- ders of childhood. This patient had no clinical features supportive of Huntington\u2019s disease, such as difficulty with initiating eye movements or a neuropsychiatric prodrome. In addition, she had no other features suggestive of mitochondrial disease, such as hearing loss or short stature.\nAmong genetic disorders, acute intermittent porphyria and other acute hepatic porphyrias could be considered because they can cause cen- tral nervous system disturbances that rarely in- clude movement disorders. However, porphyria commonly also causes peripheral neuropathy, which appears to be absent in this patient. It is important to note that a neurologic presentation without abdominal pain would be uncommon.\n\nToxic and Metabolic Disorders\nThe patient was not taking any medications as- sociated with chorea, such as neuroleptic agents, anticonvulsant agents, amphetamines, or anti- parkinsonian medications. There was no history of an anoxic insult, carbon monoxide poisoning, or an occupational exposure (e.g., exposure to heavy metals). Hyperglycemia can cause chorea, as can hypernatremia and hyponatremia, but these findings were not present in this patient. Hyperthyroidism can cause movement disorders, most commonly an enhanced physiologic tremor but rarely also chorea.2,3 However, this patient\u2019s blood thyrotropin level was only mildly elevated, and the blood free thyroxine level was normal.\nHepatocerebral degeneration can occur in patients with any acquired liver disease or with portosystemic shunts, and it can result in pro- gressive tremor and other movement disorders, such a myoclonus, dystonia, or chorea.4 MRI of the head may show signal hyperintensity in the basal ganglia on T1-weighted imaging, which is due to manganese deposition. This patient had normal results of liver-function tests, had no examination findings compatible with liver dis- ease, and had no imaging findings suggestive of hepatocerebral degeneration.\n\nInfections\nInfection with group A beta-hemolytic strepto- coccus (acute rheumatic fever) can cause Syden- ham chorea, but this type of chorea is primarily a childhood disease with a decreasing incidence in the United States. In addition, there is no re- port of pharyngitis or other features of acute rheumatic fever in this patient. She is at low epidemiologic risk for human immunodefi- ciency virus encephalitis and tuberculosis, two other infections associated with chorea. Sporadic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, which is the most common human prion disease, has a heteroge- neous spectrum of clinical manifestations that can include dementia, behavioral changes, vision deficits, ataxia, and movement disorders.5 MRI  of the head typically shows restricted diffusion in neocortical or subcortical regions,6 which was not present in this patient.\n\nInflammatory Disorders\nInflammatory disorders that can cause chorea include multiple sclerosis, neurosarcoidosis, and neuro-Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease. These disorders can be ruled out because the characteristic imaging findings were not present on MRI of the head.\n\nParaneoplastic Disorders\nParaneoplastic chorea is most likely to occur in older men with coexisting peripheral neuropa-\n \nthy. Small-cell carcinoma of the lung is the most common associated cancer. Paraneoplastic cho- rea may be associated with positivity for neural antibodies,7 which is best detected with antibody panel testing. However, some of these antibod- ies may also be present in patients with non- paraneoplastic autoimmune chorea.\n\nAutoimmune Disorders\nAfter levodopa-induced dyskinesias and Hun- tington\u2019s chorea, autoimmune chorea is the most common type of chorea in adults. It may be as- sociated with systemic autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).\nChorea is the most common movement disor- der among patients with SLE, occurring in 2% of patients.8 When chorea occurs in patients with SLE, it is bilateral in 55% of cases and is limited to a single episode in 66% of cases, although multiple episodes are possible. Other neuropsy- chiatric symptoms of SLE can include seizures, delirium, brain ischemia, and psychiatric distur- bances, ranging from personality changes to psychosis. This patient had no musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous, serosal, or renal features of SLE, but she did have anemia and leukopenia.9\nAPS can occur as a primary disorder or can be secondary to connective-tissue disorders, in- cluding SLE. It is characterized by vascular thrombosis (venous, arterial, or small-vessel thrombosis) and complications during preg- nancy. A wide variety of neurologic manifesta- tions have been reported with APS, such as ischemic stroke, migraine, myelopathy, epilepsy, and dementia. Chorea is the most common movement disorder among patients with APS, occurring in 1.3% of patients.10 The pathogene- sis may extend beyond ischemia, given that antiphospholipid antibodies have been shown to bind to neuronal structures and possibly change behavior in mice.8,10\nMultifocal Strokes\nIs there a unifying diagnosis in this case that explains the chorea and the presence of multifo- cal small infarcts despite anticoagulation with apixaban? The differential diagnosis for strokes despite anticoagulation includes reduced efficacy of the anticoagulant in the individual patient, poor adherence to the anticoagulant regimen, and the presence of stroke mechanisms that are less amenable to anticoagulation, such as hyper- tensive or diabetic small-vessel occlusion, vascu- litis, or infective endocarditis. When a patient has APS or a cancer-associated hypercoagulable state, different anticoagulants may have differ- ent effects. Indeed, this patient\u2019s treatment had been switched from warfarin to apixaban 10 months before the current presentation, and apixaban may be a less effective anticoagulant in patients with APS. The presence of arterial strokes despite anticoagulation, along with the history of venous thromboembolism, is very sug- gestive of a diagnosis of APS possibly due to underlying SLE. To establish this diagnosis, I would perform testing for lupus anticoagulant and for anticardiolipin and anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibodies, as well as antinuclear antibody test- ing to determine whether the patient has SLE.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Mandakolathur R. Murali: The prolonged acti- vated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT) and international normalized ratio in this patient could be attributed to the use of apixaban. How- ever, the prolonged aPTT could also be due to a coagulation factor deficiency or the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. A 1:1 mixing study (in which a plasma specimen from the patient was mixed with normal plasma in equal proportions) revealed no deficiency of clotting factors and no inhibitors of intrinsic or contact factors that af- fect the aPTT. Therefore, lupus anticoagulant testing was performed. The lupus anticoagulant\u2013 sensitive aPTT test was positive, and therefore, the three confirmative tests for antiphospholipid antibodies were performed. The hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization test was posi- tive, confirming the presence of a lupus antico- agulant. The test for anticardiolipin IgG and IgM was strongly positive (114.7 units and 26.0 units, respectively; reference range, 0.0 to 15.0). The test for anti\u2013\u03b22-glycoprotein I antibodies was negative. Therefore, two of the three criteria for confirming the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies were met. The anticardiolipin IgG and IgM persisted after 12 weeks, meeting the criteria for APS.11\nThe presence of antinuclear antibodies at a titer of 1:160 in a homogeneous and speckled pattern (dual pattern) on an indirect immuno- fluorescence assay with human epithelial cells,  as well as the presence of anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies at a high titer (1:320) on a Cri- thidia luciliae immunofluorescence assay, estab- lished the serologic diagnosis of SLE in this patient.12 The low C3 level (56 mg per deciliter; reference range, 81 to 157) and low C4 level (6 mg per deciliter; reference range, 12 to 39) sug- gested that classical pathway activation by im- mune complexes had led to inflammation and tissue injury of multiple organs. These immune complexes activate platelets, endothelial cells, and the coagulation cascade.\n",
