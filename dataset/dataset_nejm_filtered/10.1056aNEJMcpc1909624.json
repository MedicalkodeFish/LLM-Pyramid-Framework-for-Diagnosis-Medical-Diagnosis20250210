    "Primary Symptom": "A 70-Year-Old Woman with Rapidly Progressive Ataxia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kun-Wei Song (Neurology): A 70-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive ataxia.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of good health until 3 months before this admission, when fatigue and general unsteadiness developed. Two months before admission, episodes of worsening unsteadiness occurred. The patient was no longer able to walk in a straight line or to remain stable in yoga poses that had previously been easy for her. No associated falls, vertigo, loss of consciousness, ear pain, hearing loss, tinnitus, or headache were reported. She was evaluated by her primary care physician, who was affiliated with another hospital, and a neuro- logic examination was reportedly normal. The white-cell count, hematocrit, hemo- globin level, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and thyrotropin were nor- mal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; a test for Lyme disease was negative. The patient was referred to an otolaryngologist.\nSeven weeks before admission, the patient was evaluated by an otolaryngologist at the other hospital. The examination revealed auditory canals and tympanic membranes that were normal in appearance; an audiogram showed normal hear- ing. The patient was told that her symptoms were not caused by a vestibular pro- cess, and she was referred to a neurologist.\nFour weeks before admission, progressive gait imbalance developed. The patient was able to walk in her home without falling by leaning on walls and surfaces for support, but she needed a cane or the assistance of her husband to walk outside. She was evaluated in a neurology clinic at the other hospital. She reported a sensa- tion of impaired balance that persisted when she was seated in a chair and dimin- ished, but did not resolve, when she was in the supine position. She also noted a loss of coordination in her hands; her handwriting had progressively become larger, and she had difficulty eating soup. She reported new blurry vision, insomnia, and a constant mild headache.\nOn examination, the patient was awake, alert, and oriented. Her speech was fluent and clear. A slightly wide-based, unsteady gait was noted, with jerking movements of the trunk, hips, and legs. She was unable to walk with a tandem gait or on her toes or heels. The Rom- berg sign was present, and a subtle postural tremor in both hands was noted. The remainder of her neurologic examination was normal. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:40 with a speckled pattern. Blood levels of fo- late, thiamine, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12), vi- tamin E, vitamin B6, and C-reactive protein were normal, as was the erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate. Results of serum protein electrophore- sis were also normal. A screening test for syphi- lis was negative.\nDr. Bradley R. Buchbinder: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed be- fore and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed min- imal, confluent periventricular signal hyperinten- sity and scattered focal subcortical signal hyper- intensity in both cerebral hemispheres, with mild ventricular prominence (Fig. 1).\nDr. Song: The patient was advised to undergo physical therapy for balance training. Two weeks before admission, sudden and involuntary move- ments of the arms developed that were associated with loss of positional awareness. The patient sought a second opinion from an otolaryngolo- gist at this hospital, who referred her to the emergency department; she was admitted to the neurology service for further evaluation. She re- ported ongoing involuntary movements of the arms and loss of positional awareness. Her hus- band reported that she would often place her coffee cup on a table with excessive force or drop it several inches above the surface. She now required a walker and had had two falls resulting from loss of balance. She also noted new hori- zontal double vision, decreased appetite, weight loss of approximately 2 to 3 kg in the past month, and a cough.\nThe patient was right-handed. She had a history of hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and asthma and a long history of mild hearing loss. Medications included simvastatin, vaginal estrogen, and, as needed, lorazepam for insom- nia. She had no known medication allergies.\nThe patient was a retired educator and lived with her husband in New England. She had traveled extensively in the eastern United States and in Western Europe. She had previously par- ticipated in daily aerobics, yoga, and dance classes. She had consumed one glass of wine nightly but stopped when her symptoms began. She did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. Her mother had hypertension, and her father had died from lung cancer; her brother and two adult children were healthy. There was no family history of ataxia, dementia, autoimmune disease, or neurodegenerative disease.\nOn examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and interactive. The temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the pulse 71 beats per minute, the blood pressure 143/94 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The neck was supple, and she did not have thyromegaly or thyroid nodules. The speech was fluent, with no dysarthria. She had marked dysmetria bilaterally on finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing; severe dysdiadochokinesia (i.e., an impaired ability to perform rapid alternating movements) was also noted. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with truncal ataxia. The remainder of the exami- nation was normal, including repetition and nam- ing, strength, deep-tendon and plantar reflexes, and sensory function. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium were normal, as were the results of kidney- function testing and urine toxicologic screening. A lumbar puncture was performed, and tests for paraneoplastic antibodies in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were negative. Other laboratory test results and the results of the CSF analysis are shown in Table 1. An MRI of the head was obtained and was interpreted as unchanged from the study obtained 1 month earlier.\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a single sharp wave in the left parietal region but was otherwise normal. Combined positron- emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) from the skull base to midthigh, per- formed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed no abnormal FDG uptake. A working diagnosis of autoimmune cerebellitis was made, and intravenous immune globulin was administered. The patient was discharged home on the sixth hospi- tal day, with a plan to follow up in the ataxia unit of this hospital.\nThree weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the ataxia unit. Her gait and coor- dination had worsened; she could no longer am- bulate independently with a walker and required one-person assistance. New dysarthria had de- veloped, along with short-term memory loss; she began to forget conversations held earlier in the day. Oculomotor examination revealed occasional square-wave jerks in the primary position (i.e., inappropriate saccades that take the eyes off the target when a person is looking forward, followed by a corrective saccade that brings the eyes back to the target), slowed pursuit movements with frequent saccadic intrusions, hypermetric and hypometric saccades, and mild gaze-evoked nystagmus in the horizontal plane. Her dysar- thria was mild but became worse when she at- tempted to recite consonants rapidly. On finger- to-nose testing, there was bilateral end-point dysmetria with oscillating movements at the el- bows, overshoot during rapid finger movements, and dysdiadochokinesia. On heel-to-shin testing, the patient had jerking movements of the shins in the axis, with occasional superimposed lateral movements that occurred more frequently on the left side than on the right side. Rapid tapping of the heels on the ground was dysrhythmic. The gait was profoundly impaired; it was wide-based and unstable, and there was marked titubation of the trunk. The patient required maximal one- person assistance. She was unable to spontane- ously recall a list of five words learned a few minutes earlier, and her recall did not improve even after she was provided a category clue or a list of multiple-choice answers. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 15 on a scale of 0 to 30, with a score of less than 25 indicating cognitive impairment and lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.\n\nTable 1.

Diffusion\u2011weighted images also show subtle hyperintensity in the anterior cingulate gyri (Panel F, arrow\u2011 heads) that is more prominent on the left than the right, but the cerebral cortex is otherwise spared. No definite abnormality is identified in the cerebellum.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Bart K. Chwalisz: This 70-year-old woman pre- sented with rapidly progressive ataxia \u2014 an impairment in the rate, range, and rhythm of voluntary movement that is unexplained by weak- ness. This condition can result from cerebellar and extracerebellar disease. My first step in con- structing a differential diagnosis is to localize the lesion in the nervous system.\n\nLocalization\nDysfunction of the somatosensory and vestibu- lar inputs into the cerebellum can cause ataxia, and sensory ataxia typically worsens with re- moval of visual fixation. This phenomenon is the basis for the Romberg sign, which is charac- terized by the presence of impaired balance while a person stands on a narrow base with closed eyes, a finding that this patient was noted to have. However, sensory ataxia is generally accom- panied by impairment in proprioception or by diminished reflexes, neither of which this pa- tient had. Similarly, no clinical findings of ves- tibular disease were elicited. Therefore, I think that this patient\u2019s ataxia originated from a dis- ease of the cerebellum itself. I would ask whether this patient had impaired balance while stand- ing on a narrow base with her eyes open, a find- ing that would be consistent with disease of the cerebellum.\nAnother important function of the cerebellum\nis oculovestibular coordination. This patient had saccadic dysmetria and impaired smooth pur- suit, which localize to the dorsal vermis and the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum.1 Square- wave jerks, which were noted in this patient, are typically asymptomatic and are distinct from other eye-movement disorders, such as nystagmus, opsoclonus, and ocular flutter. Square-wave jerks can occur in patients with disorders of the cere- bellar and extracerebellar central nervous system. The cerebellum also has cognitive and affec- tive function, which localizes to the posterior lobe. Deficits resulting from damage to the cognitive cerebellum have been characterized as the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome,2 which can be considered a \u201cdysmetria of thought.\u201d3 This syndrome is characterized by deficits in executive function, linguistic fluency, and visuo- spatial performance, as well as by neuropsychiat- ric symptoms. However, focal cortical cognitive deficits should be considered red flags indicative of extracerebellar disease.4 A true amnestic defi- cit, which was seen in this patient, is not part of the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome. In fact, most patients with disease that is limited to the cerebellum have scores in the normal range on bedside cognitive screening tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment,4 whereas this patient had a score that indicated dementia. In addition, cerebellar disease does not lead to spon- taneous abnormal movements. This patient be- gan to have uncontrollable arm jerks that were consistent with myoclonus \u2014 another sign that extracerebellar structures were becoming involved as her disease progressed. Lastly, the EEG showed a single spike, indicating cortical irritability, which also points to extracerebellar involvement. The differential diagnosis in this patient is focused on a subacute progressive disease that starts in the cerebellum and spreads to other parts of the central nervous system. This \u201cataxia plus\u201d syndrome could be the result of a toxic or metabolic disorder, infection, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, an immune-mediated condition,\nor neurodegeneration.\n\nToxic and Metabolic Disorders\nSubstances of abuse, such as alcohol, can cause ataxia, as can a number of medications, including antiepileptic agents and sedatives.5,6 However, the patient was not taking any of these drugs, and her history of alcohol use was modest. I would ask specifically about the use of bismuth subsalicylate, a widely available over-the-counter medication for gastrointestinal ailments. Over- use of bismuth can cause subacute changes in mental state and amnesia \u2014 symptoms that are sometimes misdiagnosed as Alzheimer\u2019s disease or Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. Myoclonus and ataxia can be prominent, and EEG may reveal epileptiform abnormalities. However, given that the patient had no known history of exposure to bismuth, I will consider alternative diagnoses.\nEnvironmental exposure to heavy metals, particularly mercury, can cause an ataxic syndrome.7 The toxic effects of manganese can also include movement disorders.5 Although no manganese level was reported for this patient, she was appro- priately screened for exposure to other heavy metals, and all such screening tests were negative. Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy can cause acute ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion in pa- tients who are nutritionally deficient in thiamine. Despite this patient\u2019s normal results on MRI of the head, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy cannot be\n \nruled out on the basis of these findings, given that MRI findings are specific, but not sensitive, for this disease.8 However, this patient did not have a history of alcohol use disorder, bariatric surgery, or prolonged vomiting \u2014 characteris- tics that would have suggested an increased risk for a nutritional deficiency. Therefore, a diagno- sis of Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is unlikely.\n\nInfection\nCerebellitis can occur as either a direct infection or a parainfectious phenomenon.9,10 Both variants are more common in children than in adults. Varicella\u2013zoster infection is the most common cause of cerebellitis in adults, but I would expect a more acute presentation and evidence of in- flammation in the CSF. Listeria rhombencepha- litis can be acute or subacute, and it occurs pri- marily in older adults, especially among those who are immunosuppressed.11 Neurologic Whip- ple\u2019s disease is characterized by subacute demen- tia, ataxia, and myoclonus.12,13 In both listeria rhombencephalitis and neurologic Whipple\u2019s dis- ease, MRI of the head may occasionally be nor- mal, but the absence of evidence of inflamma- tion in this patient\u2019s CSF makes these diagnoses unlikely.\nJC virus has a predilection for white matter of the cerebellum and its peduncles.14,15 However, JC virus infection is a disease that occurs in im- munosuppressed patients and causes character- istic brain lesions that can be seen on MRI; therefore, JC virus infection is an unlikely diag- nosis in this case.\n\nLeptomeningeal Carcinomatosis\nPatients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis can have a subacute syndrome that includes ataxia. MRI may or may not show signal hyperintensity in the cerebellar sulci on T2-weighted FLAIR im- ages or enhancement in the cerebellar sulci on gadolinium-enhanced images.16 Given that this patient had a normal CSF protein level and cell count, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is very unlikely.17\n\nImmune-Mediated Conditions\nParaneoplastic cerebellar degeneration is defined as ataxia that develops within 5 years before or after a diagnosis of cancer, and ataxia predates the cancer diagnosis in 65% of cases. This patient\u2019s tests for paraneoplastic antibodies in the blood and CSF were negative, but 18% of affected patients are seronegative. However, PET-CT from the skull base to the thighs was unremarkable in this patient. Therefore, a diagnosis of para- neoplastic cerebellar degeneration is unlikely.\nAutoimmune cerebellar ataxia is a syndrome that is similar to paraneoplastic cerebellar de- generation, but affected patients have no evi- dence of cancer.18 A disease characterized by an association of cerebellar ataxia with antibodies related to celiac disease has been described, but the disease course is typically slower than that seen in this patient. A cerebellar variant of Hashimoto\u2019s encephalopathy that is associated with antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyro- globulin, which were seen in this patient, has been described. However, approximately 15% of the population has seropositivity for thyroid per- oxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, making attribution of neurologic symptoms to the pres- ence of these antibodies tenuous at best. In ad- dition, the disease course is usually slower than that seen in this patient, and the CSF findings are typically abnormal. Therefore, Hashimoto\u2019s encephalopathy is unlikely. Nevertheless, immu- nosuppressive therapy was administered when the diagnosis of autoimmune cerebellitis was considered.19 The patient\u2019s neurologic disease progressed despite this treatment.\nNeurodegeneration\nSporadic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease is the most common human prion disease and has a broad and heterogeneous spectrum of manifestations. The cerebellar form of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob dis- ease (Brownell\u2013Oppenheimer variant) is char- acterized by a cerebellar syndrome with no evidence of cognitive impairment in the first month of illness, and it accounts for approxi- mately 20% of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease.20,21 The mean age at onset is 63 years, and the first symptoms that occur are most commonly gait dysfunction, dizziness, and incoordination, all of which are consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation. Cognitive impairment occurs a mean of 3 months after the on- set of ataxic symptoms \u2014 a clinical course that closely matches this patient\u2019s course. Other neurologic features, such as pyramidal signs, myoclonus, or vision impairment, become evident with progression; these findings were also observed in this patient.\nDoes the absence of abnormal findings on MRI or EEG make Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease un- likely? Abnormal MRI findings usually occur at some point in the disease course, but they may initially be subtle or misread.22,23 EEG has low sensitivity for the cerebellar form of Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease. I think this patient\u2019s presentation is most consistent with the cerebellar form of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. To establish this diag- nosis, I would obtain CSF to perform tests for markers of neuronal damage, such as 14-3-3 pro- tein and total tau, as well as a real-time quaking- induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay.\nDr. Meridale V. Baggett (Medicine): Dr. Schmah-\nmann, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this patient?\nDr. Jeremy D. Schmahmann: This patient had cer- ebellar ataxia that had developed over a period of days to a few weeks, with a limited differential diagnosis of potentially life-threatening condi- tions. On presentation to this hospital, the pa- tient\u2019s care was managed with the same degree of urgency as would be the care of a patient with acute change in mental status, with a focus on identifying reversible conditions. She was treated with high-dose thiamine but had no response. Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease was considered during her initial admission to this hospital, since the classic EEG and MRI findings can be delayed in onset. However, because immune-mediated ataxias can mimic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, the patient received immunosuppressive therapy, despite a neg- ative evaluation for cancer and paraneoplastic antibodies. We took the approach of treating the potentially curable conditions while waiting for the results of the Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease tests. The patient had no response to immunosup- pressive therapy. As the disease progressed, her cognitive issues evolved into an amnestic demen- tia, making Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease the most\nlikely diagnosis from a clinical perspective.\n\n\n\n",
