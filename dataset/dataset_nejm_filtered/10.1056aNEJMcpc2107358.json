    "Primary Symptom": "A 9-Year-Old Boy with Transient Weakness, Facial Droop, and Slurred Speech",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Sagar M. Raju (Pediatrics): A 9-year-old boy was transferred to this hospital be- cause of transient weakness and facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. The patient had been well until 5 hours before this evaluation, when his parents observed that he had a facial droop on the left side and slurred speech. In addition, the patient noticed that his left arm and leg felt \u201climp.\u201d When he moved to get out of his bed, he could not stand on his own or grip using the left hand. There was no confusion, loss of consciousness, shaking in the arms or legs, urinary or fecal incontinence, headache, nausea, vomiting, recent illness, or trauma. The symp- toms lasted approximately 2 minutes and then resolved completely. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was taken to the emergency depart-\nment of another hospital.\nAt the other hospital, the physical examination was reportedly normal. The complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, prothrombin time, partial- thromboplastin time, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and troponin were normal, as were the results of tests of renal, liver, and thyroid function. The pa- tient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, additional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. Earlier in the day, the patient had become upset while visiting his grand- father, who was dying of esophageal cancer. He then played a game of hockey with a sibling; no falls or head trauma occurred. At the time that his parents observed the new neurologic symptoms, he had been lying in bed and crying profusely and inconsolably for an extended period. His parents noticed that he was gasping for air and hiccupping while crying.\nThe patient had been born by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery at full term. He had met normal developmental milestones and had received routine childhood vaccinations. He had chronic gastrointestinal upset that had been attributed to anxiety. Two years earlier, he had been evaluated at the neurology clinic of an- other hospital because of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs, which oc- curred multiple times a day. The shaking occurred more frequently when the pa- tient was excited or emotional. He was aware of the shaking; he felt an urge before each episode, and the urge was relieved after the shaking occurred. His parents were told that the shaking was stereotypy, and no diagnostic tests were performed.\nThe patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his parents and two siblings in a suburban area of New England. He attended elementary school and performed well academically, although he re- ceived tutoring for mild difficulties with reading and phonology. In addition to the history of esophageal cancer in his paternal grandfather, his father had ulcerative colitis, his mother had received a diagnosis of large-B-cell lymphoma in childhood, his sister had asthma, and his mater- nal grandfather had died of acute coronary syn- drome at 30 years of age.\nOn evaluation, the patient appeared well developed and mildly anxious. The temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 91 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satu- ration 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The face was symmetric, with normal forehead wrinkling, blinking, smiling, and cheek puffing. An evaluation of other cranial-nerve functions, sensation, power, bulk, tone, coordination, and gait was normal.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Miya E. Bernson-Leung: In a 9-year-old boy with transient neurologic symptoms, the differential diagnosis is broad, encompassing relatively be- nign to potentially life-threatening entities. Even symptoms that have completely resolved by the time of presentation may be harbingers of a seri- ous condition. Because there were no observable signs when this patient presented to this hospi- tal, obtaining a careful history is crucial to the diagnostic reasoning process. To guide further evaluation and treatment, the clinician must simultaneously determine the type of disease process that may be occurring and the area in the nervous system that may be involved.\n\nNeurologic Symptoms\nA detailed description of the neurologic event (known as the semiology) should be obtained from the patient, his parents, and any other ob- servers. Useful descriptors include the duration and number of episodes; the tempo of onset and offset (abrupt or gradual); the evolution or se- quence of symptoms; the similarity of symptoms across episodes (variable or stereotyped), if ap- plicable; any prodromal or postdromal symp- toms, including both neurologic and systemic symptoms; and any provoking or ameliorating factors. It is important to understand specifi- cally what the patient or observer means when using terms such as pain, weakness, numbness, or dizziness. Finally, if the event has been re- corded, review of the video can be invaluable.\nOn the basis of the event description, the neurologic symptoms can be characterized as either focal or diffuse. This characterization may provide clues to the area involved. Focal symp- toms may point to a problem in a specific por- tion of the neuraxis. Diffuse symptoms, such as altered mental status, headache, or generalized weakness, are not as readily localized. Character- ization of the symptoms as focal or diffuse may also provide clues to the type of disease process. There are conditions that may cause focal symp- toms (e.g., trauma or vascular disease), condi- tions that tend to cause diffuse symptoms (e.g., toxic\u2013metabolic encephalopathy, systemic infec- tion, or inflammation), and conditions that can cause both (e.g., intracranial infection or some mass lesions).\nIt is also useful to characterize the neurologic symptoms as positive or negative. Excitatory processes such as seizure or migraine with aura tend to cause positive symptoms (or excesses), such as involuntary movements, olfactory hallu- cinations, paresthesias, or the scintillations and other visual phenomena of migraine with aura. Inhibitory processes such as demyelination or ischemia tend to produce negative symptoms (or deficits), such as weakness, dyscoordination, numbness (hypoesthesia or anesthesia), visual- field cuts, or loss of color perception. There are many exceptions to this broad rule, including postictal paralysis (Todd\u2019s paralysis) and hemi- plegic migraine with aura; in these cases and others, the history may indicate a mix of positive and negative symptoms.\nThis patient\u2019s history is notable for the development, when he was 7 years of age, of episodes of shaking in the arms and legs. The episodes oc- curred repeatedly throughout the day in a stereo- typed fashion, were associated with a prodromal urge and postdromal relief, and were exacerbated by excitement or strong emotion. These symptoms are focal and positive. They are consistent with motor tic disorder, a childhood movement disorder that is common, benign, and usually self-limited and can be diagnosed clinically.\nBy contrast, the symptoms described during this patient\u2019s current presentation were hemi- body weakness (hemiparesis) and slurred speech (dysarthria), which had a sudden onset, were preceded by crying and emotional upset, and resolved completely after 2 minutes without in- tervention. These symptoms are focal and nega- tive. The acute onset of focal neurologic deficits describes a strokelike episode, or brain attack.1\n\nBrain Attack\nSome brain attacks are caused by ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. However, similar presentations of acute focal neurologic deficits can have other causes, which can be broadly grouped into the following categories: electrochemical, pressure-mediated (including hemorrhagic stroke), toxic or metabolic, musculo- skeletal, infectious or inflammatory, and somato- form (Fig. 1). Many brain attacks are transient or fluctuating but can still progress to permanent injury. Also, many causes of brain attack are urgent or emergency conditions that require prompt treatment to prevent or minimize neuro- logic disability and other complications.1 These concerns have led to the development of brain- attack or stroke-alert rapid response teams at many pediatric centers.\nIn one series of 124 pediatric stroke-alert ac-\ntivations for acute focal neurologic deficits,2 30 (24%) were associated with a final diagnosis of stroke and 2 (2%) with a final diagnosis of tran- sient ischemic attack. Of the 21 patients with ischemic stroke, 3 were eligible for and under- went targeted therapy for hyperacute stroke (in- travenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator or endovascular thrombectomy). An additional 17 patients (14%) had other neuro- logic emergencies, a finding that highlights the importance of the rapid response pathway.\nThis patient had several clinical features sug- gestive of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. First, the sudden onset of focal deficits is the hallmark feature of both stroke and tran- sient ischemic attack, although progressive or fluctuating symptoms do not rule out these diag- noses, especially in younger patients.3,4 Second, there was no preceding convulsive activity suggestive of postictal paralysis. Third, the deficits could be localized to a single vascular territory. Arterial ischemic stroke is defined as the blockage of a cerebral blood vessel that leads to ischemia, and ultimately to irreversible infarc- tion, of the region of brain tissue supplied by that vessel. Transient ischemic attack involves the same process, but the process is reversed before progression to infarction, with complete resolution of symptoms. In either case, the con- stellation of deficits corresponds to the func- tions of the ischemic area (or areas). This patient had weakness of the face, arm, and leg on the left side, with dysarthria due to motor weakness of the face but without aphasia. This pure motor syndrome involves weakness of the entire hemi- body but spares language and visuospatial func- tions, pointing to ischemia of deep structures such as the internal capsule and adjacent basal ganglia, where the descending motor pathways are closely apposed. The affected region is sup- plied by small perforating branches off the\nmiddle cerebral arteries.\nArterial ischemic stroke results from one or more of three mechanisms (Fig. 2): thrombosis, stenosis, and thromboembolism. In thrombo- sis, there is an increased tendency toward the formation of blood clots. In stenosis, a cerebral artery becomes narrowed because of arterial dissection or intrinsic abnormalities of the vas- culature (e.g., moyamoya arteriopathy, sickle cell vasculopathy, or other arteriopathies), which can lead to downstream hypoperfusion. In thrombo- embolism, clots formed elsewhere in the body (a more proximal artery, the heart, or the venous circulation in the case of paradoxical embolism through an intracardiac shunt) move and be- come lodged in a cerebral artery. In children, these three mechanisms can have a variety of causes, including congenital or acquired arte- riopathies (inflammatory, infectious, traumat- ic, and other arteriopathies), cardiac disease, regional or systemic infection and inflamma- tion, and genetic or acquired thrombophilic conditions. In many cases, two or more associ- ated factors can be identified at the time of stroke.5\nNeuroimaging\nThe definitive test to establish the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic at- tack and to begin the assessment for underlying causes is neuroimaging with angiography of the head and neck. In children, the preferred tech- nique is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck. This approach can achieve the three goals of imaging for hyper- acute stroke while avoiding exposure to radiation and contrast material. First, diffusion-weighted MRI can show evidence of ischemia within min- utes of onset, whereas computed tomography (CT) may show no abnormalities in the early phase of stroke. Second, perfusion-weighted MRI and MRA can be used to identify vascular occlusions or abnormalities that confirm the diagnosis of stroke, may reveal an arteriopathy as an underly- ing cause, and may render the patient eligible for clot-directed therapies such as the intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator or thrombectomy. Third, susceptibility-weighted or gradient-echo MRI can be used to rule out hemorrhage; hemorrhagic stroke is high on the differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke and would require different management strategies.4 Even when the symptoms suspicious for transient ischemic attack have resolved, it is impor- tant to perform MRI with MRA to assess for ischemic injury (given that some pediatric strokes apparent on imaging have resolving symptoms) and to identify underlying causes that could lead to a future completed stroke.6,7\n\nMoyamoya Arteriopathy\nIn this patient, the fact that the episode of neuro- logic deficits was preceded by crying is notable. Crying may lead to hyperventilation, which is a known trigger for transient ischemic attack and stroke in children with moyamoya arteriopathy. This condition is a progressive steno-occlusive disease of the major cerebral vessels, with com- pensatory hyperplasia of perforating branches and other collateral vessels and ultimately failure of cerebral perfusion in affected vascular ter- ritories.8 When moyamoya arteriopathy is idiopathic, it is called moyamoya disease. When it occurs in the context of known associated con- ditions, such as sickle cell disease, cranial irra- diation, or Down syndrome, it is called moyamo- ya syndrome.\nIt is thought that the decreased partial pressure of carbon dioxide that occurs during hyper- ventilation leads to cerebral vasoconstriction, resulting in ischemia of areas with tenuous perfusion.9 This patient\u2019s hypertension at pre- sentation could reflect systemic compensation to maximize cerebral perfusion. In returning briefly to the patient\u2019s history of possible motor tics beginning when he was 7 years of age, mo- tor tics and other movement disorders, which are the hallmarks of basal ganglia abnormalities, have been described in patients with untreated moyamoya arteriopathy. They may resolve spontaneously or after revascularization  procedures This phenomenon may be due to the direct mass effect of collateral vessel proliferation on the basal ganglia or to abnormal basal ganglia perfu- sion even without infarction.11,12 In summary, this patient\u2019s history suggests that he had a tran- sient ischemic attack, possibly due to moyamoya disease. To establish the diagnosis of moyamoya disease in this case, neuroimaging with angiog- raphy should be performed.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Otto Rapalino: The patient underwent CT angi- ography of the head, which revealed focal severe stenosis of the terminus of the right internal carotid artery and of the adjacent proximal (A1) segment of the right anterior cerebral artery. In addition, the horizontal (M1) segment of the right middle cerebral artery appeared to be se- verely narrowed and was surrounded by promi- nent collateral vessels (Fig. 3A). The remaining intracranial arteries were patent, without focal stenosis. There was no evidence of hemorrhage or acute infarction on the initial CT images.\nSubsequent MRI of the head confirmed the absence of acute infarction and intracranial hemorrhage. Pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL) perfusion-weighted images showed asymmetri- cally increased signal intensity along the distal branches of the right middle cerebral artery, a finding that probably reflected an arterial tran- sit delay artifact and decreased signal intensity in the right frontal white matter (Fig. 3B). MRA confirmed the presence of focal severe narrow- ing of the terminus of the right internal ca- rotid artery and showed poor visualization of the adjacent right A1 and M1 segments, with re- placement of the right M1 segment with prominent collateral vessels in a moyamoya pattern.\nAfter MRI with MRA was performed, the patient underwent conventional transfemoral cere- bral angiography to further characterize the vas- cular findings. Conventional angiography revealed severe stenosis of the right M1 segment, mild tapering of the terminus of the right internal carotid artery, and a robust right superficial temporal artery (Fig. 3C).\n\nFigure 3 (facing page). Initial  Imaging  Studies. Shown are a coronal maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) reformatted image of the initial CT angiogram\n(Panel A), an axial pulsed arterial spin labeling (PASL)\nperfusion-weighted MRI (Panel B), and conventional frontal digital subtraction angiograms obtained during injection of contrast material into the right and left in- ternal carotid arteries (Panels C and D, respectively). The CT angiogram and a conventional angiogram show focal severe stenosis of the horizontal (M1) segment of the right middle cerebral artery (Panels A and C, arrows), which is surrounded by collateral vessels in a moyamoya pattern. The other conventional angiogram shows no abnormalities (Panel D). The PASL image shows multi- ple foci of increased signal intensity along the distal branches of the right middle cerebral artery (Panel B, arrowheads), a finding that probably reflects an arterial transit delay artifact and focal decreased signal intensity in the right frontal white matter.\n",
