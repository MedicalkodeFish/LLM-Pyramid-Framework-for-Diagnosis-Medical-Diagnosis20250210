    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Lila M. Martin (Medicine): A 52-year-old man was transferred to this hospital for evaluation and treatment of hypoxemia.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 7 days before transfer to this hospital, when nonproductive cough and intermittent fever with temperatures of up to 38.2\u00b0C developed. During the subsequent 4 days, these symptoms per- sisted and were accompanied by malaise, mild anorexia, weakness, and exertional dyspnea. He had no chest pain, palpitations, antecedent respiratory symptoms, rashes, joint symptoms, or weight loss. The administration of dextromethorphan and acetaminophen did not improve symptoms. On the morning before transfer to this hospital, dyspnea occurred with minimal exertion. The patient presented to a local urgent care clinic, where the heart rate was 113 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation was 91% while he was breathing ambient air. He was re- ferred to the emergency department at a local hospital for further evaluation.\nOn presentation to the other hospital, the temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 115 beats per minute, the blood pressure 126/83 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation was 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 93% while he was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. No jugular venous disten- tion or increased work of breathing was reported. Auscultation of the chest re- vealed rhonchi and occasional wheezes on the right side and a prominent systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border. The remainder of the examination was normal. The N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide level was 4850 pg per mil- liliter (reference range, 0 to 900), the d-dimer level 2487 ng per milliliter (reference range, <244), and the lactate dehydrogenase level 458 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of the blood were obtained.\nDr. Milena Petranovi\u0107: Initial posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs (Fig. 1A\nand 1B) showed markedly asymmetric lung opacities located predominantly in the central portion of the right upper lobe.\nDr. Rajeev Malhotra: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2A) showed sinus tachycardia with left axis deviation, left atrial abnormality, early R-wave progression, and ST-segment depressions in the anterior leads. Bedside ultrasonographic exami- nation of the heart revealed a hyperdynamic left ventricle.\nDr. Martin: Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and intravenous normal saline were administered, and the administration of supple- mental oxygen through a nasal cannula was continued. The patient was admitted to the in- tensive care unit (ICU) of the other hospital.\nThat afternoon, 5 hours after presentation to the other hospital, hypoxemia worsened; the oxygen saturation was 86% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute, and the respiratory rate was 34 breaths per minute. The levels im- proved after the administration of additional supplemental oxygen; the oxygen saturation in- creased to 92% while he was receiving oxygen through a nonrebreather face mask at a rate of 15 liters per minute and then increased to 100% while he was receiving oxygen through a high- f low nasal cannula at a rate of 60 liters per minute (fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2], 1.0), and the respiratory rate decreased to 28 breaths per minute.\nDr. Petranovi\u0107: A portable chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) showed persistent asymmetric lung opacities. Also seen were new septal lines, in- creased thickening of the right minor fissure, and increased perihilar haziness.\nDr. Martin: Eight hours after presentation to the other hospital, worsening shortness of breath developed, along with diaphoresis. On ex- amination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 146 beats per minute, the blood pressure 150/76  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  46  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while he was receiving oxygen through a non- rebreather face mask (Fio2, 1.0). Rapid antigen testing for influenza types A and B was negative. A trial of noninvasive positive-pressure ven- tilation was performed, but respiratory distress persisted. The trachea was intubated, and copi- ous frothy secretions were noted. Mechanical pressure-control ventilation was initiated (inspi- ratory pressure, 15 cm of water; positive end- expiratory pressure [PEEP], 10 cm of water; Fio2, 1.0; respiratory rate, 14 breaths per minute; peak inspiratory pressure, 31 cm of water). Propofol was administered. Hypoxemia persisted despite the use of mechanical ventilation, deep suction- ing, and recruitment maneuvers; paralysis with an infusion of cisatracurium was begun. Flexible bronchoscopy revealed a normal-appearing air- way with pink frothy secretions, without puru- lent exudates or bleeding; bronchial washings and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were obtained for microbiologic testing. A central venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein; the central venous pressure was not recorded.\nDr. Malhotra: A repeat electrocardiogram (Fig. 2B) showed sinus tachycardia with left axis deviation and moderate improvement in the pre- viously observed ST-segment depressions in the anterior leads.\nDr. Martin: Glucocorticoids and intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin, trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole, and furosemide were admin- istered. On serial arterial blood gas analyses performed over a 12-hour period, the patient had a pH as low as 7.11, a partial pressure of oxygen of 45 to 74 mm Hg, an oxygen saturation of 86 to 89% while he was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (Fio2, 1.0), and persistent tachycardia at a rate of 120 to 150 beats per minute. Early the following morning, he was trans- ferred by ambulance to the ICU of this hospital.\nOn presentation to this hospital, additional information was obtained from the patient\u2019s partner. The patient had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, benign prostatic hypertro- phy, and hemorrhoids. He had undergone tonsil- lectomy but no other surgeries. His outpatient medications included atorvastatin, hydrochloro- thiazide, inhaled fluticasone, and hydrocortisone rectal cream, but he had not been taking any medications regularly. He had no known aller- gies to medications. His father had died of a myocardial infarction at 61 years of age, and two paternal uncles had also died of coronary artery disease, one in the fifth decade and one in the sixth decade. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. He had a long-term male partner but was not sexually active. He worked at a university. He had traveled to Wash- ington, D.C., the week before presentation.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C,\nthe heart rate 98 beats per minute, the blood pressure 116/77 mm Hg, and the oxygen satura- tion 93% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechanical ventilator (tidal volume, 420 ml; PEEP, 15 cm of water; Fio2, 1.0; respira-\ntory rate, 28 breaths per minute; plateau pressure, 26 cm of water). The central venous pressure ranged from 12 to 15 cm of water. Auscultation of the chest revealed regular heart sounds, a systolic murmur (grade 3/6) that was best heard at the right upper sternal border, and scant rales and rhonchi bilaterally. The arms and legs were warm, without edema; faint areas of livedo re- ticularis were noted, but no rashes were seen. The remainder of the examination was normal. Tests for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens in the urine were negative, as were polymerase-chain-reaction tests for influenza types A and B and respiratory syn- cytial virus in BAL samples. Tests for adenovirus and parainfluenza virus antigens in the sputum and human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen and antibodies in the blood were negative. Gram\u2019s staining of the BAL samples revealed few neutrophils and no organisms. The C-reac- tive protein level was 333.0 mg per liter (reference range, <8.0);  other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Malhotra: An electrocardiogram (Fig. 2C) showed normal sinus rhythm with early R-wave progression and resolution of the previously ob- served ST-segment depressions.\nDr. Petranovi\u0107: A portable chest radiograph (Fig. 1D) showed increased perivascular haziness diffusely, with a more widespread distribution of the previously seen opacities, which remained most dense in the right upper lobe. There was also new blunting of the left costophrenic angle. The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, esoph- ageal temperature probe, and central venous catheter were in the appropriate positions.\nDr. Martin: When the patient had arrived at this hospital, the ventilator mode had been switched to volume-controlled ventilation for lung protection, and the PEEP increased. The dose of cisatracurium was increased, and an in- travenous hydromorphone infusion was started to optimize patient\u2013ventilator synchrony. Four hours after arrival, the administration of inhaled nitric oxide was initiated. Eight hours after ar- rival, the Fio2 was decreased from 1.0 to 0.4.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Charles C. Hardin: This 52-year-old man pre- sented with low-grade fever, hypoxemia, and a pulmonary infiltrate that was initially confined to the right upper lobe. In critical care, we fre- quently construct a differential diagnosis around the most life-threatening organ failure, which in this case is hypoxemia. Possible causes of hypox- emia include a low partial pressure of inspired oxygen (Pio2), diffusion limitation, hypoventila-\ntion, ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, and shunt.1\nThree of these causes of hypoxemia can be ruled out quickly in this patient. A low Pio2 is typically observed at high altitude, and it would\nbe observed at sea level only in an unusual set of circumstances. Diffusion limitation \u2014 failure of equilibration between the partial pressure of oxygen in the pulmonary end-capillary blood and the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen \u2014 occurs infrequently at rest. It typically occurs at high altitude and during high levels of exercise, as well as during low levels of exercise in patients with interstitial lung diseases.2 Isolated hypo- ventilation results in hypoxemia with a normal alveolar\u2013arterial gradient.3 In this patient, the alveolar\u2013arterial gradient is markedly elevated and the partial pressure of arterial carbon diox- ide is low, findings that rule out hypoventilation as the cause of hypoxemia. We are therefore left with ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch and shunt, either alone or in combination, as possible causes of this patient\u2019s life-threatening illness.\n The arterial oxygen content reflects the bal- ance between air f low (ventilation) and blood flow (perfusion) into the alveolar air spaces. The ratio of these flows, known as the ventilation\u2013 perfusion ratio, is low when the balance is tipped toward perfusion and is high when the balance is tipped toward ventilation.4 When the ventilation\u2013 perfusion ratio is low or high, ventilation\u2013perfu- sion mismatch occurs. A low ratio can lead to arterial hypoxemia.\nThis patient initially had a response to sup- plemental oxygen. Such a response classically rules out the presence of a shunt,5 but multiple mechanisms of hypoxemia may coexist.6,7 The response to supplemental oxygen, however, indi- cates the presence of a low ventilation\u2013perfusion ratio in at least some lung units, or areas of the lung, so we may construct our differential diag- nosis on the basis of this finding.\nWhy does this patient have a low ventilation\u2013 perfusion ratio in some lung units? In the pres- ence of a pulmonary infiltrate, we can infer that he has had a loss of alveolar stability and a subsequent decrease in ventilation. Loss of alveo- lar stability may occur when fluid enters the air spaces and disrupts the balance of forces at the air\u2013liquid interface, which is facilitated by sur- factant. This may result from increased perme- ability of the alveolar\u2013capillary membrane (in noncardiogenic edema) or elevated pulmonary venous pressure (in cardiogenic edema). Depend- ing on the severity of the disturbance, the end result is either a low ventilation\u2013perfusion ratio or a fully developed intrapulmonary shunt, in which blood flows to a completely nonaerated lung unit.5 Possible causes of a low ventilation\u2013perfusion ratio in this patient include community-acquired pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary embolism, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema from either heart failure or valve dysfunc- tion, particularly mitral regurgitation.8\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia\nThis patient presented with low-grade fever, an elevated C-reactive protein level, and a pulmonary infiltrate. However, a comprehensive infectious workup was performed and was negative. He could have pneumonia caused by an organism that is hard to identify or cannot be identified because of the rapid initiation of antibiotic therapy, but this diagnosis is unlikely. Therefore, although pneu- monia is possible, it is relegated to a low posi- tion in my differential diagnosis.\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\nARDS is a classic cause of noncardiogenic pul- monary edema.9 Defining features of ARDS in- clude an acute onset of illness, hypoxemia, and a bilateral infiltrate. In patients with ARDS, severe hypoxemia is most frequently associated with a concordant severe decrease in lung compliance and a widespread pulmonary infiltrate. We are told that after the ventilator mode was switched to volume-controlled ventilation, this patient had a plateau pressure of 26 cm of water and a PEEP of 15 cm of water. The driving pressure (the difference between the plateau pressure and the PEEP) of only 11 cm of water and the tidal vol- ume of 420 ml suggest a disconnect between the severe hypoxemia and the moderate disturbance in lung compliance.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\nPulmonary embolus can lead to a low ventila- tion\u2013perfusion ratio, since the cardiac output is redirected from affected lung units. However, it does not commonly result in an infiltrate, and the infiltrate seen in this patient is not classic for a pulmonary infarct. In addition, there is no history suggestive of a prothrombotic state. Therefore, pulmonary embolus is unlikely in this case.\nInterstitial Lung Disease\nInterstitial lung disease can be acute under some circumstances. Acute interstitial pneumonia, or- ganizing pneumonia, and acute eosinophilic pneumonia can also mimic an acute infectious process. However, this patient has no specific imaging findings or history that would be con- sistent with interstitial lung disease, and the fact that the disease is acute also makes this diagnosis unlikely.\n\nPulmonary Hemorrhage\nPatients with pulmonary hemorrhage can pres- ent with an infiltrate and hypoxemia. Pulmonary hemorrhage classically results from the various causes of pulmonary capillaritis, but coagulopa- thy can also lead to hemorrhage. The diagnosis is based on the progressive presence of blood in BAL fluid, which was not found in this patient; the absence of this finding rules out this diag- nosis.\n\nCardiogenic Pulmonary Edema\nAcute causes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema include acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, and acute valvular heart disease, specifi- cally acute mitral regurgitation. Acute systolic dysfunction that results in an elevated pulmo- nary capillary wedge pressure (either ischemia or an acute exacerbation of chronic systolic dys- function) is not consistent with the presence of a hyperdynamic left ventricle on bedside ultraso- nographic examination. Hypertrophic obstruc- tive cardiomyopathy would be consistent with the hyperdynamic left ventricle and can result in an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and systolic murmur. However, acute onset is rare and is more often associated with hypoten- sion and hypoxemia than with isolated hypox- emia. Moreover, in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, hypoxemia is often associated with mitral regurgitation. Mitral ste- nosis and tachycardia can lead to pulmonary edema and hypoxemia but would typically be associated with a diastolic murmur.\nThe diagnosis of acute mitral regurgitation\nmay be supported by certain aspects of the his- tory, such as the systolic murmur, which may be the murmur associated with regurgitant flow. The fact that the murmur was heard best at the right upper sternal border may reflect severe mitral regurgitation that is directed anteriorly,possibly toward the right upper pulmonary vein. Patients with acute mitral regurgitation can pre- sent with an asymmetric pulmonary infiltrate, which develops when an eccentric regurgitant jet leads to differential pressures in the pulmonary veins and disproportionate regional edema.10 The hyperdynamic left ventricle on bedside ultraso- nography is also consistent with acute mitral regurgitation. Finally, acute mitral regurgitation can be associated with severe hypoxemia, since the increase in volume results in a large increase in pressure in the relatively noncompliant left atrium. I suspect that acute mitral regurgitation is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s pulmo- nary edema and hypoxemia. To confirm this diagnosis, I would obtain a formal transthoracic echocardiogram.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sheila Klassen: A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained on hospital day 2 showed hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. A large portion of the posterior mitral leaflet was flail (Fig. 3A; and Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Mobile linear echodensities that represented ruptured chordae were seen pro- lapsing into the left atrium (Fig. 3B). The mitral valve did not have a classic myxomatous appear- ance. There was anteriorly directed mitral regur- gitation, which was severe according to both color Doppler assessment and quantitative mea- sures. The image quality was not adequate to assess for flow reversal in the pulmonary veins; however, on color Doppler, flow was directed to- ward the right upper pulmonary vein (Video 2). The left atrium was dilated, and the interatrial septum was bowed rightward. The mean gradient across the mitral valve (measured at a heart rate of 100 beats per minute) was 6 mm Hg, indicat- ing high transmitral flow. On spectral Doppler sampling, estimated velocities in the left ven- tricular outflow tract indicated a low forward stroke volume (Fig. 3C), a finding that reflects the severity of mitral regurgitation. There was pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 79 mm Hg (Fig. 3D), as well as mild-to-moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular systolic function was normal; there were no regional wall-motion abnormalities or vegetations on the cardiac valves, and there was no pericardial effusion.",
