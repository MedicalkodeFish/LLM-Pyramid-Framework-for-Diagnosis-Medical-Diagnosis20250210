    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Joshua Salvi (Medicine): A 66-year-old man with a history of pancytopenia was transferred to this hospital in the winter for evaluation of pancytopenia and rash. The patient had been well until 1 year before admission, when episodic fevers began to occur. Approximately 3 months before admission, fevers with a tempera- ture of up to 38.3\u00b0C increased in frequency and severity and coincided with shak- ing chills. Scattered papules developed on the arms and legs; the lesions were initially deeply erythematous, but over a period of several days, the discoloration faded and the skin sloughed. There was no associated pruritus, and febrile epi-\nsodes did not coincide with worsening of the skin lesions.\nTwo months before admission, episodes of orthostatic hypotension and dizzi- ness developed. The patient was admitted to other hospitals on two occasions for recurrent lightheadedness. Laboratory evaluation reportedly revealed a normal level of corticotropin in the blood and a normal increase in the serum cortisol level after intravenous administration of cosyntropin. The white-cell count was 850 per microliter (reference range, 4200 to 9900), the hemoglobin level 9.2 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.0 to 17.4), the platelet count 61,000 per microliter (reference range, 140,000 to 440,000), and the mean corpuscular volume 89 fl (reference range, 82 to 100). The blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine amino- transferase were elevated. Serologic tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2 were negative. The fer- ritin level was 12,620 ng per milliliter (reference range, 30 to 400), but subsequent testing for the HFE mutation most often associated with hemochromatosis was negative. Nineteen days before the ferritin level was measured, the iron level was 67 \u03bcg per deciliter (12 \u03bcmol per liter) (reference range, 45 to 182 \u03bcg per deciliter [8 to 33 \u03bcmol per liter]), the total iron-binding capacity 143 \u03bcg per deciliter (26 \u03bcmol per liter) (reference range, 261 to 478 \u03bcg per deciliter [47 to 86 \u03bcmol per liter]), the transferrin saturation 47% (reference range, 20 to 55), the folate level 18.3 ng per milliliter (41 nmol per liter) (reference range, 6 to 20 ng per milliliter [14 to 45 nmol per liter]), and the vitamin B12 level 861 pg per milliliter (635 pmol per liter) (reference range, 193 to 986 pg per milliliter [142 to 727 pmol per liter]). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a small amount of pericholecystic fluid and mild edema in the right paracolic gut- ter that suggested an infiltrative process; the biliary ducts appeared normal, and no intrahepatic iron deposition was seen. The orthostatic hypotension abated, but did not fully resolve, after the administration of intravenous f luids. The patient was discharged home and was in- structed to follow up with his primary care physician.\nEight days before admission, orthostatic hypo- tension recurred. The patient was readmitted to one of the other hospitals, where he reported on- going lightheadedness and generalized weakness. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the pulse 91 beats per  minute,  the  blood  pressure  119/71  mm  Hg while the patient was in the supine position (75/48  while  he  was  standing),  the  respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, the oxygen satura- tion 95% while he was breathing ambient air, and the weight 74.9 kg. He was pale, appeared ill, and had marked edema of the legs and peri- orbital region. Scattered nummular and erosive lesions with overlying eschar were noted on both feet, both forearms, and the medial right thigh; petechiae were also seen on the arms and chest. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. An antibody-based screening test for Lyme disease was negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesia, ehrlichia, anaplasma, adenovirus, and cytomega- lovirus. Histoplasma and aspergillus antigens were not detected in the blood. Cultures of the blood were negative.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram was of technically poor quality but showed normal biven- tricular function; valvular dysfunction was not assessed. Radiography of the chest revealed atelec- tasis but was otherwise normal. Computed to- mography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small bilateral pleural effusions and no evidence of lymphadenopathy; CT of the abdo- men and pelvis revealed normal hepatic paren- chyma, a moderate amount of ascites, mild splenomegaly, and no evidence of lymphade- nopathy. Positron-emission tomography (PET) from the skull base to the thighs, performed after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluoro- deoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed homoge- neous FDG uptake in the spleen, and there was no evidence of hypermetabolism in the abdomi- nal or pelvic lymph nodes.\nThe patient was transferred to this hospital for further evaluation and management of possi- ble hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Dr. Valentina Nardi: Examination of a bone marrow biopsy specimen and aspirate that were obtained at the other hospital revealed maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and mildly hypercellu- lar marrow with many histiocytes and numerous engulfed erythroid elements in the cytoplasm. The findings were consistent with hemophago- cytosis, with no evidence of infection or lymphoma (Fig. 1).\nDr. Kristine M. Cornejo: A punch biopsy of an erythematous lesion on the right thigh was per- formed at the other hospital. Microscopic exami- nation of the specimen revealed focal epidermal erosion with impetiginized scale crust and a mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue; no fungal organisms were identified. The infiltrate lacked atypia, and there was no evidence of hemophagocytosis. The findings were nondiagnostic, and there was no evidence of lymphoma (Fig. 2).\n\nTable 1.

Leick: The patient had been healthy until 2 years before admission. On admission to this hospital, the patient reported ongoing swell- ing in the legs, forearms, and periorbital area, along with decreased appetite and poor oral in- take. He had a history of coronary artery dis- ease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroid- ism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had received a diagnosis of pancytopenia 2 years earlier and had undergone an extensive evalua- tion 1 year after the diagnosis; results of serum protein electrophoresis and the serum free light- chain ratio had been normal, and examination of a biopsy specimen of the bone marrow had revealed no evidence of cancer. Medications in- cluded pantoprazole, levothyroxine, lisinopril, metoprolol, and aspirin; treatment with amoxi- cillin caused nausea, and treatment with simva- statin caused myalgia.\nThe patient was single and lived alone in a\nrural area of New England. He had previously worked in health care but had retired several years before admission. He smoked three cigars daily and did not drink alcohol or use  illicit drugs. His father had died from coronary artery disease, and his brother had sarcoidosis and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; an aunt and uncle had had cancer, but the types were unknown.\nOn examination, the patient appeared frail. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 119/74 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, the weight 78.6 kg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. Periorbital edema and purpura were seen, along with well- circumscribed erosions and nodules on both legs, with overlying crust in various stages of healing. The abdomen was soft, with no tenderness or organomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The ferritin level was 29,600 ng per milli- liter. The soluble CD25 level in the blood was elevated, at 8635 pg per milliliter (reference range, 532 to 1891). The blood level of interferon-\u03b3 was high (>520 pg per milliliter). Nucleic acid testing of the blood for EBV DNA was positive, at 1340 IU per milliliter, and nucleic acid testing for human herpesvirus 6 and parvovirus was negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis was negative, and antibodies to herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and to toxoplasma were not detected.\nGiven the finding of periorbital edema, a CT scan of the face, obtained without the adminis- tration of intravenous contrast material, showed ill-defined areas of increased attenuation along the preseptal soft tissues and within the inferior orbital areas bilaterally, with no signs of a focal drainable collection. Magnetic resonance imag- ing of the face and orbits was performed before and after the administration of intravenous con- trast material. A T2-weighted image obtained with short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) param- eters showed signal hyperintensity within the bilateral preseptal soft tissues, right lateral pterygoid and temporalis muscles with associated signal hyperintensity along the fascial planes of the extraocular muscles, and asymmetric mild enlargement and enhancement of the left supe- rior oblique, medial, and lateral recti.\nTwo days after the patient\u2019s admission to this hospital, fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a fat pad was performed, and pathological examination of the specimen revealed no evidence of malignant cells; staining with Congo red was negative for amyloid. Results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal, and serum free light chains were not detected. Treatment with oral dexametha- sone was initiated.\nEight days after the patient\u2019s admission, the ferritin level decreased to 15,846 ng per milli- liter (reference range, 20 to 300), but pancytope- nia persisted. Nine days after admission, ruxoli- tinib was administered. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, has shown success in murine models of HLH, with decreased interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-6, and interleukin-12 and decreased symptoms, and has been used successfully in humans. During the next 7 days, the patient noted increasing energy, decreased edema in the legs, and resolution of fever. The blood ferritin level further decreased to 2759 ng per milliliter, but pancytopenia and neutropenia persisted 3 weeks after the treatment course with dexa- methasone and ruxolitinib had begun.\nA repeat bone marrow biopsy was performed.\nThe marrow was markedly hypocellular (cellu- larity <1% in the core specimen), with patchy serous atrophy; no hemophagocytic histiocytes were seen. Immunohistochemical examination revealed many scattered T cells and occasional B cells. Treatment with dexamethasone was con- tinued, but ruxolitinib treatment was discontin- ued. The day after treatment with ruxolitinib was discontinued, fevers recurred, and the blood ferritin level had increased to 4188 ng per milli- liter; the neutrophil count had not increased.",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Maus: What triggered this patient\u2019s HLH syn- drome? A standard workup for hematologic can- cer, including imaging studies and bone marrow biopsy, was negative except for an increase in FDG uptake in the spleen, which was slightly enlarged. There are rare hematologic cancers that are characterized by an absence of lymph- adenopathy or bone marrow involvement but may nevertheless trigger HLH.\n\nExtranodal Lymphoma\nApproximately 10 to 35% of patients with non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma present with extranodal disease at the time of diagnosis.6 The most com- mon sites of involvement are the gastrointestinal tract, skin, testes, bones, kidneys, and central nervous system. However, most extranodal lym- phomas also have FDG avidity; the lymphomas without FDG avidity include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobulinemia, marginal-zone lymphoma, and some T-cell lym- phomas.7,8 Among these non-FDG\u2013avid lympho- mas, only splenic marginal-zone lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas typically manifest with extra- nodal disease. Splenic marginal-zone lymphoma involves the spleen, but the disease is indolent, is associated with autoimmune disease, and rare- ly causes B symptoms (i.e., weight loss, night sweats, and fever) or acute illness, characteris- tics that do not fit this patient\u2019s presentation. Therefore, the most likely underlying trigger is a T-cell lymphoma.\n\nT-Cell Lymphoma\nPeripheral T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of rare but generally aggressive cancers. The most common peripheral T-cell lymphoma is a \u201cnot otherwise specified\u201d subtype, but multiple subtypes exist, including anaplastic large-cell lymphoma; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma; hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma; enteropathy- associated T-cell lymphoma; extranodal NK T-cell lymphoma, nasal type; subcutaneous panniculitis- like T-cell lymphoma; and primary cutaneous gamma\u2013delta T-cell lymphoma. The potential diagnosis of extranodal NK T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, should be considered in this patient because it is an EBV-associated lymphoma that is characterized by germline T-cell\u2013receptor T cells that express CD56 and lack CD8, with positive staining for EBV-encoded RNA in the tumor cells. Scans obtained in this patient did show abnormal signal intensity in the nasal cavity, and this disease can also involve the skin; however, the disease typically manifests with a symptom- atic midfacial mass. Approximately 3% of pa- tients who have NK T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, also present with HLH. However, this subtype of lymphoma typically has FDG avidity on PET, and the patient had neither a symptomatic nasal mass nor clinically significant FDG-avid disease. One of the patient\u2019s primary symptoms was a scaling erythematous rash on the legs, so cuta- neous T-cell lymphoma seems quite likely, despite the rarity of this disease. Subcutaneous pannicu- litis-like T-cell lymphoma manifests with pain- less subcutaneous nodules or plaques involving the legs (occurring in 71% of patients), arms (62%), trunk (56%), and face (25%).9,10 A wax- ing and waning course is typical, with lesions in various stages of growth and remission. Ap- proximately 20% of patients have a history of autoimmune disease. In patients with subcuta- neous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, it is unusual for the lymphoma to be present in areas other than the skin, although the bone marrow can harbor hemophagocytes. Pathological exami- nation of skin lesions typically reveals cellular infiltrates composed of T cells and histiocytes in the subcutaneous fat. The tumorigenic cells associated with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma arise from a mature cytotoxic T cell. The World Health Organization originally characterized the tumorigenic T cells as having clonal rearrangements of either the alpha\u2013beta or the gamma\u2013delta T-cell receptor, but subcuta- neous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma has now been redefined such that the disease is restricted to primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas that have clonal rearrangements of the alpha\u2013beta T-cell receptor.9 The other immunophenotypic features of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lym- phoma tumors include CD3+, CD8+, CD4\u2212, and CD56\u2212, as well as positivity for granzyme B, perforin, T-cell receptor alpha\u2013beta, and T-cell intracellular antigen. The in situ hybridization analysis for EBV-encoded RNA is negative. Ap- proximately 17% of patients with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma present with secondary HLH, and these patients have a worse prognosis than those who do not present with secondary HLH.\nIn patients with subcutaneous panniculitis- like T-cell lymphoma, the lesions typically involve only the subcutaneous fat. The erythematous scaling of the nodules in this patient suggests that his lesions involved the dermis and epidermis and not just the subcutaneous fat. This characteristic is commonly seen in primary cuta- neous gamma\u2013delta T-cell lymphoma, which represents less than 1% of all cases of cutaneous lymphomas. Gamma\u2013delta T cells arise from double-negative thymocytes early in T-cell devel- opment and form part of the innate immune system. Unlike alpha\u2013beta T-cell receptors, gamma\u2013 delta T-cell receptors are not restricted by the HLA; instead, they recognize lipid antigens or microbial compounds. Gamma\u2013delta T cells make up less than 5% of circulating lymphocytes but are abundant in the skin and gut. They may pro- liferate in response to infections, such as tuber- culosis, listeria, and malaria.\nIn a series of 20 patients with confirmed pri- mary cutaneous gamma\u2013delta T-cell lymphoma, 70% presented with HLH symptoms. I suspect that in the case of primary cutaneous gamma\u2013 delta T-cell lymphoma, it is the autonomous T-cell proliferation and aberrant cytokine production that drive the HLH symptomatology, including macrophage activation (Fig. 3). This disease is very aggressive and portends a poor prognosis, regardless of the presence of HLH symptoms.9 Aside from the clonal gamma\u2013delta T-cell recep- tor gene rearrangements, no characteristic muta- tions in primary cutaneous gamma\u2013delta T-cell lymphoma have been defined, although complex cytogenetic features have been reported.\nGiven the combination of the patient\u2019s HLH\nsymptoms and laboratory findings, the absence of lymphadenopathy, and the presence of cuta- neous lesions, I favor the diagnosis of primary cutaneous gamma\u2013delta T-cell lymphoma mani- festing with HLH syndrome. I would recom- mend a biopsy of a nodule on the left thigh that would include the subcutaneous fat, and I would perform immunohistochemical testing for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, and T-cell receptors alpha\u2013 beta and gamma\u2013delta, along with T-cell recep- tor clonality and genetic testing of both the germline and the tumor.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Cornejo: A skin biopsy specimen obtained at this hospital from the medial left thigh showed an atypical proliferation of medium-to-large pleomorphic cells in the dermis and subcutane- ous tissue that was associated with prominent karyorrhexis (Fig. 4A). Mild interface changes of the epidermis with ulceration were also identi- fied. The infiltrate was angiocentric and angio- destructive; it surrounded and infiltrated the vessel walls and was associated with fibrin thrombi (Fig. 4B and 4C). There was no evidence of hemophagocytosis.\n\nFigure 4. Subsequent Biopsy Specimen of the Skin, Obtained at This Hospital.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining of a biopsy specimen of a skin lesion on the left thigh shows a denser prolif\u2011 eration of atypical medium to large lymphocytes in the dermis and subcutis than was seen in the initial biopsy specimen (Panel A), with evidence of karyorrhectic de\u2011 bris, fibrin thrombi (Panel B, arrows), and angioinvasion and angiodestruction (Panel C). Immunohistochemical stains show that the neoplastic cells are CD3+ T cells (Panel D), with loss of CD4 (Panel E), CD8 (Panel F), and CD5 (not shown). The atypical lymphocytes also ex\u2011 press CD56 (Panel G), perforin (Panel H), and granzyme B (not shown). Beta F1 (Panel I) and T\u2011cell receptor delta (Panel J) are coexpressed.\n\nImmunohistochemical stains showed that the neoplastic cells were CD3+ T cells, with retained coexpression of CD2, and with loss of CD4, CD8, and CD5 (Fig. 4D, 4E, and 4F). Rare scattered CD20+ B cells were also seen. The lymphocytes expressed CD56, as well as cytotoxic proteins granzyme B and perforin (Fig. 4G and 4H). Im- munohistochemical staining for CD68 identified scattered intermixed histiocytes, and staining for CD30 highlighted rare inflammatory cells. In situ hybridization was negative for EBV-encoded RNA. Beta F1 (an antibody for the T-cell beta chain antigen receptor) and T-cell receptor delta staining were both positive in the atypical lym- phocytes (Fig. 4I and 4J). Molecular studies showed the presence of a clonal T-cell receptor gamma chain gene rearrangement. The morpho- logic features and immunophenotype in conjunc- tion with the molecular findings were consistent with primary cutaneous gamma\u2013delta T-cell lym- phoma. Coexpression of beta F1 and T-cell re- ceptor delta on immunohistochemical testing has been previously reported.",
