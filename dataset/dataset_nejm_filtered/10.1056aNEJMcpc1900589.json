    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Doll L. Golden (Medicine): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of falls, weakness, dark urine, and difficulty swallowing.\nApproximately 35 years before the current admission, the patient underwent staged male-to-female sex reassignment surgery at another hospital, with orchiec- tomy, penectomy, and urethral fixation, followed by scrotoplasty and vaginal construction. Estrogen therapy was prescribed.\nSeventeen months before the current admission, a friend found the patient on the floor of her apartment, unable to speak or to move her face, arm, or leg on the left side. Emergency medical services took the patient to a second hospital, where computed tomographic (CT) angiography reportedly revealed changes con- sistent with ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. Six hours later, the patient was transferred to this hospital. Examination revealed aphasia and weakness of the face, arm, and leg on the left side.\nDr. Ajay K. Singh: CT angiography performed at the second hospital had shown a lack of opacification of the right middle cerebral artery. On the same day, mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and magnetic resonance angiography performed at this hospital (Fig. 1A) confirmed the presence of acute ischemic stroke in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery. There was occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery, which had caused acute infarction of the right supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, insula, corona radiata, and putamen, with small hemorrhages in the corona radiata and putamen. Diffusion-weighted MRI (Fig. 1B) revealed restricted diffusion in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery.\nDr. Golden: Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 32% and dilatation of the left atrium and left ventricle, without intra- cardiac thrombus, valvular disease, or intracardiac shunting. Cardiac MRI revealed late gadolinium enhancement in a linear pattern in the subepicardial and midwall areas, spanning multiple coronary distributions, a finding that is most consistent with previous myocarditis. A cardioembolic mechanism of stroke was suspect- ed; estrogen therapy was stopped, and aspirin, atorvastatin, and furosemide were started. Six weeks later, residual weakness of the left bicep and hip flexor persisted; warfarin was started.\nSix months before the current admission, the patient presented to this hospital with a fall and worsening of weakness on the left side, which followed 2 weeks of coryza, nonproductive cough, dyspnea on exertion, and edema of the legs. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Singh: Magnetic resonance angiography and CT angiography revealed changes consistent with chronic infarcts in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery but no acute infarction. Ultrasonography of the legs and CT performed with a pulmonary-embolism protocol after the administration of intravenous contrast material were negative for thrombus.\nDr. Golden: Transthoracic echocardiography re- vealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 31%, and coronary angiography revealed normal coro- nary arteries. A device for cardiac resynchroni- zation therapy was implanted.\nThe dyspnea on exertion improved, but then 3 months before the current admission, insidious progressive generalized weakness and fatigue developed. The patient noted that basic daily activities, such as getting dressed, were \u201cburden- some\u201d and caused \u201cexhaustion.\u201d Two weeks be- fore the current admission, she had difficulty swallowing a communion wafer at church, and later that night, she had difficulty swallowing solids and liquids. Dysphagia persisted; she ate soft foods such as bread and peanut butter and would cough after sipping liquids. Weakness increased, and she had muscle pains; she had difficulty hanging up coats, standing up from a seated position (which led her to use her arms to pull herself up), putting on shoes and socks, and lifting her leg to get into a car. One week before the current admission, she had a mechan- ical fall in which her legs felt weak and \u201cgave out.\u201d She fell onto her left side and was on the ground for approximately 15 minutes. She was evaluated by emergency medical services but was not taken to the hospital. Four days later, she noted darkening of her urine, and a friend thought she had a transient episode of slurred speech. After friends noticed other episodes of slurred speech and the patient had further pro- gression of weakness, she was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems revealed urinary urgency, bowel movements with soft stool every 2 to 3 days, and chronic mild pruritus on the back. The pa- tient reported that she had had early satiety and overall disinterest in food since the stroke, and she had lost 24 kg. She reported no fevers, chills, night sweats, vision changes, diplopia, difficulty hearing, ataxia, numbness, headache, dyspnea, wheezing, orthopnea, odynophagia, dysuria, nau- sea, vomiting, new rash, or bruising.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history included hyper- tension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, glaucoma, ileus (which had led to sigmoidoscopy and intes- tinal decompression), colonic polyps (which had led to polypectomy), and degenerative disease of the cervical spine. Medications included aspirin, apixaban, atorvastatin, furosemide, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate, metoprolol succinate, spirono- lactone, docusate, and omeprazole, as well as latanoprost and timolol eye drops. Angiotensin- converting\u2013enzyme inhibitors had caused angio- edema, and heparin had caused immune throm- bocytopenia. The patient had not recently traveled outside New England; she lived alone and worked as an administrator. She walked with a cane at baseline. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, over-the-counter or herbal medications, or illicit substances. Her father had died of myo- cardial infarction at 79 years of age, her mother had hypertension and osteoarthritis that had led to a hip replacement, her brother had received a diagnosis of prostate cancer when he was in his 50s, and her sister had sarcoidosis.\nThe patient appeared thin and had mild dysarthria. The temperature was 37.4\u00b0C, the pulse 67 beats per minute, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while she was breath- ing ambient air. The abdomen was protuberant but soft and nontender. Neurologic examination was notable for reduced strength in the upper arms, with 4/5 strength in the left deltoid, triceps, and biceps and 4+/5 strength in the same muscle groups on the right side. Grip strength was 4+/5 bilaterally. There was reduced strength in the legs,  with  5\u2212/5  hip  flexion  bilaterally  and  5\u2212/5 knee extension and flexion on the left side. Ankle dorsif lexion and plantar f lexion were normal bilaterally. There was slight pronator drift on the left side. Reflexes were 1+ and symmetric through- out. The gait was wide-based and described as \u201ccautious\u201d; the Romberg sign was absent. There was 1+ edema of the lower legs, which was slightly greater on the left side than on the right side. Results of the remainder of the examina- tion \u2014 including tests of cranial-nerve function, sensation to light touch and pinprick, and coor- dination and evaluations of the neck, chest, and abdomen \u2014 were normal and consistent with results obtained during previous gender-affirma- tion procedures.\nThe white-cell, differential, and platelet counts and levels of hemoglobin, magnesium, globulin, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, thyrotropin, and antinuclear antibodies were normal, as were the results of urine and blood toxicology screenings. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Dr. Singh: CT of the head performed without the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial (Fig. 1C and 1D) revealed no new infarction or hemorrhage. Ultrasonography of the lower legs\nwas negative for thrombus.\nDr. Golden: Intravenous normal saline was ad- ministered, and the patient was admitted to this hospital.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mason W. Freeman: This 65-year-old woman with a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and embolic stroke affecting the left side of her body presented with chronic progressive weak- ness and fatigue, along with dysphagia. Her my- algia was associated with worsening weakness of her arm and leg muscles and with a loss of core muscle strength. Several days before the current admission to this hospital, she noticed that her urine was dark, and she had an episode of slurred speech. Physical examination con- firmed the presence of diffuse muscle weakness, but she could still walk with an unsteady gait, was able to lift her arms and legs against grav- ity and some resistance, and had mild dysarthria with no evidence of cranial-nerve deficits, cogni- tive impairment, or sensory loss. Imaging stud- ies showed no evidence of a new stroke or intracranial abnormalities other than the previous infarcts in the territory of the right middle cere- bral artery. Her laboratory findings were all unre- markable except for a markedly increased creatine kinase level of 20,793 U per liter and more mod- est but still substantial elevations of the alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransfer- ase levels. Markers of inflammation, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, were within the normal range, as were results of renal-function tests.\n\nRhabdomyolysis\nThe patient\u2019s muscle weakness and pain com- bined with the presence of dark urine and a clinically significant elevation of the blood cre- atine kinase level are most consistent with a diag- nosis of rhabdomyolysis. Although rhabdomyol- ysis is relatively easy to diagnose, the underlying cause of the muscle breakdown is less straight- forward to identify. Most cases of rhabdomyoly- sis in the United States are caused by trauma (due to crush injury), prolonged immobilization or confinement, or less commonly, postsurgical ischemia.1 The patient\u2019s fall that occurred the week before admission does not appear to have been a clinically significant traumatic episode and would not account for the much longer pro- drome of muscle weakness that is described in her medical history. Extreme muscle activity caused by voluntary protracted exercise or invol- untary stimuli, such as seizures or tetany, is not described. The laboratory findings are not consistent with a major metabolic disturbance that could cause myopathy, such as hypocalcemia, hy- pophosphatemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, or hypothyroidism. The patient\u2019s age and the ap- parent absence of muscle problems before the current illness also make any of the inborn metabolic deficiency syndromes that affect glyco- genolysis, glycolysis, or lipid metabolism unlikely. The paucity of specific symptoms other than muscle weakness and the absence of fever, of an abnormal white-cell count, and of elevated in- flammatory markers (e.g., a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level) make an infectious cause of rhabdomyolysis un- likely.\nThe remaining major causes of rhabdomyolysis include drug- or toxin-induced muscle injury, as well as chronic inflammatory or necrotizing myopathies. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, and serotonin syndromes can be ruled out by the absence of any history of exposure to drugs that produce these condi- tions. Similarly, there is no history suggestive of any recreational drug use, ingestion of heavy metals, or exposure to snake or insect venoms. The patient was receiving one drug that is an un- common cause of rhabdomyolysis, the 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor atorvastatin. Statins can produce rhab- domyolysis through two distinct mechanisms \u2014 one is a direct toxic effect on muscles, and the other is the induction of autoantibodies to the enzyme HMGCR. The direct toxic mechanism ap- pears to be more common than the autoimmune mechanism, occurring in approximately 2 to 5 in every 100,000 statin users. Statin-associated toxic myopathy often occurs when there is a change in the dose of the statin or when another drug that alters the metabolism of the statin, such as a cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitor, is added to the patient\u2019s regimen.2\nStatin-Associated Autoimmune Myopathy Statin-associated autoimmune myopathy typically has an insidious onset and a protracted course.3-5 In patients with statin-associated autoimmune or toxic myopathy, the drug must be stopped to enable recovery; however, patients with the auto- immune syndrome typically do not recover with cessation of the drug alone, whereas patients\nwith the toxic syndrome often do. Thus, if a patient\u2019s condition does not improve substan- tially within 1 or 2 weeks after statin withdrawal, the autoimmune cause must be considered. A key diagnostic test is the detection of autoantibodies that target HMGCR. Statin-associated autoim- mune myopathy can resemble classic inflamma- tory myopathies, including polymyositis, dermato- myositis, and the necrotizing autoimmune myopathies that arise from autoantibodies to the signal recognition particle or to other muscle nucleic-acid or protein targets.6\nBecause the patient had a protracted course of muscle weakness and did not have a change in the statin dose or introduction of a drug that would be likely to produce an important drug\u2013 drug interaction at the time of the onset of muscle-injury symptoms, I favor the diagnosis of autoimmune myopathy rather than a direct toxic effect of the statin. Withdrawal of the statin could be done, followed by a period of watchful waiting. Alternatively, a muscle biopsy could be performed immediately and blood could be tested for the detection of autoantibodies to HMGCR. Since I think a direct toxic effect of the statin is an unlikely diagnosis in this patient and the diagnosis is more likely to be statin-associated autoimmune myopathy or another inflammatory myopathy, I would perform a muscle biopsy, per- haps with MRI guidance to enhance the likeli- hood of selecting an affected area of muscle. Although the patient could have polymyositis or one of the other necrotizing autoimmune myopathies, I suspect that the biopsy specimen would show few signs of inflammation and that a blood test would identify an elevated level of auto- antibodies to HMGCR, confirming the diagnosis of statin-associated autoimmune myopathy.\n\n\n",

We then performed electromyography of muscle groups that were weak in the patient (including biceps and quadriceps, which could be targets for biopsy) to further understand whether myopathy explained the weakness and to delineate the pattern of involvement. At rest, there was abnormal spontaneous activity. With activation, there were short-duration motor-unit potentials with and without reduced amplitude, polyphasia, and early recruitment.",
