    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kelsey Hills-Evans (Medicine): A 39-year-old woman with cyclic vomiting syn- drome and polysubstance use disorder was seen in the emergency department of this hospital because of abdominal pain and vomiting.\nEleven weeks before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a hospital affiliated with this hospital because of intractable nausea and vomiting. She also had loose stools and pain in the right lower abdomen in the presence of menses. Her symptoms were similar to those in previous episodes that had been attributed to cyclic vomiting syndrome. Testing for Clostridium difficile toxin and fecal leukocytes was negative, as was an examination of the stool for ova and parasites; a stool culture showed normal enteric flora. A urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine and opiates. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Mark A. Anderson: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed bi- lateral, punctate, nonobstructing renal calculi without hydronephrosis. There was no evidence of bowel obstruction or acute inflammation in the abdomen or pelvis, including the appendix. Normal premenopausal ovaries that contained functional follicles were noted.\nDr. Hills-Evans: Ondansetron, hydromorphone, and intravenous fluids were ad- ministered. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain resolved. On the second hos- pital day, the patient was able to eat normally and was discharged home.\nOne day before the current presentation, the patient inhaled smoke from an electrical fire in her basement. After the smoke inhalation, pain in the left lower abdomen and severe fatigue developed, but she did not seek medical evaluation. On the day of the current presentation, menses began, and she awoke with nausea and profuse vomiting of dark-brown fluid. Her temperature at home was 39.4\u00b0C. During the next 12 hours, she had persistent nausea and repeated episodes of vomiting. Weakness, light-headedness, and dizziness developed, and she presented to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported ongoing nausea, vomiting, and pain in the left lower abdomen. She reported recent use of cannabinoids but no other drugs. Other medical history included nephrolithiasis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic back pain, depression, gastro- esophageal reflux disease, and severe dysmenor- rhea. Past surgeries included shoulder replace- ment, reduction mammoplasty, and removal of an ovarian cyst. Medications included acetamino- phen, intranasal fluticasone, inhaled fluticasone propionate, albuterol, promethazine, ondansetron, polyethylene glycol, and a multivitamin. She had no known allergies. She did not know of any medical problems in her family. Three years before presentation, she had moved to New En- gland from the northwestern United States after marrying her husband. She had worked in the pharmaceutical industry but had stopped work- ing 3 months previously because of cyclic vomit- ing syndrome. She did not use tobacco or alcohol. She had a history of using cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphet- amine (MDMA).\nThe temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the pulse 165 beats\nper minute, the blood pressure 152/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 52.5 kg; at the affiliated hospital 11 weeks earlier, it had been 59.3 kg. She was alert and oriented but had a labile affect, with alternating periods of laugh- ing and crying. Her gaze was noted to be in- tense, and her speech was rapid, pressured, and at times slurred. She was agitated and was seen thrashing in her bed, pulling at equipment and clothing. Her face and chest were erythematous, and her skin was warm to the touch. A fine tremor was noted in her hands, but no tongue fasciculations were seen. She did not cooperate during a neck examination. The heart sounds were rapid and regular; a systolic ejection mur- mur was noted. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds and no distention; there was tenderness on palpation of the left lower abdomen.\nShortly after arrival in the emergency depart-\nment, the patient vomited \u201ccoffee grounds\u201d material. Twenty-five minutes later, the pulse in- creased from 165 beats per minute to 210 beats per minute.\nDr. Conor D. Barrett: A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained in the emergency department showed supraventricular tachycardia with a long RP interval (Fig. 1A, and Fig. S1 in the Supple- mentary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Adenosine was admin- istered intravenously, and after a ventricular ec- topic beat and a brief episode of atrial ectopy, sinus tachycardia emerged. It is important to note that the last observed event on cessation of this patient\u2019s supraventricular tachycardia was a QRS complex and not a P wave, and the previ- ously observed P wave was of high-to-low atrial activation, as seen in lead II (Fig. 1B). A subse- quent 12-lead electrocardiogram confirmed on- going sinus tachycardia (Fig. 1C).\nDr. Hills-Evans: The alkaline phosphatase level\nwas 165 U per liter (reference range, 27 to 129); the results of other tests of liver function were normal. A urine test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin was negative. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.013, with 2+ ketones and 2+ blood per high-power field, as well as 2 leuko- cytes per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 4). A urine toxicology screen was positive for fen- tanyl, oxycodone, and cannabinoids. The results of other laboratory tests are shown in Table 1. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Anderson: A chest radiograph showed clear lungs, a normal cardiac silhouette, no pulmo- nary edema, and no mediastinal or hilar lymph- adenopathy. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, obtained after the administration of in- travenous contrast material, showed bilateral, punctate, nonobstructing renal calculi without hydronephrosis. During the portal venous phase, the liver attenuation level was 27 Hounsfield units lower than the splenic attenuation level, a finding consistent with hepatic steatosis. There was no bowel obstruction or acute inflammation in the abdomen or pelvis. The appendix ap- peared normal, and the ovaries were premeno- pausal, containing functional follicles (Fig. 2).\nDr. Hills-Evans: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and lorazepam were ad- ministered. The patient was admitted to the in- tensive care unit (ICU), and a diagnostic test was performed.\nFigure 1 (facing page). Electrocardiograms and Rhythm Strip.\nA 12\u2011lead electrocardiogram obtained on the current presentation (Panel A) shows supraventricular tachy\u2011 cardia; the electrocardiogram also showed a long RP interval (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org). A rhythm strip obtained after the administration of adenosine (Panel B) shows termina\u2011 tion of supraventricular tachycardia. After a ventricular ectopic beat and a brief episode of atrial ectopy, sinus tachycardia emerged. A subsequent 12\u2011lead electrocar\u2011 diogram (Panel C) confirms ongoing sinus tachycardia.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Victor Chiappa: This 39-year-old woman with nausea, abdominal pain, and agitation had a sudden episode of tachycardia with a narrow QRS complex, with a heart rate of more than 200 beats per minute. My first step in construct- ing a differential diagnosis is to define the pre- cise type and anatomical origin of the tachycar- dia in order to determine the mechanism of the arrhythmia and hence the underlying disease that is driving this process. In addition, to reach a single unifying diagnosis, I need to consider several other features of this patient\u2019s presenta- tion, including recurrent abdominal pain, pro- found weight loss over an 11-week period, and the development of odd behavior characterized by agitation and pressured speech.\n\nApproach   to    Supraventricular   Tachycardia The patient\u2019s rhythm strip showed rapid tachy- cardia with a narrow QRS complex, a finding consistent with supraventricular tachycardia. The regular rhythm makes atrial fibrillation and multifocal atrial tachycardia unlikely. The abrupt onset makes sinus tachycardia unlikely. In sinus tachycardia, I would expect there to be a ramp-\nup phase, as opposed to an abrupt escalation of the heart rate to more than 200 beats per min- ute. I suspect that this patient\u2019s supraventricular tachycardia with regular rhythm is one of three types: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycar- dia; atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, which is due to retrograde conduction through an ac- cessory pathway; or focal atrial tachycardia.\nDistinguishing among these types requires assessment of the P waves, but at high ventricu- lar rates such as the rate seen in this patient, the P waves can be obscured by, buried within, or superimposed on the T waves or QRS complexes. This patient received adenosine to slow the ven- tricular rate and unmask any P waves in order to allow assessment of their rate, morphologic fea- tures, and position in the cardiac cycle. However, the administration of adenosine also terminated the supraventricular tachycardia, which can hap- pen in patients with atrioventricular nodal re- entrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, and some forms of atrial tachycar- dia. Before it terminated the supraventricular tachycardia, the administration of adenosine resulted in slowing of the ventricular rate and revealed what I suspect are P waves at the end of the T wave, with a long RP interval. Overall, I think atrial tachycardia is the most likely mech- anism of her supraventricular tachycardia.\nRegardless of the specific mechanism, I know that this patient is susceptible to supraventricu- lar tachycardia. What triggered the supraven- tricular tachycardia in this case?\n\nUnderlying Causes of Supraventricular Tachycardia\nIschemia, electrolyte abnormalities, or changes in heart rate, autonomic tone, or the pH of local tissue can lead to premature atrial or ventricular beats, which in turn can trigger supraventricular tachycardia in susceptible patients. Cardiac ische- mia is unlikely in this patient, since she is young and did not have chest pain, ischemic changes on electrocardiography, or elevated troponin levels. Despite her history of cyclic vomiting syndrome and recent nausea and vomiting, the results of laboratory tests did not show clini- cally significant electrolyte or pH abnormalities. An underlying increase in heart rate appears to be the most likely trigger of supraventricular tachycardia in this patient. The initial vital signs were indicative of tachycardia, and after the ad- ministration of adenosine, the supraventricular tachycardia resolved, revealing underlying sinus tachycardia.\n\nUnderlying Causes of Sinus Tachycardia Common drivers of sinus tachycardia to consid- er in this patient include pain, infection, bleed- ing, and hypovolemia. She reported abdominal pain and had tenderness on palpation, but her tachycardia appears to be out of proportion to the reported abdominal pain and to the findings on clinical examination and imaging studies.\nAlthough pain can cause a clinically significant rise in the heart rate, the pain she described would be unlikely to result in this degree of tachycardia.\nTachycardia related to the onset of an infec- tion, such as sepsis and shock due to bowel perforation or bowel ischemia, is unlikely in the absence of hypotension, localizing signs on phys- ical examination, leukocytosis, and persistent fever. Furthermore, chest radiography and CT of the abdomen did not reveal a source of infec- tion, and an intraabdominal process would not explain the other features of her presentation,including agitation, pressured speech, and some- what odd behavior.\nThe normal response to profound hypovole- mia due to bleeding or dehydration is tachycar- dia; the heart rate increases to compensate and to maintain hemodynamic stability. This patient had no history of bleeding and the hematocrit was above the baseline level, so an acute bleed is unlikely to be the driver of her tachycardia. Hypo- volemia due to vomiting and dehydration is pos- sible, but the normal sodium and creatinine levels and only mildly elevated lactate level argue against the presence of hypovolemia severe enough to lead to this degree of tachycardia.\nUp to this point, I have focused on identify-\ning the cause of this patient\u2019s tachycardia. How- ever, to arrive at the correct diagnosis, I need to consider several other features of this case, in- cluding abdominal pain, reported fever, weight loss, and agitation.\n\nNephrolithiasis\nThis patient had a history of nephrolithiasis. Could her presentation be due to the passage of a kidney stone? The pain associated with a kid- ney stone can certainly be severe and, depending on the location of the stone, can sometimes mimic acute abdominal pain. When a stone causes obstruction and hydronephrosis, urosep- sis may develop and vomiting can be a promi- nent presenting feature. Several aspects of this patient\u2019s presentation are suggestive of this di- agnosis. First, she had a known history of neph- rolithiasis, with nonobstructing kidney stones visualized on multiple CT scans. Second, she had 2+ blood in her urine, which could be due to menses but is also consistent with the pas- sage of a kidney stone. However, the imaging studies did not show evidence of urinary ob- struction; there was no hydronephrosis. There- fore, the diagnosis of nephrolithiasis as the cause of her tachycardia and other presenting features is unlikely.\nSubstance Use\nThe patient had a history of using multiple sub- stances, including cocaine, MDMA, opiates, and tetrahydrocannabinol. Her presenting symptoms of tachycardia and agitation could be consistent with intoxication from either cocaine or MDMA, but a toxicology screen did not detect these sub- stances. Withdrawal from opiates could explain\n \ntachycardia, agitation, nausea, vomiting, and ab- dominal pain. However, she did not have dia- phoresis, yawning, goose bumps, or dilated pu- pils, findings consistent with opiate withdrawal. The toxicology screen was positive for fentanyl and cannabinoids, either of which could have been laced with an unknown substance that could not be detected by means of current toxi- cologic testing methods. Although I cannot rule out the possibility that intoxication or with- drawal led to tachycardia, I want to avoid an- choring on her history of substance use disorder in order to avoid premature narrowing of the differential diagnosis.\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\nSerotonin syndrome is an important consider- ation in this patient, since she reportedly had a fever while at home and had a tremor and agita- tion. Opiates, ondansetron, MDMA, and cocaine have all been implicated in this syndrome.1 How- ever, even if I assume that she had taken a sero- tonergic agent, according to the Hunter criteria (a decision rule developed to assist in the diag- nosis of serotonin syndrome), the absence of hyperreflexia and of clonus rules out serotonin syndrome.2\n\nOvarian Teratoma\nAlthough the patient was alert and oriented, her speech was rapid and pressured and her affect was labile. Also, she had lost approximately 7 kg of body weight since the initial hospital admis- sion, which took place 11 weeks before her cur- rent presentation. The combination of weight loss, abdominal pain, and behavioral change in a 39-year-old woman arouses concerns about cancer, possibly an ovarian teratoma causing limbic encephalitis. However, this diagnosis would not explain the tachycardia, and although the patient had a known history of cystic disease of the ovaries, the presence of a teratoma or another mass lesion of the ovaries was ruled out on imaging studies.\n\nHyperthyroidism\nThe combination of tachycardia3,4 and weight loss,5 the two most prominent features of this patient\u2019s presentation, suggests hyperthyroid- ism. When I consider the weight loss and tachy- cardia in the context of agitation, vomiting,6 and neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms7 \u2014 such as a labile affect, intense gaze, pressured speech, fine tremor, and skin erythema and warmth \u2014 the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism rises to the top of my differential diagnosis. Furthermore, supra- ventricular tachycardia triggered by underlying tachycardia3,4 occurring in the context of thyro- toxicosis would provide a single unifying diag- nosis in this case. In geographic regions in which patients typically have sufficient iodine intake, hyperthyroidism is most commonly due to either Graves\u2019 disease or nodular thyroid dis- ease. To establish the diagnosis, I would per- form thyroid-function tests as well as antibody tests for autoimmune thyroid disease. If these tests are not diagnostic of Graves\u2019 disease, ad- ditional studies to look for other, less likely causes of hyperthyroidism may be needed.\n\n\n",
