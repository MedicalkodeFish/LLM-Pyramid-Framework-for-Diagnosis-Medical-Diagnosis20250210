    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Matthew L. Meizlish (Medicine): A 57-year-old woman with resected stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma was admitted to this hospital because of fever.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 months before the current admission, when bleeding developed from a lesion on the right side of the scalp. After evaluation by her primary care physician, she was referred to a surgical clinic at an- other hospital; examination of a skin-biopsy specimen revealed ulcerated melanoma with positive margins. The patient was referred to the oncology clinic of this hospital. Three months before the current admission, a wide local excision of the scalp lesion and a neck lymph-node dissection were performed; examination of the specimens revealed metastatic melanoma in 2 of 26 lymph nodes. A diagnosis of stage IIIC melanoma was made. Molecular profiling identified the BRAF V600E mutation, and treatment with adjuvant therapy was planned to begin after the pa-\ntient had recovered fully from surgery.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was evaluated in the on- cology clinic for initiation of treatment with a combination of dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) as targeted therapy for melanoma. She felt well, and the surgical wound had healed. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was started.\nOne day after the initiation of treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib, fever and nausea developed. Dabrafenib and trametinib therapy was temporarily discontin- ued, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was resumed.\nTwo weeks before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was evalu- ated at the other hospital. The blood levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were nor- mal, as were the complete blood count and the results of tests of kidney function. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was started. Fever and nausea resolved after 1 day, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was stopped. Once the patient had 1 day without recurrent fever after the antipyretic medications had been stopped, treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again resumed.\nFour days before the current admission, fever recurred. The patient was again evaluated at the other hospital. Results of liver tests and kidney- function tests were again normal, as was the com- plete blood count. Treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib was again stopped, and treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen was initiated. Daily fevers persisted for 4 days, and the patient was advised to present to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported fatigue that had started 1 month earlier and had gradually increased in severity, as well as light-headedness when standing from a seated position. She also reported intermittent vomiting, loose stools, and pain in the right upper quadrant that increased after eating but no diarrhea or dysuria. She had a dry cough without shortness of breath.\nOther medical history included carpal tunnel syndrome that had been treated with carpal tunnel release surgery. The patient had no known drug allergies. She worked as a nurse and lived with her husband and two adult children in a coastal region of New England. She did not drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or use illicit drugs. Her father had hy- perthyroidism; her mother had hypertension, dia- betes mellitus, and cerebrovascular disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 40.2\u00b0C, the blood pressure 85/53 mm Hg, the pulse 108 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was diaphoretic and appeared ill. The mucous mem- branes were moist, and no lesions were present in the oropharynx. The heart sounds were regular, with no murmurs, and the lungs were clear on auscultation. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rash was present.\nThe white-cell count was 5190 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000); 20% of the cells were bands (reference range, 0 to 10), and 10% were metamyelocytes (reference value, 0). The platelet count was 87,000 per microliter (refer- ence range, 150,000 to 400,000). The blood level of creatinine was 2.73 mg per deciliter (241 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.60 to 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), AST 190 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 32), ALT 62 U per liter (reference range, 7 to 33), and alkaline phos- phatase 173 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100). Tests of a nasopharyngeal swab for adeno- virus, human rhinovirus and enterovirus, influ- enza virus types A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1 through 4, respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were negative. A blood specimen was obtained for culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Jiyoon Kang: Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant (Fig. 1A and 1B) revealed chole- lithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis or bili- ary ductal dilatation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1C through 1F), performed without the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, revealed findings suggestive of hepatic steatosis, pulmo- nary edema, small bilateral pleural effusions, subsegmental linear atelectasis, and bilateral lung nodules that were similar in appearance to those seen on staging CT performed 1 month earlier.\nDr. Meizlish: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the blood pressure improved; empiri- cal treatment with vancomycin, cefepime, met- ronidazole, and azithromycin was initiated. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn hospital day 2, fever and nausea resolved. There was no vomiting or loose stools. However, pain in the right upper quadrant had worsened. On hospital day 3, blood cultures were without growth, and treatment with vancomycin, cef- epime, metronidazole, and azithromycin was discontinued. The patient remained afebrile. On hospital day 5, the blood level of AST was 407 U per liter, ALT 138 U per liter, and alkaline phos- phatase 510 U per liter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1.

The common bile duct is normal in caliber, measuring 3 mm. A CT image of the abdomen and pelvis (Panel C), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, shows diffuse hypoattenuation of the liver, with a mean attenuation level of 36 Hounsfield units (HU) (as compared with the spleen, which has an attenuation level of 46 HU), a finding that suggests hepatic steatosis (white circle on left side). CT images of the chest (Panels D, E, and F), obtained without the administration of intravenous contrast material, show smooth interlobular septal thickening both at the apex and at the lung bases (arrows), small bilateral pleural effusions (asterisks), and bronchial wall thickening (arrowheads), findings that suggest pulmonary edema.\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Amir M. Mohareb: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagno- sis. The patient had recently begun adjuvant therapy with combination BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitors for resected stage IIIC melanoma. Her early treatment course was complicated by two epi- sodes of fever that rapidly resolved after brief discontinuation of treatment with BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitors. The current admission is character- ized by an acute illness with high fevers that persisted for 4 days after discontinuation of treatment with BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitors. She also had hypotension, acute kidney injury, and acute liver injury.\nIn this case, defining a clinical syndrome and developing a differential diagnosis is challeng- ing because the patient presented with numer- ous abnormalities involving multiple organ sys- tems. The challenge is in selecting the clinical problems that are most pertinent to the cause of the underlying disease, rather than abnormali- ties that are consequences of the underlying dis- ease or are incidental findings. If the clinical problem that is selected is too nonspecific (e.g., fatigue), the differential diagnosis becomes un- manageable. On the other hand, if the syndrome selected is too specific, there is a risk of focusing too narrowly and missing the underlying disease. For this patient, I will focus on the clinical syn- drome of fever.\nIn many patients who present with fever, an\ninfectious cause can be rapidly identified on the basis of a set of localizing symptoms and find- ings on diagnostic testing (e.g., the presence of cough and lung opacities). In addition, an organ- ism may be quickly identified by means of mi- crobiologic testing, completing the diagnostic evaluation. However, in this patient, no diagnos- tic imaging findings or microbiologic studies pointed to a specific infectious cause of fever. Therefore, I will approach her case systematically by considering the time course of the fevers, the host immune system, the environment and ex- posures, and key diagnostic findings.\n\nTime Course of Fevers\nWhen evaluating the time course of fevers, I consider the severity (i.e., maximum tempera- ture), duration, and pace of illness. In this pa- tient, fever developed 4 weeks before the current admission and 1 day after starting BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitors for the treatment of melanoma.1 These therapies are known to cause treatment-related pyrexia.2,3 This patient had three discrete febrile episodes after beginning treatment with BRAF\u2013 MEK inhibitors, the last of which persisted and progressed despite the discontinuation of these therapies. A key question was whether the third febrile episode leading to hospitalization was part of a syndrome that had lasted for 4 weeks and was consistent with treatment-related pyrexia from BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitor therapy or whether it was an acute illness that was separate from the previous episodes. When the patient initially presented to the emergency department, she was febrile, hypotensive, and generally appeared ill; she was treated for a presumed severe bacterial infection (for which fluid resuscitation and broad- spectrum antibiotic therapy were administered), since that was the most life-threatening possi- bility.\n\nHost Immune System\nWhen assessing the host immune system, I evalu- ate for acquired and inherited causes of immuno- suppression, including immunosuppressive medi- cations, viral infections, and liver and kidney disease, all of which have systemic effects that may alter the immune system. I also consider lo- cal immunologic changes related to anatomical alterations, previous surgeries, previous radio- therapy, and the presence of implanted hardware or prostheses. This patient had not been treated with immunosuppressive chemotherapy; however, she was receiving immunomodulating therapy for melanoma, and these agents can alter the host\u2013pathogen immune response and cause aber- rant tissue inflammation.\n\nEnvironment and Exposures\nWhen considering the patient\u2019s environment and epidemiologic risk factors, I rely heavily on his- tory taking. I inquire about habitation, occupa- tion, travel, food and diet, medication use, sexual exposures, and proximity to animal and environ- mental vectors. I also consider possible commu- nity-acquired exposures and remain vigilant for current outbreaks and epidemics in the commu- nity, for which public health authorities provide an excellent resource.4 This patient is a nurse, which puts her at risk for health care exposures, including needlestick injuries and respiratory in- fections such as tuberculosis. She lives in a coastal region of New England, which puts her at risk for tickborne and mosquito-borne diseases in the appropriate season.\n\nKey Diagnostic Findings\nWhat other key examination and diagnostic find- ings can help refine the clinical syndrome of fever in this patient? She initially presented with abdominal tenderness, liver injury, thrombocy- topenia, abnormal coagulation test results, acute kidney injury, and an elevated creatine kinase level. Several of these abnormalities did not abate after the administration of f luid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. She had\n \n\nworsening tenderness in the right upper quad- rant, leukopenia, and progressive elevation in the levels of ALT, AST, and bilirubin. Therefore, the differential diagnosis must include conditions that would explain the patient\u2019s acute liver injury in the context of 4 weeks of intermittent fever, with prioritization of diseases that may also cause leukopenia.\n\nAcute Liver Injury, Fevers, and Leukopenia\nLife-threatening causes of acute liver injury and fevers \u2014 such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, ap- pendicitis, liver abscess, and perihepatitis (the Fitz-Hugh\u2013Curtis syndrome) \u2014 were ruled out at the time of admission, given the relatively nor- mal findings on ultrasonography and CT. Liver injury, fever, and leukopenia can accompany acute viral infections, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, Ep- stein\u2013Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus, as well as viral hepatitis, among others. Many of these in- fections can be ruled out by serologic or nucleic acid testing. Vectorborne infections can also produce a syndrome of fever, leukopenia, and elevated levels of ALT and AST, including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, rickettsial disease, West Nile virus infection, and Powassan virus infection, all of which are caused by organ- isms that are present in New England. This pa- tient lacked the requisite travel or exposure his- tory for other types of arboviral infections, such as those caused by Zika virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus.\nIt is important to consider the duration of fever. Fevers that persist for several weeks sug- gest the possibility of subacute infective endo- carditis, which can be associated with embolic disease and immune activation and should be evaluated with several sets of blood cultures before the administration of antibiotic agents, as was done in this case. Chronic fever with liver injury can also be associated with infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, nontuber- culous mycobacterial infection, brucellosis, and endemic mycoses. Most of these infections can also cause leukopenia, either through bone mar- row suppression or through direct bone marrow infiltration. This patient\u2019s occupation as a health care worker puts her at risk for tuberculosis, al- though she reported that previous latent tuber- culosis testing was negative.\nNoninfectious causes of liver injury that may occasionally also cause fever include drug-induced liver injury, sarcoidosis, the Budd\u2013Chiari syn- drome, and some autoimmune diseases. Among all possible diagnoses, drug-induced liver injury was the most important consideration in this patient, given the mixed cholestatic and hepato- cellular pattern of liver injury. The patient did not report recreational drug or herbal medicine use, so the most likely culprits were the BRAF\u2013 MEK inhibitors dabrafenib and trametinib.\nFurther investigative testing that was recommended at this point included examination of a peripheral-blood smear and serologic and nucle- ic acid testing for acute viral infections, vector-borne infections, and atypical infections, such as those noted above. Although drug-induced liver injury was considered to be the most likely diag- nosis in this patient, a liver biopsy was performed on hospital day 5, given continued diagnostic uncertainty and the presence of increasing levels of ALT and AST.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Stuti G. Shroff: Examination of a core-biopsy specimen of the liver (Fig. 2) revealed regenera- tive hepatic parenchyma with numerous well- formed, nonnecrotizing epithelioid granulomas involving the portal tracts and lobules. Associated patchy mixed inflammation that was predomi- nantly mononuclear, with plasma cells, occa- sional neutrophils, and rare eosinophils, was also present. No histologically significant biliary epi- thelial injury was seen. The lobular parenchyma was punctuated by numerous apoptotic hepato- cytes. Staining of the biopsy specimen for acid- fast bacilli was negative, and Grocott\u2013Gomori methenamine silver staining and periodic acid\u2013 Schiff staining showed no fungal organisms. Immunohistochemical staining was negative for cytomegalovirus inclusion bodies and herpes simplex virus. In situ hybridization for Epstein\u2013 Barr virus\u2013encoded RNA was also negative. A spirochete immunostain was negative, and no bacteria were identified on Gram\u2019s staining of the liver tissue.\nThe differential diagnosis for well-formed epithelioid granulomas involving the liver paren- chyma is broad and encompasses infectious and noninfectious processes. In this patient, several infections were ruled out on histologic examina- tion. Given the absence of evidence supporting an alternative diagnosis such as infection or sar- coidosis, the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s syndrome is drug-induced liver injury resulting from BRAF\u2013MEK inhibitor therapy (dabrafenib and trametinib).\n",
