    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. James W. Luccarelli (Psychiatry): A 70-year-old man with bipolar disorder was evaluated at this hospital because of depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and gait disturbance.\nThe patient had a long history of depressive episodes, with two previous hospi- talizations for suicide attempts. Approximately two decades before the current admission, he was struck on the head with a beam while working at a construction site and had a 4-cm laceration. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital, where the wound was sutured but no further evaluation was conducted. Approximately 10 years before the current admission, around the time of his mother\u2019s death, the patient was evaluated at this hospital because of an episode of irritability, a reduced need for sleep, and grandiosity; he reported feelings of \u201ctran- scendence\u201d and being \u201cat one with God.\u201d He was admitted for 1 month to the psychiatry unit of a second hospital, where he was treated with lithium and elec- troconvulsive therapy. Thereafter, he received outpatient psychiatric treatment on\na monthly basis, as well as therapy with valproic acid and fluoxetine.\nApproximately 9 years before the current admission, the patient fell on concrete stairs and had back pain with subsequent lower-leg weakness and urinary incon- tinence. He was evaluated at a third hospital, where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine revealed multilevel degenerative changes, including L4\u2013L5 spinal stenosis and central disk protrusion. Acetaminophen and physical therapy were prescribed.\nFive years later (4 years before the current admission), the patient fell because of an unsteady gait and was evaluated at a fourth hospital. Neurologic examination revealed a memory deficit (with an inability to recall any objects after 5 minutes on the three-item object-recall test) and poor attention (with an inability to per- form serial sevens calculations), as well as action tremor in the arms and \u201cmildly unsteady\u201d gait, even with the use of a cane. The remainder of the physical examination was re- portedly normal. The complete blood count, results of renal function tests, and levels of electrolytes, valproic acid, folate, vitamin B12, glycated hemo- globin, and thyrotropin were normal; serum and urine toxicologic panels were negative. MRI of the head reportedly revealed no evidence of an infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or a mass but showed mild prominence of ventricles, sulci, and cisterns. The dose of fluoxetine was decreased, and the patient was discharged 3 days later.\nAdditional falls occurred 2 months and 4 months later, and both times, the patient was evaluated at the fourth hospital. Two months after the most recent fall, he hit the car in front of him while driving. His psychiatrist noted that he had bilateral tremor at rest; the dose of val- proic acid was reduced, and he was referred to a neurologist. Two months after the car crash, he fell while walking and was evaluated at the fourth hospital. The evaluation was notable for nystagmus and a normal valproic acid level (89 \u03bcg per milliliter; reference range, 50 to 100) despite the dose reduction; the doses of valproic acid and trazodone were reduced, and physical therapy was provided. During the next 5 months, gait instability was reduced but persisted. The patient was evaluated by two other neurologists after reporting a feeling of \u201cimbalance.\u201d Audiometry revealed mild-to-moderate high-frequency sensori- neural hearing loss. Medications were considered to be a contributor to his balance dysfunction.\nDuring the next 12 months, the dose of val-\nproic acid was tapered and fluoxetine was stopped; the patient underwent trials of escitalopram and then sertraline for the treatment of depressive symptoms. He reported to his psychiatrist symp- toms of confusion, some difficulty with mem- ory, and decreased leg coordination. The Mon- treal Cognitive Assessment score was 23 (scores range from 0 to 30, with a score of 18 to 25 suggesting mild cognitive impairment).\nDr. McKinley Glover: Fifteen months before the current admission, the patient began to have dizziness. MRI of the head (Fig. 1), performed at this hospital, revealed an old infarct in the left corona radiata, features of mild small-vessel disease, mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss, and mild ventricular prominence.\nDr. Luccarelli: Neuropsychiatric testing was per- formed, and the results did not suggest a neurodegenerative process. Given the patient\u2019s progres- sively depressed mood, treatment with aripiprazole was started, with the dose adjusted over the following 12 months.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient reported worsening depression, with hopelessness, guilt, and increased sleep. That month, his son found him unable to walk and requiring assistance to move. On examination, he had tremor and muscle rigidity; on ambula- tion, he had a shuffling gait and required a cane. Treatment with aripiprazole was stopped, benztropine was started, and sertraline was re- placed by fluoxetine.\nOne month before the current admission, the patient was voluntarily hospitalized in the psy- chiatry unit of this hospital because of worsen- ing depression, which he attributed to the pro- gressive reduction in mobility and strength. He reported 3 weeks of frequent early morning awakenings, anhedonia, low energy, anorexia, difficulty concentrating, and low motivation, such that he had not paid bills or bathed. Exami- nation was notable for tremor, muscle rigidity, and a shuffling gait. Blood levels of folate, vita- min B12, and glycated hemoglobin were normal.\nOther laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nTests for human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 antibodies and type 1 antigen and for antitreponemal antibodies were negative. Over the 5-day hospitalization, the dose of fluoxetine was increased and treatment with lurasidone was started.\nDuring the following 4 weeks, the patient\u2019s ability to walk continued to deteriorate, and he required intermittent use of a walker and a wheelchair. His depressive symptoms persisted, and after he reported thoughts of suicide and feeling unsafe to his psychiatrist, he was volun- tarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit of this hospital. A review of systems was notable for malaise, anorexia, poor sleep, anhedonia, hopelessness, guilt, low energy, worsening gait, and chronic joint pain; he reported no recent falls or manic symptoms.\nThe patient\u2019s psychiatric history included bipolar depression with suicide attempts and mul- tiple psychiatric admissions, obsessive\u2013compul- sive disorder, and skin picking. His medical history was notable for long-standing urinary incontinence, hypertension, and sleep apnea; he had undergone laser ablation of the prostate 4 years earlier, as well as bilateral inguinal her- nia repair and rotator cuff repair. Medications at the time of admission included fluoxetine, lurasi- done, valproic acid, aspirin, and lisinopril, as well as lorazepam and trazodone as needed. Lithium had caused tremor, aripiprazole had caused mus- cle rigidity and tremor, and gabapentin had caused grogginess. The patient did not smoke tobacco, and he drank alcohol less than once monthly; he had previously smoked marijuana several times daily but had been abstinent for 2 years. He was retired from employment as a laborer. He was divorced and resided in an assisted-living facility. His family history was notable for major depression in his mother and bipolar disorder in one of his children.\nThe temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 74 beats per minute, the blood pressure 110/61 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 28.5. The patient was wheelchair-bound. He was described as well-groomed and cooperative, with appropri- ate eye contact. He was oriented to time, place, and person. His speech was fluent and indicated a logical thought process but was considered to be \u201cslow.\u201d Some of his responses seemed slow, but naming, repetition, attention, concentration, and memory were intact. His mood and affect were described as depressed, and he had suicidal ideation. Results of cranial nerve examination were normal, except for reduced facial expres- sion. Motor examination showed mildly increased tone in the lower legs and left arm, with brady- kinesia, and was otherwise normal. The gait was described as being \u201cslow to start\u201d with a \u201cmag- netic quality\u201d and then as \u201cshuffling\u201d for a few steps. The remainder of the neurologic and gen- eral physical examinations was normal.\nThe white-cell count, platelet count, and levels\nof hemoglobin, calcium, and albumin were nor- mal, as were results of liver-function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Glover: MRI of the head (Fig. 2), performed with and without the administration of contrast material, revealed the old infarct in the left co- rona radiata, features of mild small-vessel dis- ease, and mild diffuse brain parenchymal volume loss with prominence of the ventricles and syl- vian fissures. There was no abnormal enhance- ment. Coronal reformatted images showed a callosal angle (the angle at which the two lateral ventricles meet at the level of the posterior com- missure) of 66 degrees.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Feyza Marouf: This 70-year-old man with a his- tory of bipolar disorder presented to this hospi- tal for a second time for treatment of refractory major depression, fluctuations in cognitive per- formance, and a marked decline in motor func- tion characterized by progressive gait distur- bance. Despite multiple evaluations by specialists in neurology and psychiatry, he presented to the inpatient psychiatry unit in a wheelchair-bound state only 4 years after he started to have falls, without a clear explanation for his physical im- pairment. The first step in constructing a differ- ential diagnosis in this case is to determine whether his problems can be attributed primar- ily to a psychiatric illness or whether the depres- sive episode is due to an underlying illness.\n\nLate-Life Depression\nThe differential diagnosis of late-life depression can be complex, particularly in patients with multiple medical problems, cognitive symptoms, and difficulty coping with physical and func- tional impairment. Consideration of both pri- mary and secondary causes of depression is essen- tial in clarifying the diagnosis. Primary mood disorders that cause depression in older adults include major and minor unipolar depression, as well as bipolar spectrum disorders. Depression can also be a feature of other psychiatric ill- nesses, including adjustment disorders, bereave- ment, chronic psychotic disorders, and substance use disorders.1\nThis patient had a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. His history included recurrent depressive episodes beginning early in life and one late- onset manic episode occurring at 60 years of age. Late presentations of mania often suggest an underlying medical cause, but none was identi- fied in this case. On admission, the patient\u2019s symptoms met the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode. Depression in late life can also reflect minor depression, in which a patient does not meet the full criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), for a depressive episode but still has substantial impairment from the symp- toms. As compared with early presentations of depression, late presentations are associated with a high incidence of coexisting medical condi- tions, prominent cognitive deficits, a chronic course, and a poor response to treatment.\nCould this patient\u2019s depressive symptoms stem from an underlying process? His cognitive dif- ficulties and motor symptoms remain unexplained. Common medical causes of late-life depression include dementia, cancer, stroke, myocardial in- farction, hypothyroidism, and Parkinson\u2019s dis- ease. The patient\u2019s medical workup had been reassuring on most counts, but there is a possi- bility that dementia, a movement disorder, or cerebrovascular injury has a role in his depres- sive presentation, so these conditions warrant closer scrutiny.\n \n\nDementia\nLate-life depression is often confused with de- mentia. Depression can precede dementia and can be a risk factor for its development. When cognitive deficits result from depression, they are usually characterized by rapid symptom progres- sion with poor effort during cognitive testing and a lack of awareness of impairment. Prompt- ing often helps with information recall. When cognitive changes are long-standing and persist after depression is successfully treated, underly- ing dementia is more likely to be the diagnosis. This patient\u2019s cognitive history shows a pat- tern of f luctuating impairment over the past several years. His cognitive difficulties seem to extend beyond his recent mood deterioration, rather than occurring concurrently with it. On admission, cognitive testing revealed pronounced slowing rather than confusion. Recent neuropsy- chiatric testing had revealed no evidence of a neurodegenerative process, so Alzheimer\u2019s dis- ease and Parkinson\u2019s disease are unlikely. The absence of a classic resting tremor and of am- nestic deficits also makes these diagnoses un- likely. The patient had no history of visual hal- lucinations suggestive of Lewy body dementia or of changes in behavior consistent with fronto- temporal dementia. MRI of the head revealed evidence of small-vessel disease, including a left lacunar infarct. Microvascular changes are fre- quently associated with late-life depression and\ncan contribute to a refractory course of illness.\n\nReversible Causes of Cognitive Impairment\nIn addition to dementia, reversible causes of cognitive impairment need to be considered. Reversible causes include medication side effects, thyroid abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, vitamin deficiencies, infection (e.g., neurosyphi- lis), sleep apnea, and normal pressure hydro- cephalus.2 This patient\u2019s cognition did not im- prove after adjustments to his psychotropic medication regimen, and an extensive laboratory evaluation did not suggest a metabolic abnor- mality. However, on three occasions, MRI of the head revealed mild prominence of the ventricles, a finding consistent with temporal progression of the cognitive symptoms. The subtle MRI find- ings of an acute callosal angle of 66 degrees and an Evans index (a marker of ventricular enlargement calculated as the ratio of the maximum width of the frontal horns of the lateral ventri- cles to the maximum internal diameter of the skull) of 0.39 support the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus.\n\nNormal Pressure Hydrocephalus\nThe classic triad of gait instability, cognitive impairment, and urinary incontinence distin- guishes normal pressure hydrocephalus from other disorders. This patient had the character- istic features of gait impairment due to normal pressure hydrocephalus, including the feeling of his feet being \u201cglued to the floor,\u201d with difficul- ties in motor planning, especially turning, result- ing in frequent falls. Unlike Parkinson\u2019s disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus is not expected to cause a resting tremor. Postural instability and falls occur more frequently in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus than in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, especially early in the disease course.\nCognitive features of normal pressure hydro-\ncephalus include generalized slowing, which is usually more prominent than deficits in attention, concentration, or memory. Executive-function deficits and apathy are also common and fit with this patient\u2019s history and clinical presenta- tion. Urinary symptoms often develop during the late stage of illness, with urinary urgency occurring more frequently than urinary inconti- nence. Apathy that manifests as a lack of moti- vation is commonly identified as a psychiatric difficulty in patients with normal pressure hydro- cephalus. The development of apathy can cause normal pressure hydrocephalus to mimic a de- pressive illness and thus can delay the diagnosis. Given the patient\u2019s long-standing bipolar dis- order, it is likely that most of his current mood symptoms are due to underlying bipolar disorder rather than to normal pressure hydrocephalus. However, alleviation of the motor and cognitive symptoms with the treatment of normal pres- sure hydrocephalus would be expected to im- prove his mood. Successful treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus has also been associated with alleviation and even remission of psychiat-\nric symptoms.3-7\nThe next step in clarifying the diagnosis in this patient would be to perform a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. A large-volume lumbar puncture should alleviate or reverse the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus, including any associated mood or cognitive symptoms.\n\n\n",
