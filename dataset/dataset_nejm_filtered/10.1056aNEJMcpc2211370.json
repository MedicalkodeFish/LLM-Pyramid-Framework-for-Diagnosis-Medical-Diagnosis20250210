    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Florence H. Porterfield (Medicine): A 71-year-old woman was admitted to this hos- pital because of refractory hemolytic anemia.\nThe patient, who had recurrent breast cancer and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, had been in her usual state of health until 7 months before the current admission, when fatigue and dyspnea on exertion developed. She was reportedly evaluated by a cardiologist and a pulmonologist, but no cause for her symptoms was identified.\nTwo months before the current admission, dyspnea on exertion worsened, pal- pitations and dizziness developed, and the patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, a low blood level of haptoglo- bin, and an elevated blood level of lactate dehydrogenase. The blood levels of electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function tests; other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A peripheral-blood smear showed schisto- cytes. A direct antiglobulin test was negative, complement levels were reportedly low, and a low titer of cold agglutinins was present. Testing for antibodies against \u03b22-glycoprotein I and cardiolipin was negative, as was a screening test for lupus\nanticoagulant. Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and other common respiratory viruses was negative. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood revealed no aberrant clonal population of cells and no evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, showed bilateral mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy that was unchanged from that observed on imaging performed 2 years earlier. Packed red cells were transfused, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. Treatment with glucocorticoids was initiated for a working diagnosis of Coombs\u2019-negative autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\nOn the third hospital day, anemia persisted, and additional units of packed red cells were transfused. The blood pressure had increased from 118/62 mm Hg on admission to 150/60 mm Hg. Treatment with glucocorticoids was stopped, and treatment with captopril was initiated for a work- ing diagnosis of scleroderma renal crisis. Blood testing for the level of ADAMTS13 activity was performed, and on the sixth hospital day, treat- ment with plasmapheresis was started for the possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocyto- penic purpura (TTP). The patient underwent a total of six sessions of plasmapheresis during the first 2 weeks of the hospitalization.\n \nDuring the second week of the hospitaliza- tion, treatment with eculizumab was initiated. The patient received packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days for ongoing hemolytic ane- mia. The results of the blood test for activity of ADAMTS13 returned; the activity level was 65% (reference value, >67%), and treatment with plasmapheresis was stopped.\nDuring the third week of the hospitalization, treatment with eculizumab was continued, and treatment with rituximab was initiated; however, the patient still received packed red-cell transfu- sions every 2 or 3 days. During the fourth week of the hospitalization, weekly treatment with both eculizumab and rituximab was continued, and a 3-day course of intravenous immune globulin was administered. Despite this treat- ment, there was no reduction in hemolysis.\nDuring the fifth week of the hospitalization, the patient continued to receive packed red-cell transfusions every 2 or 3 days, and thrombocy- topenia developed. Treatment with glucocorti- coids was resumed, and treatment with twice- weekly injections of epoetin alfa was initiated. A biopsy specimen of the bone marrow reportedly showed hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and erythroid predomi- nance.\nDuring the sixth week of the hospitalization, the need for red-cell transfusion persisted, treat- ment with cyclophosphamide was initiated, and the dose of captopril was increased. During the seventh week of the hospitalization, acute kid- ney injury (AKI) developed, and treatment with captopril and glucocorticoids was stopped. On the 50th hospital day, the patient was trans- ferred to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn evaluation at this hospital, the patient reported nausea, poor appetite, and weight loss of 9 kg during the past 2 months. She also re- ported that her urine had appeared pink or cola-colored after each transfusion of packed red cells.\nTwenty-one years earlier, localized clinical stage T1cpN1aM0 (according to the tumor\u2013 node\u2013metastasis classification system), estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\u2013negative invasive lobular breast cancer of the left breast was diagnosed. She had been treated initially with lumpectomy, radia- tion, and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as with tamoxifen for 5 years and letrozole for 2 years. Three years before the current admission, there was a locoregional recurrence of ER-positive breast cancer in her left axilla; a lymph-node biopsy was negative. Staging studies reportedly revealed mildly prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and several indeterminate hepatic and renal lesions. Biopsy of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes was reportedly negative. The patient declined recommended chemotherapeu-\n \n\ntic treatment options for recurrent breast cancer and instead opted for surveillance imaging. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging, ultra- sonography, and mammography of the breasts, which had been performed 6 months before the current admission, were reportedly unchanged from previous imaging. She had not palpated any new breast lumps on self-examination.\nThree years before the current admission, systemic sclerosis associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase III was diagnosed. Sclerosis was limited to the skin, and the patient had not received any specific treatment. Other medical history included Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, latent tubercu- losis that had been diagnosed 30 years earlier and treated with isoniazid for 9 months, dyslip- idemia, and osteoporosis. Medications included exemestane, goserelin, calcium, cholecalciferol, pantoprazole, and rosuvastatin. The patient took no over-the-counter remedies or supplements. She was allergic to trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxa- zole, which had caused fever and hives. She drank alcohol rarely and did not use any other substances. She had smoked tobacco for 3 years but had quit 50 years before the current admis- sion. The patient was married and lived with her husband in New England. She was retired from work in health care. Three of her sisters had had breast cancer in their seventh decades of life; there was no family history of hemolysis.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.3\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 162/98 mm Hg, the pulse 105 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 17. The patient was alert and oriented. There was jaun- dice and scleral icterus. She had a well-healed lumpectomy scar on the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There was no cervical, supracla- vicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Mild skin thickening was present on the hands and feet, with subtly reduced skin mobility of the fore- arms and legs. The remainder of the examina- tion was normal.\nThe blood level of creatinine was 2.87 mg per deciliter (254 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range,\n0.60\tto 1.50 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and the blood urea nitrogen level was 62 mg per deciliter (22 mmol per liter; reference range,8 to 25 mg per deciliter [3 to 9 mmol per liter]). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed 3+ blood and 2+ protein, without bilirubin, urobilinogen, glucose, ketones, leukocyte esterase, or nitrates; the specific grav- ity and pH were normal. Microscopic examina- tion of the urinary sediment revealed 10 to 20 red cells per high-power field (reference range, 0 to 2) and 3 to 5 white cells per high-power field (ref- erence value, <10), and there were muddy-brown casts without dysmorphic red cells. The total protein:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample was 6.41 (reference value, <0.15). A peripheral- blood smear was obtained.Dr. Robert Ta: The peripheral-blood smear\n(Fig. 1) showed anisopoikilocytosis, 10 to 15 schistocytes per high-power field, teardrop cells, nucleated red cells, reticulocytes, and mature and left-shifted myeloid cells. Dr. Porterfield: Additional imaging studies were obtained, and a diagnostic test was performed.\n\nFigure 1. Peripheral-Blood Specimens on Admission to This Hospital.\nWright\u2013Giemsa staining shows anisopoikilocytosis and schistocytes (Panel A, arrows); in other areas, teardrop cells are present (Panel B, arrows). Immature myeloid precursors (Panel C, arrow) and nucleated red cells (Panel C, arrowheads) can also be seen.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura;Hemolytic\u2013Uremic   Syndrome;Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation ;Malignant Hypertension;Drug-Induced TMA;Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome ;Scleroderma Renal Crisis;Cancer-Associated TMA",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Alfred I. Lee: This 71-year-old woman with breast cancer and systemic sclerosis had several months of progressive fatigue and dyspnea and was found to have microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). MAHA is a subtype of intravas- cular hemolysis that is characterized by red-cell fragmentation due to direct trauma; the identifi- cation of two or more schistocytes on multiple blood-smear fields at high magnification sug- gests a diagnosis of MAHA.\nThrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is charac- terized by MAHA and thrombocytopenia, where- by endothelial activation and thrombosis lead to microvascular occlusion, shearing of red cells, and platelet consumption, although a small per- centage of patients with TMA may have a normal platelet count on initial presentation.1 This pa- tient initially had hemolytic anemia, and schisto- cytes were observed on a peripheral-blood smear; then, during the fifth week of hospitalization at the other hospital, thrombocytopenia developed. Taken together, these features are consistent with a diagnosis of TMA. Numerous conditions can give rise to TMA through one of three prin- cipal mechanisms: primary or secondary hemo- static derangements or endothelial injury. Deter- mining the underlying cause of TMA is critical so that appropriate treatment can be initiated.\nThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura\nTTP is a life-threatening disease arising from primary hemostatic abnormalities. Under physi- ologic conditions, von Willebrand factor (VWF) mediates platelet binding to subendothelial col- lagen at sites of vascular injury; during this process, activated endothelial cells release VWF in multimerized forms that are then cleaved by the ADAMTS13 metalloproteinase. In patients with TTP, a deficiency or functional impairment in ADAMTS13 leads to the accumulation of ultra- large VWF multimers, which results in the for- mation of microvascular platelet\u2013VWF plugs that cause shearing of red cells. Under normal condi- tions, ADAMTS13 activity levels are usually above 50%; ADAMTS13 activity levels below 10% are diagnostic of TTP, whereas levels exceeding 20% indicate that this diagnosis is unlikely.2\nAt many hospitals, the wait time for the re- sults of testing for ADAMTS13 activity levels can be days or weeks. The PLASMIC score is a useful gauge of pretest probability of TTP that incorpo- rates seven readily available clinical and labora- tory variables (platelet count, levels of hemolytic markers, active cancer, previous solid-organ or stem-cell transplantation, mean corpuscular vol- ume, international normalized ratio, and creati- nine level).3 Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with delays in the treatment of TTP, patients with TMA and a high PLASMIC score are often treated empirically for TTP until the results of ADAMTS13 testing become avail- able,2 as was the case with this patient. The mainstay of therapy for TTP is plasmapheresis, which replenishes ADAMTS13 and removes pos- sible autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, with adjunctive use of glucocorticoid therapy, ritux- imab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody), and caplacizumab (an anti-VWF bivalent nanobody).4 In this patient, the ADAMTS13 activity level of more than 20% and the lack of response to plas- mapheresis and rituximab make the diagnosis of TTP unlikely.\nHemolytic\u2013Uremic   Syndrome Hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome (HUS) is a hetero- geneous group of TMAs that arise from endothe- lial injury and predominantly affect the renal glomeruli.5 Classic HUS is characterized by bloody diarrhea that occurs after consumption of undercooked meats contaminated with Shiga toxin\u2013producing bacteria, which cause direct endothelial injury.\nAtypical HUS is a complement-mediated dis- order, in which germline mutations in \u2014 or autoantibodies against \u2014 alternative-pathway\n \ncomplement-regulating factors lead to uncon- trolled formation of the membrane-attack com- plex and consequent renal glomerular damage.  In patients with atypical HUS, the presentation varies and often resembles TTP. Although a periph- eral-blood smear will show abundant schisto- cytes in both conditions, renal impairment is a predominant clinical feature of atypical HUS, whereas neurologic impairment is more common with TTP. With atypical HUS, germline comple- ment mutations or autoantibodies to alternative- pathway complement-regulating factors are found in 50 to 70% of cases, and a low C3 level with a normal C4 level occurs in half of cases \u2014 fac- tors that together indicate activation of the alter- native complement cascade. Complement inhibi- tion with the use of eculizumab or ravulizumab is an effective therapy for atypical HUS. In this patient, the lack of response to eculizumab makes a diagnosis of atypical HUS unlikely.\n\nDisseminated Intravascular Coagulation Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a form of MAHA that arises from abnormal ac- tivation of the coagulation cascade, which leads to microvascular thrombosis, with the consump- tion of endogenous anticoagulants, excessive generation of fibrin, and the development of fibrinolytic derangements.6 A scoring system es- tablished by the International Society on Throm-\nbosis and Haemostasis incorporates four labora- tory test results (d-dimer level, fibrinogen level, prothrombin time, and platelet count) to deter- mine the pretest probability of overt DIC.7 The most common causes of DIC are infection, can- cer, trauma, or complications from pregnancy. The evaluation for DIC must therefore include a search for the underlying trigger in order to treat DIC effectively. In this patient, the marked eleva- tion in the d-dimer level, the presence of throm- bocytopenia, and the prolonged prothrombin time are all consistent with a diagnosis of DIC, although an underlying trigger was not readily apparent.\n\nMalignant Hypertension\nMalignant hypertension is characterized by severe hypertension with end-organ damage, which can lead to microvascular thrombosis and TMA as a result of severe sclerosis and fibrinoid necrosis of the renal vasculature.8 The mainstay of treat- ment is antihypertensive therapy. In this patient,hypertension developed only after the onset of MAHA, a pattern that is not consistent with a diagnosis of malignant hypertension.\n\nDrug-Induced TMA\nSeveral drugs, including immunosuppressive ther- apy, antineoplastic medications, and cocaine, have been reported to cause TMA.9 Drug-induced TMA may be immunologically mediated by anti- bodies with specificity against endothelial or other inflammatory cells, or it may arise as a result of a toxic effect of a drug on endothelial cells. The primary treatment is cessation of the offending agent. This patient was not taking any medications that are associated with TMA, which makes drug-induced TMA unlikely.\n\nCatastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an auto- immune  disease  in  which  autoantibodies  to\n\u03b22-glycoprotein I lead to thrombotic or obstetrical complications. Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a se- vere phenotype of APS that is characterized by\nthe occurrence of multiple thrombotic events, with multiorgan damage, microvascular throm- bosis, and, in many cases, TMA. Complement derangements arising from germline complement mutations are believed to underlie the progres- sion from APS to CAPS.10 Treatment of CAPS consists of anticoagulation, glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, and, in some cases, comple- ment inhibition.11 In this patient, tests for anti- phospholipid antibodies (i.e., lupus anticoagu- lant  and  antibodies  against  cardiolipin  and\n\u03b22-glycoprotein I) were negative, findings that rule out APS.\n\nScleroderma Renal Crisis\nSystemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, is an autoimmune disease characterized by pro- gressive fibrosis of the skin and other organs. In patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclero- sis, the fibrosis may affect the renal vasculature, which can lead to scleroderma renal crisis with AKI, rapid-onset hypertension, and TMA.12 Digi- tal nailfold capillaroscopy, which evaluates for microvascular damage, may identify patients who are at risk for scleroderma renal crisis and other systemic microvascular involvement. Scleroderma renal crisis is associated with glucocorticoid use and RNA polymerase III antibodies. Glomerulo- nephritis is not a characteristic feature, and the\n \nurinary sediment is often bland. Antihyperten- sive treatment is the mainstay of therapy. This patient had cutaneous systemic sclerosis associ- ated with RNA polymerase III antibodies, as well as hypertension and renal impairment, findings that suggest scleroderma renal crisis. However, hypertension developed only after her initial presentation with TMA, and muddy-brown casts were present in the urinary sediment, a finding that is suggestive of acute tubular necrosis; these characteristics are not consistent with the diag- nosis of scleroderma renal crisis.\n\nCancer-Associated TMA\nCancer-associated TMA is a devastating condi- tion, in which intravascular fibrin deposition and microvascular occlusion arise from tumor cells in the microcirculation and lead to MAHA.13,14 Classically, cancer-associated TMA occurs in patients with adenocarcinomas, particularly of gastric, pulmonary, breast, or prostatic origin; bone marrow infiltration and pulmonary tumor microembolism are common, and most affected patients have laboratory evidence of DIC. In ad- dition to showing schistocytes, the peripheral- blood smear often shows evidence of leuko- erythroblastosis with left-shifted myeloid cells, nucleated red cells, and teardrop cells, findings indicative of myelophthisis of the bone marrow by metastatic cancer. Antineoplastic therapy is the only appropriate treatment for cancer-associ- ated TMA. The mortality associated with this condition is high, approaching 50% within a month after presentation with TMA.1\nThis patient had laboratory test results that\nwere suggestive of DIC, and her history of breast cancer suggests the possibility of cancer-associ- ated TMA. A bone marrow biopsy performed at the other hospital was negative for cancer; how- ever, the sensitivity of bone marrow biopsy for the detection of metastatic disease is only ap- proximately 50%. The patient\u2019s peripheral-blood smear showed left-shifted myeloid cells, nucle- ated red cells, and teardrop cells, in addition to abundant schistocytes, findings that are sugges- tive of myelophthisis of the marrow. Given the constellation of TMA, DIC, leukoerythroblastic findings on a peripheral-blood smear, and a his- tory of breast cancer, I suspect that she had cancer-associated TMA from breast cancer. A repeat bone marrow biopsy would probably con- firm the diagnosis of metastatic disease.Two other features of this patient\u2019s case that are unrelated to TMA merit discussion. One is the markedly elevated blood level of ferritin, which I suspect was caused by metastatic can- cer.15 The other feature is proteinuria, which probably resulted from nephrosis due to breast cancer.\n\n\n",

Contemporaneously performed whole-body CT revealed no suspicious lytic or blastic bone  lesions  that correlated with the pattern of FDG uptake. There were no sites of suspicious extraskeletal abnormal uptake.\nA diffuse increase of FDG uptake in the bone marrow could be due to bone marrow reconversion or cancer. A homogeneous and uniform uptake pattern would suggest reactive bone marrow due to inflammation associated with cancer, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulat- ing factor, or long-standing severe anemia. This patient had a diffuse heterogeneous pattern of uptake, which was suggestive of osseous metas- tasis of malignant tumor or lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative diseases such as lymphoma or leukemia. Given her history of breast cancer, there was a high suspicion for recurrent meta- static breast cancer, and tissue sampling of the bone marrow was recommended.\n",
