    "Primary Symptom": "A 65-Year-Old Woman with Rapidly Progressive Weakness in the Right Arm and Recurrent Falls",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Marina Avetisyan (Neurology, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and recurrent falls.\nTwelve years before this admission, the patient noted worsening gait and bal- ance disturbance, which slowly progressed, and falls began to occur 5 years before this admission. Her medical history included measles encephalitis, which had been diagnosed when she was 6 years of age and had resulted in weakness on the left side, severe vision and hearing impairment, and gait and balance disturbance. After rehabilitation therapy, her balance and gait apparently normalized, but she had mild residual weakness on the left side, which resulted in a change from left- hand to right-hand dominance.\nTwo years before this admission, the patient was evaluated in the neurology clinic of this hospital. She reported difficulties with balance, which worsened with head turning. She reported no disequilibrium, vertigo, back pain, paresthesia, or numbness. On examination, her cognitive function was intact, and although her speech was dysarthric and hypophonic, these abnormalities could have been as- sociated with her hearing loss. The cranial-nerve examination revealed abnormal eye movements, with square-wave jerks, saccadic pursuit, and bilateral horizontal nystagmus. The hearing and vision were severely reduced. The muscle bulk was decreased throughout, and tone was normal. Motor strength was full and sym- metric in the arms and legs bilaterally, and contractures were present in the fin- gers of the left hand. Reflexes were reduced or absent throughout, and plantar reflexes were extensor bilaterally. Vibratory sensation was reduced at the great toes but was otherwise normal. The patient had appendicular dysmetria on both finger- to-nose testing and heel-to-shin testing that was greater on the left side than on the right side. Her gait was wide-based, and she was unable to walk with a tandem gait. The Romberg sign was present.\nNeedle electromyographic findings and the results of nerve-conduction studies were normal, as were findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial. MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine re- vealed mild multilevel degenerative disk disease without clinically significant spinal-canal steno- sis. A lumbar puncture was performed; analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed 0 nucle- ated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), and oligoclonal bands were absent. Tests of the CSF and serum for antibodies associated with autoimmune and paraneoplastic encephalitis were negative (Table 1). The patient underwent physi- cal therapy, and her symptoms stabilized.\nThree months before this admission, weak-\nness in the right hand and right arm developed. The patient initially attributed the weakness to fatigue, since it had occurred during a time of increased physical activity associated with mov- ing to a different apartment. However, the weak- ness did not abate, and 2 months before this admission, she was again evaluated in the neurol- ogy clinic of this hospital. She noted difficulty with communicating in sign language and with holding objects in her right hand because of weakness and had started using her left hand to eat. She reported no neck, arm, or leg pain and no sensory loss. Her gait and balance were sta- ble, with no recent falls.\nOn examination, there was reduced facial\nexpression and reduced muscle bulk and tone throughout. The right shoulder was dropped, with weakness in the right trapezius and re- duced active shoulder abduction that was limited to 70 degrees, without pain on shoulder abduc- tion. There was predominantly proximal weak- ness in the right arm; the muscle strength was 4\u2212/5  on  shoulder  abduction  and  external  rota- tion,  4+/5  on  elbow  f lexion,  and  4/5  on  elbow extension, wrist extension, and abductor digiti minimi and finger extension. The strength in the right leg was normal. There was subtle weakness on the left side that involved wrist and finger extension and great toe extension. Deep- tendon reflexes were 2+ at the right biceps and 1+ at the left biceps and were otherwise areflexic throughout. Sensation was intact in the arms, but there was decreased vibratory sensation and proprioception at the great toes; sensation was\n \notherwise normal. Moderate appendicular dys- metria was present in the arms and legs. The patient\u2019s gait, which was assessed while she was using her white cane (the type of cane com- monly used by blind or visually impaired per- sons), was wide-based; she took excessively large steps and reached out once to touch the wall. Neurologic examination was otherwise unchanged from the examination performed 2 years earlier. Additional studies were obtained.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: MRI of the head, per- formed without the administration of intrave- nous contrast material, was reported to be nor- mal. MRI of the cervical spine was also performed without the administration of contrast material; T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed signal hyperintensity in the suboccipital and paraspinal soft tissues that was consistent with edema. Areas of intrin- sic hyperintense signal that were consistent with fatty atrophy were seen on T1-weighted imaging. There were diffuse degenerative changes with mild spinal-canal stenosis at C4\u2013C5, without cord compression.\nDr. Avetisyan: Repeat needle electromyography\nrevealed no recorded motor units in the right deltoid or infraspinatus muscles, with complex repetitive discharges in the right cervical para- spinal and deltoid muscles. Nerve-conduction studies revealed mild reduction in the ampli- tudes of the bilateral median and right ulnar sensory responses; the sensory responses of the right radial, bilateral antebrachial cutaneous, and bilateral medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves were normal, as were the motor respons- es of the right median and right ulnar nerves.\nDuring the ensuing 2 months, the weakness in the right arm progressed rapidly, which caused the patient to have difficulty ambulating with her white cane (she was unable to walk with a standard cane), making walking unsafe after frequent falls and rendering her practically bedbound. She had no pain or numbness in her arm. She was ultimately unable to care for her- self at home and was admitted to this hospital for further evaluation.\nOther medical history included hypercholes- terolemia and hypothyroidism. Medications in- cluded ascorbic acid, vitamin B complex, coen- zyme Q10, vitamin E, calcium carbonate and cholecalciferol, and levothyroxine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone and worked for a nonprofit agency. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank four glasses of wine per week, and did not use illicit drugs. She re- ported that her father had died from Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease when he was 71 years of age,\n7 months after the onset of symptoms. Her mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which was di- agnosed when she was in her 60s; she was cur- rently living in a nursing home. The patient had four siblings; one had died at 46 years of age from an intracerebral hemorrhage, and her re- maining three siblings were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 35.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 116/64 mm Hg, the pulse 61 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) was\n15.8. The patient appeared emaciated but was able to sit up in a chair and hold her head up. Strength in her right arm had decreased to 2/5 on shoulder shrug, shoulder abduction, elbow flex- ion, and elbow extension, with 3/5 strength on wrist extension and finger flexion and extension. There was new proximal weakness in the right leg, with 4/5 strength on right hip flexion. The strength in the left arm was unchanged. Deep- tendon reflexes were 3+ at the right biceps and 2+ at the brachioradialis and were otherwise absent throughout. She had ataxia as well as oc- casional jerks that involved the legs (with the left leg affected to a greater extent than the right leg) and were possibly stimulus-induced. The re- mainder of the neurologic examination was un- changed from the last visit.\nDr. Schaefer: MRI of the head, performed be-\nfore and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a new linear signal on susceptibility-weighted imaging but also a marked decrease in subtle restricted diffusion on diffu- sion-weighted imaging and hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging (identified in retrospect on the previous MRI) in the left frontal and left parietal lobes (Fig. 1). MRI of the whole spine, per- formed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, was unchanged from previous imaging.\nDr. Avetisyan: The creatine kinase level was normal.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Christopher D. Stephen: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the diagnosis in this case. I was the first neurologist to see this patient after a long interval; on examina- tion, it appeared that her longstanding ataxia was generally similar to that seen at her assess- ment 2 years earlier, albeit having perhaps slightly worsened symptomatically over time, and should be considered separately. However, the more pressing matter is the development of subacute and subsequently rapidly progressive weakness in her right arm, which later spread to involve her right leg. The time course in which this weakness developed is important, since it provides insight into the types of processes that can lead to the rapid progression of symptoms and signs seen in this patient.1-3\n\nRapidly Progressive Weakness\nFirst, in this patient with rapidly progressive weakness in the right arm and right leg, we must consider whether the weakness is caused by a central process or a peripheral process (Fig. 2). The pyramidal distribution of weakness in the arm, followed by weakness in the leg and findings on electromyography, are suggestive of a central process. Despite the presence of global muscular atrophy, the paretic limbs are not af- fected to a greater extent than the nonparetic limbs, and there are no signs that the patient has a primary muscle disorder, given the upper motor neuron features, the normal creatine ki- nase level, and the absence of associated myo- pathic findings on electromyography.\nThe absence of fatigable weakness, of symp-\ntoms that are more global or symmetric, and of ocular and bulbar weakness, as well as the pres- ence of increased reflexes, make a neuromuscu- lar-junction disorder highly unlikely in this case. Although progressive peripheral nerve and root disorders and other lower motor neuron condi- tions are common causes of rapidly progressive weakness, the features in this patient that could be interpreted as lower motor neuron signs are longstanding, and no neuropathic features are present on electromyography, with features in- stead suggestive of a central process.5\nAnterior-horn-cell disease is important to\nconsider in this case, since amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis can be rapidly progressive and often start in a limb, with subsequent spread.6 However, the pyrami- dal distribution of weakness and the absence of acute or chronic neurogenic features on elec- tromyography (e.g., fibrillations, sharp waves, spontaneous activity, or change in motor-unit action potential) make anterior-horn-cell disease unlikely. Diseases at the level of the spinal cord\n\u2014 which are generally related to compressive, inflammatory, or ischemic insults to the right side of the spinal cord (in the case of unilat- eral weakness) \u2014 can be ruled out on the basis\n \nof the negative findings on spine imaging in this case.\n\nDiseases of the Brain\nThis leads us to a localization of this patient\u2019s disease at the level of the brain, given the imag- ing findings involving the left frontal and pari- etal lobes. Such imaging findings are most often associated with ischemia, whether related to stroke or to cerebral venous thrombosis; how- ever, the subacute, and later acute, tempo of progression that occurred in this patient makes ischemia unlikely. There is no indication of sei- zures or hypoxia, either of which can result in cortical-based changes.\nOther important considerations in this case are infectious or inflammatory diseases that can cause cerebritis, such as herpes simplex encephalitis, rabies, and autoimmune encephalitis, al- though these diseases are almost always accompa- nied by cognitive decline or encephalopathy.7,8 This group of disorders also includes prion disease, which must be considered, particularly given the patient\u2019s family history. However, this patient\u2019s presentation, with weakness as the primary fea- ture, is highly atypical for prion disease. The absence of features that would suggest an active infection and the absence of an elevated protein level in the CSF, which could indicate an autoim- mune disorder, make an autoimmune or infectious encephalitis-like process unlikely, albeit not impos- sible. There are no metabolic derangements, and other inflammatory conditions, such as MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acido- sis, and strokelike episodes), would be unlikely.\n\nMyoclonus\nIn addition to weakness, this patient has new jerking movements in the legs that are sugges- tive of myoclonus. When evaluating a patient with suspected myoclonus, it is important to first determine whether the process is cortical or subcortical or whether it has a spinal or more peripheral origin (Fig. 3).9,10 Certain findings in this patient do not suggest segmental or pro- priospinal myoclonus; these include the absence of a spinal lesion, the fact that the distribution of jerking involves the legs and not the hips or trunk (whereas propriopsinal myoclonus typically involves axial f lexion jerks), and the patient\u2019s electromyographic features.11,12 In addition, the location of the jerking movements is not within a plexus, root, or individual peripheral nerve dis- tribution, locations that would suggest periph- eral myoclonus.13\nSubcortical myoclonus originates between the\ncortex and the spinal cord, is typically bilateral, and may be global in distribution. This patient has no features that would suggest a brain-stem origin; in addition, she is not receiving any medications that could be associated with sub- cortical myoclonus and has no reported toxic exposures or metabolic features that could result in such a diagnosis. The findings seen on this patient\u2019s imaging, which is based primarily in the cortical region, are instead suggestive of cortical myoclonus.\nCortical myoclonus is caused by intrinsic cor- tical hyperexcitability, which may be focal, seg- mental, or multifocal.13 Although cortical myo-\n \nclonus tends to involve the hands and face most often, it is a likely diagnosis in this case, given that this patient\u2019s muscle jerks occur primarily in the paretic limbs and appear to be stimulus- sensitive and that the imaging findings are lo- calized to the cortex. The patient does not have associated epilepsy or encephalopathy, and the clinical progression is more rapid than that typically associated with any of the myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, which are not manifested by similar weakness.14 No metabolic cause has been identified in this patient; a metabolic cause would usually produce a generalized myoclonus and would not be associated with unilateral weakness. Infectious or paraneoplastic encepha- lopathies are generally not associated with uni- lateral weakness and would be unlikely diagno- ses in this case.8,15 This patient\u2019s progression is much faster than would be seen in a degenera- tive basal ganglia disorder such as corticobasal syndrome, which can be manifested by strik- ingly unilateral dystonia and is frequently asso- ciated with myoclonus and cortical sensory loss.\nCreutzfeldt\u2013Jakob Disease\nWe must then consider the unusual nature of this patient\u2019s presentation and the associated rapid progression in the context of her family history of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease \u2014 a rapidly progressive disorder that is typically associated with the development of dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus, inexorably progressing to akinetic mutism and death. We do not know what symp- toms this patient\u2019s father had, and because Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease is typically a disorder of unknown cause, it is important to be aware that genetic forms of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease exist and that they manifest in an autosomal dominant manner, which would be compatible with inheritance from her father.16 A diagnosis of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease would also be com- patible with the cortical ribboning (a ribbonlike signal hyperintensity involving the cerebral cor- tical gyri) seen on this patient\u2019s imaging, which is an ominous sign and is highly suggestive of prion disease.17,18 Although rapidly progressive weakness is an atypical finding in patients with Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, other prion disorders such as the Gerstmann\u2013Str\u00e4ussler\u2013Scheinker syndrome can be associated with a neuromuscu- lar phenotype involving weakness, areflexia, and paresthesia, albeit with far slower progression than that seen in this case.19 The rapidity of this patient\u2019s disease progression, combined with the known diagnosis of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in her father, are highly suggestive of a genetic form of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Derek H. Oakley: A lumbar puncture was per- formed, and cytologic analysis of the CSF showed no evidence of pleocytosis or malignant cells. The CSF level of total tau was 1066 pg per milli- liter (reference range, 0 to 1149), and CSF testing for 14-3-3 protein was negative. However, a real- time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) test for the detection of prion protein was positive; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease,20 this result is consistent with probable prion disease in the context of a neuro- psychiatric disorder. A diagnosis of definite prion disease requires neuropathological or biochemi- cal evaluation of brain tissue and thus was not possible at this time. The reference laboratory that performed the RT-QuIC test (the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center; NPDPSC) interpreted the result as probable prion disease with a likelihood of greater than 98%.\nDr. Stephen: Given the suspicion for Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease, additional history was obtained. The patient\u2019s sister reported that the patient\u2019s uncle (her father\u2019s fraternal twin) had also died from Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, which provided further support for a diagnosis of hereditary Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease. There are striking similarities between the initial presentations of the patient and her relatives.\nAt 59 years of age, the patient\u2019s uncle began to have sensory symptoms in the left hand that were initially diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome. He subsequently had rapidly progressive weakness in his left hand, weakness in his right leg, and dysarthria. Spasticity with hyperreflexia developed, with loss of proprioception and vibra- tory perception, generalized ataxia, and cervical dystonia, and he was admitted to this hospital. Shortly thereafter, he began to have widespread myoclonic jerks and decreased responsiveness. Electroencephalography revealed general slowing and disorganization, with infrequent spike com- plexes. He died 4 months after the onset of symp- toms in his left hand. An autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease.\nThe patient\u2019s father began to have weakness\nin his right hand when he was 71 years of age, shortly after diagnosis of primary lung  cancer. The weakness progressed to the right leg and the face, and dysarthria and dysphagia devel- oped. Spasticity and hyperreflexia subsequently developed, with loss of temperature and vibra- tory perception in the feet and legs and ataxia on the right side. Electromyography suggested a motor axonal neuropathy. Akinetic mutism rap- idly ensued after he was admitted to an affiliated hospital. Electroencephalography revealed the presence of bilateral spikes and polyspikes at irregular intervals. CSF evaluation was negative for 14-3-3 protein. MRI of the head revealed hy- perintensities in the cortical ribbon on diffusion- weighted images involving the left paramedian cortex adjacent to the falx, insula, right anterior temporal lobe, and frontal lobes. He died 7 months after the onset of weakness. An autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease.\nBecause the patient\u2019s father and uncle both\nhad rapidly progressive weakness that began in an arm, followed by ataxia and myoclonus, and ultimately received a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease that was confirmed by autopsy, blood samples were obtained from this patient and were sent to the NPDPSC for genetic testing for pathogenic mutations of the prion protein gene (PRNP). Cases of monoparesis associated with genetic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease are ex- ceedingly rare; in a large case series reported by Cohen et al.,21 such a case was seen in only 1 of 77 patients.\nDr. Brian S. Appleby: Genetic prion disease is caused by point mutations or insertions or deletions in an octapeptide region of PRNP. Genetic testing was performed in this patient as part of the comprehensive neuropathological evaluation con- ducted by the NPDPSC (https://case.edu/medicine/ pathology/divisions/prion-center/).  Genetic  analy- sis of PRNP was performed by the Center for Human Genetics Laboratory at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center; the protocol for this analysis has been described previous- ly.22 The patient was found to have the E200K mutation and methionine homozygosity at codon 129, resulting in the E200K-129M haplotype. The patient\u2019s uncle had also undergone genetic analysis through the NPDPSC and had been found to have the same haplotype (E200K-129M) and valine at codon 129 of the nonmutated al- lele. Genetic analysis was not available for the patient\u2019s father. E200K is the most common mutation that causes genetic Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease worldwide, with an age-related pene- trance that approaches 100%.23 Although most cases of prion disease with an E200K mutation are associated with a Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease phenotype, clinical heterogeneity has been noted.21\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",
