    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Denis T. Balaban (Neurology): A 59-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus was transferred to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU) of this hospital in the winter because of obtundation.\nThe evening before this presentation, the patient was observed by her neighbor to be sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a vehicle in her driveway. The following morn- ing, she remained seated in the same position and was found to be unresponsive; the neighbor attempted to wake her but could not. On arrival of emergency medi- cal services personnel, intranasal naloxone was administered but did not have any effect on her mental status. The patient was transported to the emergency depart- ment of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn arrival at the emergency department, the patient was unable to provide any history. She did not open her eyes but moaned in response to tactile stimulation and withdrew her arms and legs in response to noxious stimulation. The pupils were 4 mm in diameter and reactive to light. Corneal, oculocephalic, and gag re- flexes were present. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetric in the arms and absent in the legs; the Babinski sign was present bilaterally. A pump for continuous subcu- taneous insulin infusion was in place. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe blood glucose level was 321 mg per deciliter (17.8 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 100 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 5.6 mmol per liter]). Blood levels of elec- trolytes, calcium, albumin, lactate, ammonia, troponin, thyrotropin, carboxyhe- moglobin, and methemoglobin were normal, as were results of renal-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of more than 1.030 and the presence of protein, glucose, and ketones. Urine and blood toxicologic screening was negative. The insulin pump was interrogated, and there had been no hypoglycemic episodes in the pre- ceding week. Specimens of blood were obtained for culture.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the intravenous administration of contrast material, revealed sub- tle, symmetric increased attenuation in the basal ganglia, thalami, and dentate nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed extensive signal loss in the basal ganglia, thalami,dentate nuclei, and leptomeningeal surfaces on gradient echo images.\nDr. Balaban: A lumbar puncture was per- formed; results of cerebrospinal f luid (CSF) analysis are shown in Table 1. Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF showed rare neutrophils with no or- ganisms. Cultures were performed. Tests of the CSF for herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 DNA and syphilis were negative, as was examination of a smear for acid-fast bacilli. Cytologic studies of the CSF showed rare atypical cells.\nElectroencephalography showed generalized slowing without epileptiform activity. Vancomy- cin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were administered. During the next 2 days, the patient\u2019s mental status did not improve. Cultures of blood and CSF obtained 48 hours previously showed no growth. The patient was transferred by ambu- lance to the neurology ICU of this hospital for further evaluation.\nOn arrival at this hospital, the patient was unable to answer questions, and additional his- tory was obtained from her medical records. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus had been made when she was 19 years of age, and the disease had been complicated by diabetic reti- nopathy. Other medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukemia, ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (for which she had undergone lumpectomy), chronic anemia, asthma, and ar- thritis due to Lyme disease. Medications included rituximab administered every 3 months for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, sub- cutaneous insulin infusion, and inhaled budeso- nide and albuterol; letrozole had been prescribed, but the patient had not taken the medication for the preceding 3 months. The patient had aller- gies to penicillin, cephalexin, and ciprofloxacin. She lived with her adult daughter in a suburban community in New England; her husband had died of renal cell carcinoma 4 years earlier. She did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had had a history of hypertension and essential thrombocytosis, and her father had had type 2 diabetes mellitus. A maternal aunt had died of breast cancer at an unknown age, and another maternal aunt had had ovarian cancer.\nOn examination, the patient opened her eyes\nand moaned in response to sternal rub and showed purposeful movement toward changing painful stimuli. Her pupils were 4 mm and reac- tive to light. She blinked appropriately in re- sponse to confrontational threat in all fields. The oculocephalic reflex was present, and her face appeared symmetric. The remainder of the evaluation was normal.\nBlood levels of cobalamin and cortisol were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. On a repeat lumbar puncture, the opening pressure was 14 cm of water; other results are shown in Table 1. Tests of the CSF for Lyme disease and for enterovirus, varicella virus, and West Nile virus infection were performed.\nDr. Rapalino: Repeat MRI of the head con- firmed the presence of diffuse, symmetric hypo- intensity on T2-weighted images and showed abnormal susceptibility signal throughout the basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei, and cor- tical surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres on susceptibility-weighted images (Fig. 1).\nDr. Balaban: Electroencephalography showed generalized polymorphic theta slowing in the background and frequent, prolonged runs of bi- frontal irregular delta activity with embedded bifrontal low-amplitude blunt discharges.\nVancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were continued, and meropenem was administered intravenously. During the next 3 days, the pa- tient began to open her eyes spontaneously, move her arms and legs independently, and fol- low commands intermittently. Increased tone was noted in the legs and arms. Cultures of blood and CSF obtained 72 hours previously showed no growth. The CSF tests for Lyme dis- ease and for enterovirus, varicella virus, and West Nile virus infection were negative. Vanco- mycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir were discontin- ued, and the patient was transferred from the ICU to the neurology unit.\nAdditional history was obtained from the patient\u2019s neighbors, outpatient endocrinologist, and family. Two years before this presentation, the patient\u2019s neighbors had noted the develop- ment of suspicious and paranoid beliefs. For example, the patient believed that her computer was being used to spy on her and gather per- sonal information, and she repeatedly asked them to help fix the device.\nApproximately 21 months before this presen- tation, the patient\u2019s endocrinologist had noted the development of confusion. The patient began to contact her physician\u2019s office repeatedly, often several times daily. Whereas she had previously managed her diabetes with a high degree of sophistication, she began to ask questions that suggested she was having difficulty with basic diabetes management. Her telephone calls con- tained many unrelated and, at times, nonsensi- cal questions; emails were similarly tangential and incoherent. When she was asked about these changes, the patient reported that her cognitive function was as \u201csharp as a tack\u201d and that her emails were confusing because of \u201cslow Internet speed.\u201d During an office visit with her endocri- nologist, the Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE) score was 24 on a scale ranging from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cog- nitive function; points were deducted because the patient had made errors of short-term object re- call, attention, and calculation. The patient was referred to the outpatient neurology clinic of the other hospital for further evaluation, but she did not attend the scheduled visit.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, the patient\u2019s family had noted that she had sent individualized holiday gifts to incorrect family members. In the accompanying holiday cards, her penmanship, which had previously been neat, was nearly illegible and was likened by family members to a child\u2019s handwriting.\nDuring the current hospitalization, the patient continued to show slow neurologic improvement with supportive care. She was able to answer questions in short sentences, was oriented to self but not to time or place, and was unable to pro- vide further history about the events that led to her hospitalization.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. David N. Caplan: This 59-year-old woman pre- sented with a 2-year history of cognitive decline that culminated in an episode in which she was found unresponsive in her car on a winter morn- ing. I will develop my differential diagnosis in two steps, considering this patient\u2019s symptoms (reports of disturbances) and signs (observations of abnormal functioning) to localize lesions in the nervous system and determine the time course of her disease.\n\nLocalization of Cognitive Symptoms and Signs The localizing value of this patient\u2019s cognitive symptoms and signs depends on the aspects of cognition that are affected. Her history suggests disturbances primarily affecting integrative cog- nitive functions, including fixation of belief (paranoia), reasoning (asking unrelated and non- sensical questions and sending tangential and incoherent emails), complex planning (difficulty with diabetes management), and metacognition (anosognosia). Sending incoherent messages to her endocrinologist and inappropriate holiday cards could have arisen from deficits in the basic cognitive domains of language and memory, or these behaviors could have resulted from errors in formulating thoughts. The patient\u2019s MMSE results suggest problems in memory and math- ematics; the test of attention on the MMSE is digit span, which measures a form of memory.\nThe information we have that characterizes this patient\u2019s cognitive deficits provides limited help in localizing her neurologic disease. Inte- grative cognitive functions are not narrowly lo- calized. Disturbances of these functions may result from lesions involving the frontal lobes, but they can also be manifestations of multifo- cal cortical disease or of lesions involving the white-matter tracts, deep nuclei, or cerebellum.\n\nTime Course of Symptoms\nThe time course of a cognitive disorder can be categorized as acute (occurring over minutes to days), subacute (occurring over a week to several months), or chronic. Chronic and subacute dis- orders can be progressive or static; if they are progressive, they can have a gradual course or a stepwise course, in which changes occur infre- quently and suddenly. This patient\u2019s cognitive disturbances were chronic and progressive with a gradual course. This makes many diagnoses unlikely, including conditions that have a rapid time course (e.g., Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, Hashi- moto\u2019s encephalopathy, and many neoplastic dis- eases) and conditions that cause recurrent or discrete events (e.g., stroke and multiple sclero- sis). Several categories of disorders remain, in- cluding psychiatric diseases, medical diseases with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and neurologic diseases, such as degenerative disease, cerebral microvascular disease, and im- munologic disease or cancer with neurologic effects. Because there was no mention of psychi- atric disease in the patient\u2019s history, a psychiat- ric diagnosis is unlikely in this case.\n\nMedical Diseases with CNS Involvement\nThis patient had a history of diabetes. A mani- festation of diabetes that commonly causes cog- nitive problems is cerebral microvascular disease. Although diabetes-associated microvascular dis- ease is a diagnostic consideration in this case, the findings on MRI are not consistent with this diagnosis.\nBreast cancer can be associated with meta- static and paraneoplastic neurologic disease. This patient had a history of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, which can recur and metastasize. However, she had no evidence of local recur- rence. Approximately 8% of cases of paraneo- plastic limbic encephalitis are associated with breast cancer.1 Patients with paraneoplastic lim- bic encephalitis can present with acute or subacute onset of confusion, short-term memory loss, or seizures. Although paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis has been reported in patients with stage II breast cancer, to my knowledge, this condition has not been reported in patients with carcinoma in situ.2\nThis patient also had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which spreads to the brain and meninges fairly frequently; however, CNS involvement is rarely symptomatic. One review showed that 0.4% of patients with chronic lym- phocytic leukemia had CNS symptoms that were attributable to spread of the disease.3 Most pa- tients with symptomatic CNS disease have cranial- nerve palsies; 15% have an altered mental state, and 12% have cognitive decline.3,4 Diffuse large- cell non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (Richter\u2019s syn- drome) can develop in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and may be present only in the brain.5 Progressive multifocal leukoen- cephalopathy has been reported in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, especially those who have been treated with rituximab.6 Both of these conditions lead to death fairly rapidly. This patient\u2019s CSF showed rare atypical cells, a find- ing that suggests the possibility that her chronic lymphocytic leukemia had spread to the CNS. This might have contributed to her chronic symptoms but is unlikely to explain all the fea- tures of her presentation.\nNeurologic Disease\nThe neurologic diseases that are most likely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s gradual cognitive decline include cerebral microvascular disease, degenerative disease (e.g., early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease, various forms of frontotemporal demen- tia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Lewy body disease), normal-pressure hydrocephalus, slow-growing cancer, and some infectious diseases. The patient\u2019s neurologic findings (Babinski signs, increased tone, and absence of reflexes in the lower legs) are insufficient to make a diagnosis; however, the neuroimaging studies are striking and may point us toward several uncommon diseases.\n\nFindings on MRI\nLow signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging can be caused by gadolinium-based contrast material, hemoglobin-breakdown products, melanin, mucus- or protein-containing lesions, highly cellular le- sions, turbulent and rapid blood and CSF flow, air, and excessive mineralization.7 Contrast agents, melanin, and proteinaceous materials would be associated with hyperintensity on T1- weighted imaging. Highly cellular malignant tumors, flow voids, air-containing spaces, and cerebral bleeding would not be associated with the distribution of lesions seen in this case.7 Cerebral hemorrhages that result from aneu- rysms, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangiomas, venous anomalies, or capillary telangiectasias are usually produced by solitary lesions, unless they are associated with the Osler\u2013 Weber\u2013Rendu syndrome, ataxia\u2013telangiectasia, or the Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome.8 The multiple small hemorrhages that are seen in patients with hy- pertensive vasculopathy would not occur in the cortex to the extent seen in this case.9 The le- sions associated with cerebral amyloid angiopa- thy would be expected to produce large lobar hemorrhages.10 The combination of hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy would not be expected to occur in such a sym- metric distribution.\nExcessive Mineralization\nThe most likely explanation of this patient\u2019s ab- normalities on CT and MRI is excessive miner- alization, most commonly of calcium, copper, manganese, or iron. Primary familial brain cal- cification (Fahr\u2019s disease) produces calcium de- posits in the basal nuclei but also in the dentate nuclei, thalami, and cerebral white matter.11 The extensive cortical lesions seen in this case are not typical of Fahr\u2019s disease.\nWilson\u2019s disease, caused by excess copper, can result in lesions with hyperintensity, hypoin- tensity, or mixed intensity in the putamen, glo- bus pallidus, caudate nucleus, and thalamus. In addition, scattered abnormal signals have been observed in the cerebral cortex, temporal lobe (in 3.3% of cases), parietal lobe (3.3%), and fron- tal lobe (3.2%) but not in the occipital lobe or to the extent seen in this case.12\nAcute manganism, caused by excess manga- nese, is a disorder that can cause behavioral disturbances, hallucinations, and psychosis (known as \u201cmanganese madness,\u201d or \u201clocura manganica\u201d). However, chronic manganism leads to extrapyramidal symptoms,13 and excess man- ganese is usually bright on T1-weighted imag- ing.14 Furthermore, Fahr\u2019s disease, Wilson\u2019s dis- ease, and manganism would not explain this patient\u2019s abnormal levels of iron, total iron- binding capacity, and ferritin in serum.\n\nIron Deposition\nThis patient\u2019s MRI findings are consistent with excessive iron deposition in the brain.7 Ten forms of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumula- tion have been identified, and each disorder has been associated with a specific genetic mutation (Table 2).15 Most of these diseases first develop in childhood or adolescence, but a few develop in adulthood.\nAn atypical form, pantothenase kinase\u2013asso- ciated neurodegeneration, is characterized by speech disturbances, psychiatric problems, and extrapyramidal symptoms, and the condition usually occurs in young adults. In addition, the classic finding on MRI is the \u201ceye of the tiger\u201d sign16 \u2014 areas of hyperintensity within a region of hypointensity \u2014 which was not present in this case. Neuroferritinopathy can occur in middle- aged adults. Symptoms include psychosis, anxi- ety, depression, and frontal lobe dysfunction, and motor signs are often present. However, patients with this disorder have low ferritin lev- els, and the ferritin level was elevated in this patient.17 Mitochondrial membrane protein\u2013asso- ciated neurodegeneration can occur in adults and is associated with prominent neuropsychiat- ric symptoms, parkinsonism, and gait disorders.18 In this patient, iron deposition was seen in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus but not in the other affected brain structures, which makes mitochondrial membrane protein\u2013associated neu- rodegeneration unlikely in this case.19\n\nAceruloplasminemia\nAceruloplasminemia is an autosomal recessive disease that is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes ceruloplasmin. In Japan, where the most extensive data are available, the incidence of this mutation is 1 in 2 million nonconsan- guineous marriages.20 In the absence of cerulo- plasmin, ferroxidase does not convert ferrous iron to ferric iron, and iron deposition occurs in various organs.21 The classic clinical triad of ac- eruloplasminemia includes neurologic dysfunc- tion, retinal degeneration, and diabetes mellitus due to iron deposition in the brain, retina, and pancreas, respectively.22 The first sign of disease is often diabetes mellitus, followed by micro- cytic anemia with a low iron level and an elevat- ed ferritin level in serum (Fig. 2).23 Neurologic symptoms include dementia, other neuropsychi- atric symptoms, and motor symptoms. Among people who are homozygous for this mutation (85%), the first neurologic symptom is often cognitive impairment (in 42%). Widespread cor- tical iron deposition sets aceruloplasminemia apart from the other forms of neurodegenera- tion with brain iron accumulation.24 Serum lev- els of iron and total iron-binding capacity are low and the ferritin level is very high. On the basis of this patient\u2019s clinical presentation, history of gradual cognitive decline, imaging findings con- sistent with excessive mineralization, and low serum levels of iron and total iron-binding ca- pacity with a high ferritin level, I think acerulo- plasminemia is the most likely diagnosis in this case. To establish this diagnosis, I would obtain the serum ceruloplasmin level, which I expect would be undetectable, and if so, I would per- form genetic testing to identify mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene.\nDr. Meridale V. Baggett (Medicine): Dr. Roy, what was your clinical impression when you evaluated this patient?\nDr. Alexis Roy (Neurology): Our differential diagnosis was focused on this patient\u2019s acute change in mental status in the context of a sev- eral-year history of gradual cognitive decline, diabetes, and retinopathy. On the basis of the MRI findings and the triad of diabetes, retinal degeneration, and neurologic dysfunction, our leading diagnosis was aceruloplasminemia.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sacha Uljon: This patient had a serum cerulo- plasmin level below the lower detection limit of the assay. Because serum ceruloplasmin is pro- duced and secreted in the liver, a common cause of low ceruloplasmin levels is liver disease.25 However, this patient\u2019s levels of liver enzymes and albumin were normal. Low ceruloplasmin levels can also result from nutritional deficien- cies such as copper deficiency.26 Indeed, labora- tory testing showed an undetectable serum copper level. However, patients with a low ceru- loplasmin level due to copper deficiency would typically present with neutropenia and anemia,which were not observed in this case.\nLow serum ceruloplasmin and copper levels are also seen in rare genetic diseases, including diseases of copper metabolism such as Wilson\u2019s disease28 or Menkes disease,29 as well as in pri- mary hereditary aceruloplasminemia. Patients with Wilson\u2019s disease would be expected to have a detectable urinary copper level, which was absent in this case.\nThis patient\u2019s laboratory values were also re- markable for a high ferritin level and low levels of iron and total iron-binding capacity in serum.The transferrin saturation was normal. The absence of functional ceruloplasmin leads to de- rangements in iron efflux and transport, thereby leading to a high ferritin level with paradoxically low levels of iron and total iron-binding capacity.30,31 A diagnosis of hereditary acerulo- plasminemia is consistent with all these labora- tory values.30\nDr. Amel Karaa: A genetic testing panel for neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation was performed. The patient had a compound heterozygous mutation in the ceruloplasmin gene, also known as the ferroxidase or iron (II):oxygen oxidoreductase gene, which led to the following amino acid changes: p.Arg215* and p.Gly195Arg. Parental testing showed that the premature translational stop signal (p.Arg215*) was maternally inherited, whereas the missense mutation replacing a glycine residue with an arginine at codon 195 of the ceruloplasmin pro- tein (p.Gly195Arg) was paternally inherited.",
