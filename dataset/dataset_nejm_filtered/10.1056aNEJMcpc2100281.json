    "Primary Symptom": "An 82-Year-Old Woman with Pain, Swelling, and Ecchymosis of the Left Arm",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Vishwajith Sridharan (Medicine): An 82-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with pain, swelling, and ecchymosis of the left arm.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 4 days before admission, when she awoke from sleep with swelling and discoloration of the skin of the left arm above the elbow. There was no history of trauma to the arm. Over the next 2 days, the swelling and discoloration spread to the elbow and forearm and pain developed. The patient presented to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C, the blood pressure 153/65 mm Hg, the pulse 59 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while she was breathing ambient air. Ecchymosis extended from above the left elbow to the left wrist, and there was pain with palpation of the left forearm. The radial pulse was normal, as was range of motion in the left elbow and wrist. Radiographs of the left forearm showed diffuse osteopenia and degenerative changes of the wrist joint, without fractures or bone lesions. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Ibuprofen was adminis- tered, and the patient was given a shoulder sling for comfort and discharged home. Over the next 2 days, the pain in the left arm worsened and the ecchymosis spread to the left hand and digits. The pain did not abate with the use of ice packs or acetaminophen or with elevation of the arm. The patient presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient reported pain in the left arm that occurred with supination or while she was making a fist. There was no numbness or tingling in the arm or hand or history of hemarthrosis, prolonged bleeding with dental procedures, or menorrhagia. The medical history was notable for hyperten- sion, dyslipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery stenosis, osteoporosis, chronic kidney disease, and obesity, as well as an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier. Medications included aspirin, ator- vastatin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and meto- prolol. The patient had smoked tobacco for 40 years but had quit 22 years earlier. She did not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs. She was wid- owed and lived alone but visited with her grown children regularly. Her father had had coronary artery disease.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 169/77 mm Hg, the pulse 76 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 72.5 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 32.3. There was discoloration of the left arm with sharp demarcation in the middle of the upper arm, proximal to the elbow, and uniform extension to the metacarpophalan- geal joints (Fig. 1). There was tenderness with palpation of the forearm and dorsal wrist, passive range of motion of the wrist and elbow, and dif- fuse swelling and mild firmness of the forearm, without induration. Sensation to light touch was intact throughout the arm and hand. The radial pulse was normal, and the fingers were warm, with brisk capillary refill in all the digits. The remainder of the physical examination was nor- mal. Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of kidney- and liver- function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr.  Patrick D.  Sutphin:  Computed tomography\n(CT) of the left arm, performed after the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, revealed disproportionate enlargement of the brachiora- dialis muscle, a finding suggestive of intramus- cular hematoma. There was hyperdense stranding in the subcutaneous fat centered over the elbow and forearm, a finding consistent with hemorrhage (Fig. 2). CT angiography of the ar- teries revealed heavy, partially calcified plaque throughout the thoracic aorta. Focal heavy plaque in the left subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral artery resulted in approximately 70 to 80% stenosis (Fig. 3). The arteries in the left arm were otherwise patent. There were no signs of active hemorrhage on arterial or de- layed-phase images or findings that could lead to localization of an arterial injury, such as pseudoaneurysm or dissection. In addition, an enhancing mass was not identified. The visual- ized superficial and deep veins were patent on delayed-phase images.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Kathleen M. Finn: This 82-year-old woman awoke one morning to find a large area of ec- chymosis and swelling above her elbow. Over the next 4 days, the ecchymosis and swelling spread progressively down her arm and pain developed. Imaging studies of the arm revealed hematoma involving the brachioradialis. When I initially read the details of this case, I had more ques- tions than answers: What exactly is ecchymosis \u2014 is it the same thing as a bruise? Also, how does it relate to hematoma, and why would it expand over a 4-day period?\nEcchymosis\nFirst, I confirmed that ecchymosis is the same thing as a bruise. Ecchymosis is subcutaneous extravasation of blood from surrounding vessels. An area of ecchymosis often starts out as flat, circumscribed, and deep purple but can vary in color, depending on skin tone. The color changes over time, as hemoglobin breaks down. Although it is possible that this patient\u2019s ecchymosis had been caused by repeated episodes of minor trauma that she could not recall, the ecchymosis was the same color throughout, which suggests a single event rather than repeated traumatic episodes over time. Could the discoloration be caused by anything else? Actinic purpura (some- times referred to as senile purpura) is a benign condition characterized by the development of ecchymotic macules predominantly on the fore- arms and hands in older patients as a result of sun exposure.1 Photoaging reduces the amount of subcutaneous tissue, thereby making blood vessels more fragile and more likely to rupture from minor trauma. However, actinic purpura usu- ally results in lesions measuring only 1 to 4 cm, so it is unlikely to be the cause of the large area of ecchymosis observed in this patient.\nHematoma\nIs this patient\u2019s ecchymosis related to the brachio- radialis hematoma observed on CT? Hematoma is a collection of blood in the extravascular space. Deep-tissue hematoma is not visible on the skin, but subcutaneous hematoma has a raised profile with surrounding ecchymosis. Muscular hema- toma can be classified as intramuscular, inter- muscular, or mixed.2 Bleeding that results in intramuscular hematoma is contained within the muscle and its fascia. The increased intramuscu- lar pressure leads to swelling and pain, which can progress over a period of days. In contrast, bleeding that results in intermuscular hemato- ma breaks free of the muscle fascia, causing widespread bruising but limited pain because there is less pressure. This patient had both in- creasing pain and a large bruise, which suggests that she probably had mixed hematoma, with both intramuscular and intermuscular bleeding. What caused the mixed hematoma in this patient?\nHematoma can either result from trauma or occur spontaneously.3 Traumatic hematoma, re- lated to sports or other injuries, is more com- mon. Although an 82-year-old could still play sports, this patient did not report participation in sports, and there was no history of a fall or injury. A cause of traumatic hematoma in older patients that should not be overlooked is elder abuse.4 In the United States, 1 in 10 persons older than 60 years of age experiences some form of elder abuse, so it is important for clini- cians to consider and ask about this diagnosis. For the sake of this discussion, I will assume that this issue was raised and the patient re- ported no abuse.\nBecause potential sources of trauma have\nbeen ruled out and imaging studies did not show a muscle abnormality or aneurysm, this patient\u2019s muscular hematoma can be considered spontaneous. The patient had several risk factors for spontaneous muscular hematoma, including older age, female sex, and a history of hyperten- sion, chronic renal insufficiency, and peripheral vascular disease. However, she did not have the most common risk factor, the use of therapeutic anticoagulation.5 She was taking aspirin, but spontaneous hematoma is more commonly as- sociated with the use of warfarin, heparin de- rivatives, and newer direct oral anticoagulant agents.6 In addition, spontaneous muscular he- matoma tends to occur in three muscle groups\n\u2014 the anterior abdominal muscles, posterior abdominal muscles, and gluteal muscles \u2014 be- cause the blood supplies to these groups are susceptible to changes in abdominal pressure, movement, and shearing forces. Therefore, this patient\u2019s spontaneous muscular hematoma is unusual, given the atypical location and the fact that she was not receiving therapeutic anticoag- ulation.\nOf note, the brachioradialis is located in the most lateral part of the arm, which is often af- fected by minor trauma. Also, blood is supplied to the brachioradialis through the radial recurrent artery, a branch of the radial artery with a 180-degree turn. The artery can become tethered at this turn and is subject to tearing, and these mechanics can increase the risk of bleeding.\nHowever, this patient\u2019s hematoma remains unusual in the absence of both trauma and the use of therapeutic anticoagulation. In addition, I am puzzled as to why the bleeding would con- tinue for 4 days and spread down the arm. Even if trauma to the brachioradialis had occurred without the patient\u2019s knowledge, why would a clot not rapidly form?\nPrimary hemostasis, or initial clot formation, involves platelets and blood vessels, and dys- function results in mucocutaneous bleeding with petechiae. Secondary hemostasis, or fibrin-based clot formation, involves clotting factors, and dysfunction may result in hematoma in joints and muscles.7 This patient\u2019s platelets were nor- mal, so I suspect that the ecchymosis and hema- toma were associated with dysfunction of sec- ondary hemostasis and with the prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT).\n\nProlonged Activated Partial-Thromboplastin Time\nThis patient had a normal prothrombin time and a prolonged aPTT. She was 82 years of age and did not have a previous bleeding abnormality, so we can assume that the cause of the prolonged aPTT was acquired rather than inherited. This leaves four possible causes: therapeutic antico- agulation, lupus anticoagulant, acquired von Willebrand factor deficiency, and an acquired inhibitor of factor VIII, IX, XI, or XII. We know that this patient was not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation.\nA prolonged aPTT due to lupus anticoagulant is more frequently associated with clotting than with bleeding. Although the patient had had an episode of deep venous thrombosis 40 years earlier, there had been no recurrence. In addition, although antiphospholipid antibody syndrome can be associated with hemorrhage, I found no reports of an association with spontaneous muscular bleeding. Therefore, the presence of lupus anticoagulant is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\nAlthough von Willebrand factor is involved with primary hemostasis and platelets, it is also a protective carrier of factor VIII, and the von Willebrand factor level correlates directly with the factor VIII level. A prolonged aPTT does not typically develop until the factor VIII level is 20 to 30% of the normal level. If the von Willebrand factor level had been so severely reduced in this case, I would expect to see mucocutaneous bleeding, which this patient did not have. Fur- thermore, acquired von Willebrand factor defi- ciency is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders, and cardiac conditions, none of which were present in this patient.8 Overall, acquired von Willebrand factor deficiency is unlikely to explain this patient\u2019s presentation.\nThe remaining possibility is the presence of\nan acquired inhibitor of factor VIII, IX, XI, or XII. Acquired factor IX deficiency is rare, and case reports typically involve postpartum women.9 Acquired factor XI and XII deficiencies are, per- haps surprisingly, not associated with bleeding. Therefore, acquired factor VIII deficiency is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s prolonged aPTT. This rare form of acquired hemophilia A, due to the development of autoantibodies against factor VIII, manifests over weeks to months.10 The incidence increases with age, with a median age at diagnosis of 78 years. Bleeding can be severe, and intramuscular bleeding can occur. The condition is sometimes associated with can- cer and autoimmune diseases, but more than 50% of cases have an unknown cause. The pres- ence of an acquired factor VIII inhibitor would explain the spontaneous hematoma and the progression of bleeding over a 4-day period and would match the patient\u2019s clinical profile.\nFinally, I should note that this patient pre-\nsented with symptoms suggestive of compart- ment syndrome, which is a surgical emergency, and she would need to be seen by a surgeon immediately. Yet prompt recognition of an ac- quired factor VIII deficiency would be needed, since any surgical intervention would be challeng- ing because of her high risk of bleeding. This is a complicated situation, requiring collaboration with both a surgeon and a hematologist.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Elizabeth M. Van Cott: Diagnostic testing was performed to determine the cause of the unex- plained persistently prolonged aPTT. The first step was to rule out exposure to anticoagulant agents. Heparin may be present even in patients who are not receiving heparin therapy, because specimens are often obtained through a catheter or port flushed with heparinized saline. To test for the presence of heparin, heparinase can be used to remove heparin and then a repeat aPTT can be measured to look for a change. Alterna- tively, the thrombin time can be measured or an anti\u2013factor Xa test can be performed to detect heparin. The thrombin time can also be used to detect argatroban, bivalirudin, and dabigatran anticoagulation. The anti\u2013factor Xa test can also be used to detect rivaroxaban, apixaban,fondaparinux, and low-molecular-weight heparin. In this patient, an anti\u2013factor Xa test was performed and did not detect the presence of these anticoagulants. If an anticoagulant is not present or if the aPTT remains prolonged after heparin is removed, the next step is to perform an aPTT mixing study, which involves mixing patient plasma with normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio and then obtaining the aPTT. A normal aPTT after mixing suggests a deficiency of factor VIII, IX, XI, or XII, since the normal plasma can supply any factor that is missing in the patient plasma. A prolonged aPTT after mixing suggests the presence of an inhibitor, because an inhibitor in the patient plasma would affect the normal plasma, as well. The most common inhibitor is lupus anticoagulant, but rare possibilities in- clude a factor IX or XI inhibitor. The presence of a factor VIII inhibitor is associated with unique results on this test; the aPTT is normal or near normal initially, but after a 2-hour incubation period, the aPTT becomes prolonged again. In this patient, the results of an aPTT mixing study suggested the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor. The patient\u2019s factor VIII level was markedly low, at 4% (reference range, 50 to 200). Other aPTT-based assays for factors IX, XI, and XII had normal results. Causes of an artificially low fac- tor VIII level \u2014 including a clotted specimen, severe von Willebrand factor deficiency, and lu- pus anticoagulant \u2014 were ruled out. The lupus anticoagulant screening assay had a false posi- tive result because of the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor; the confirmatory hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization assay was negative. A chromogenic assay that is not affected by lu- pus anticoagulant revealed a factor VIII level of 1%, providing further evidence that the low fac- tor VIII level was not an artifact associated with\nlupus anticoagulant.\nThe last step is to quantify the factor VIII inhibitor with a Bethesda assay, which involves successively diluting patient plasma until the inhibitor no longer prevents measurement of factor VIII activity. The inhibitor titer is ex- pressed in Bethesda units (BU), which show the amount of inhibitor that neutralizes 50% of the expected factor VIII activity in the assay mixture. In this case, the dilution-activity analysis indi- cated that the patient had an inhibitor titer of\n2.5 BU.\n\n\n",
