    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Akash Gupta (Pediatrics): A 16-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital in au- tumn because of jaundice and abnormal results on liver-function tests.\nThe patient had been well until 4 days before admission, when he noted pruri- tus around his ankles. That night, malaise and mild, intermittent, cramping pain in the right upper quadrant developed. The next day, the patient felt fatigued, his appetite was reduced, and the pruritus became diffuse. Two days before admis- sion, he spent much of the day lying on the couch because of fatigue and malaise; he also reported that food tasted \u201cfunny,\u201d that his urine appeared darker than usual, and that his mother had told him he appeared pale. The day before admis- sion, the patient continued to feel unwell but went to school, where he was told by a teacher that his skin appeared yellow, which prompted him to present to the school nurse. After a discussion with the patient\u2019s mother and pediatrician, the patient was referred to the emergency department at another hospital for evaluation.\nAt the other hospital, the patient reported that his stool had appeared pale gray\nthat day. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 102 beats per minute,  the  blood  pressure  139/82  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  20  breaths  per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The patient did not appear ill but had conjunctival icterus and jaundiced skin. There was no abdominal tenderness, and the remainder of the physical examina- tion was normal. The red-cell indexes and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, amylase, and lipase were normal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis showed clear, amber urine, with a moderate amount of bilirubin, trace albumin, a specific gravity of 1.018, and a pH of 5.5 by dipstick testing. A blood test for heterophile antibodies was negative, as were blood tests for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies, and hepatitis C virus antibodies. After discussion with a pediatric gastro- enterologist, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn arrival, the patient rated his abdominal pain at 6 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had undergone tonsil- lectomy in the remote past. He had never re- ceived a blood transfusion. He took no medica- tions or herbal or dietary supplements and had no known allergies; immunizations were report- edly up to date. The patient lived with his parents and two dogs in a heavily forested, rural area of New England and had not traveled recently. Five days before the onset of illness, he had eaten at a fast-food restaurant. He had had no known expo- sure to sick persons, was not sexually active, and did not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. One year earlier, the patient\u2019s mother had undergone a medical evaluation because of fatigue and jaundice and had been found to have abnormally elevated results of liver-function tests; no specific diagnosis was made, and the illness resolved spontaneously. His maternal grandfather had a history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and brain cancer. A maternal sec- ond cousin had systemic lupus erythematosus.\nOn examination, the patient appeared jaun- diced but not ill. The temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the pulse 80 beats per minute, the blood pressure  134/59  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen  saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 76.5 kg. There was mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant; evaluation for hepa- tomegaly and splenomegaly was limited because the patient was ticklish. The remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. The red- cell indexes, activated partial-thromboplastin time, anion gap, and blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, and acetaminophen were nor- mal, as were the results of renal-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Ta- ble 1. Urinalysis showed clear, amber urine, with 1+ bilirubin, 1+ urobilinogen, a specific gravity of 1.010, and a pH of 6.0 by dipstick testing. Blood was tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA, as well as for Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) antibodies, cytomegalovirus anti- bodies, Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, anti\u2013 smooth muscle antibodies, and anti\u2013liver\u2013kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies.\nDr. Aoife Kilcoyne: Ultrasonography of the ab-\ndomen revealed mild, diffuse heterogeneous echotexture of the liver. No intrahepatic or ex- trahepatic biliary ductal dilatation was noted. The gallbladder was contracted, with no peri- cholecystic f luid. There was no ascites. The spleen was enlarged, measuring up to 16.2 cm in the craniocaudal dimension (normal length,\n<13 cm)1 (Fig. 1). No focal splenic lesions were observed. Doppler evaluation of the upper ab- dominal vasculature was normal.\nDr. Gupta: While the patient was in the emer- gency department, the abdominal pain decreased. Intravenous fluids were administered, and, early the next morning, the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nOn admission, the patient reported mild, dif- fuse pruritus, which was most prominent on the upper back, and mild, diffuse abdominal pain. There was no pharyngeal erythema or exudate and no cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or in- guinal lymphadenopathy; the remainder of the physical examination was unchanged. The patient received treatment with oral ursodiol and vitamin E and intramuscular vitamin K.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Brian K. Alverson: This 16-year-old boy, who has no clinically significant medical history, presents with acute hepatitis, hyperbilirubine- mia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocy- topenia. There are several aspects of his history, findings on physical examination, and labora- tory test results that inform my differential diagnosis.\n\nToxin-Mediated Disease\nIn any previously well adolescent presenting with acute hepatitis and conjugated hyperbiliru- binemia, toxin-mediated diseases must be con- sidered. A normal acetaminophen level does not always rule out the possibility of drug-related toxic effects, since long-term administration can cause hepatitis through reduction of glutathione stores. However, acetaminophen does not cause alteration of cell lines in the complete blood count; therefore, disease resulting from the use of acetaminophen is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\nIn rare cases, severe acute hepatitis can be caused by use of the recreational drug \u201cecstasy\u201d (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine); in this case, it could be caused by ingestion of the wild mushroom Amanita pantherina, given that the patient lives in a wooded area in New England. However, these two toxins, like acetaminophen, do not cause neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.\n\nInherited Disease\nOne important aspect of this case is the family history of liver disease, which suggests the pos- sibility that an inherited condition may be con- tributing to this patient\u2019s illness. The cause of his mother\u2019s hepatitis was never elucidated, and his maternal grandfather reportedly had nonal- coholic fatty liver disease.\nTwo familial conditions \u2014 the Dubin\u2013Johnson syndrome and the Rotor syndrome \u2014 are asso- ciated with intermittent-transient conjugated hy- perbilirubinemia.2 These syndromes are typically benign and manifest with periodic hyperbiliru- binemia but do not manifest with decreased cell counts or with elevated aminotransferase levels. Pruritus is also uncommon in these conditions. Wilson\u2019s disease is an inherited disease that can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and hepatosplenomegaly. However, in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease, hepatitis would not typically resolve spontaneously (as it did in the patient\u2019s mother) and would usually manifest earlier in life; hepatitis is unlikely to be confused with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which was diag- nosed in this patient\u2019s grandfather. Bone mar- row is not affected in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease, so this disease can reasonably be ruled out on the basis of family history and laboratory findings. The ceruloplasmin level was essentially normal; however, ceruloplasmin is an acute- phase reactant and can be normal in patients with Wilson\u2019s disease who also have acute in-\nflammatory disease.3\nAn underlying diagnosis of the MZ phenotype variability in the clinical presentation of HLH, and a rapid diagnosis improves a patient\u2019s prog- nosis; therefore, a high clinical suspicion and early testing is indicated.\nThis patient lives in a wooded area in New England, which raises the possibility of a tick- borne illness. Although antibody testing for\nB.\tburgdorferi was performed, this patient\u2019s pre- sentation is not consistent with Lyme disease, which is typically characterized by rash, facial palsy, meningitis, or heart block, and later, ar- thritis. Testing for Lyme disease should be dis- couraged in cases such as this one, because false positive results are common and can be mislead- ing.8 Furthermore, false positive results are par- ticularly common in the context of acute EBV infection, which remains a possible diagnosis for this patient.\nHuman granulocytic anaplasmosis, which is caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is the sec- ond most common rickettsial infection in the United States and is prevalent in New England.9 This disease is usually less clinically severe than Rocky Mountain spotted fever; however, one third of affected patients require hospitaliza- tion, and death may occur.10 Presentation with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels is typical for human granulocytic anaplasmosis, but signs and symp- toms of the disease can be highly variable. How- ever, this patient has no fever, headache, myal- gia, or arthralgia, all of which are common features of this disease. It would not be unrea- sonable to perform blood nucleic acid testing for anaplasma, and, if there is a delay in definitive diagnosis, it would be prudent to initiate therapy with doxycycline, because a delay in treatment increases the risk of death.10 Rocky Mountain spotted fever may manifest with laboratory find- ings that are similar to those of anaplasmosis; however, affected patients are typically febrile and appear much more ill than this patient, and a majority of patients have a rapidly progressive petechial rash.\nAutoimmune Hepatitis\nIt was appropriate that the physicians caring for this patient were concerned about the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis, which can be associ- ated with aplastic anemia. Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia is the cause of approximately\n \n2 to 5% of cases of childhood aplastic anemia.11 In adults, hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia typically occurs well after the onset of jaundice, but in adolescents, this condition can manifest concurrently. This condition is characterized by acute hepatitis, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and cytopenia. This patient\u2019s remote family his- tory of autoimmune disease, as well as his afe- brile presentation, would be consistent with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. In addition, although autoimmune antibodies are typically detected in the context of autoimmune hepatitis, these tests may be negative in patients with hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Thus, this patient\u2019s normal blood globulin level does not rule out the disease.\nThere are two features of this patient\u2019s presentation that render the diagnosis of hepatitis- associated aplastic anemia unlikely. First, he has splenomegaly, which is probably not due to hepa- tomegaly, given that he has normal abdominal vasculature on ultrasonography. Second, the hemoglobin level is not declining as rapidly as I would expect if this patient had hepatitis-asso- ciated aplastic anemia, although in patients with aplastic anemia, the anemia may manifest lat- er than neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, and the second complete blood count reported in this patient may represent an early downward trend.\n\nCancer\nPatients with hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma may present with findings similar to those seen in this patient, including the absence of lymph- adenopathy and the presence of hepatic abnor- malities and cytopenia.12,13 However, this con- dition is rare and occurs more commonly in immunosuppressed patients than in immuno- competent ones.\nThe most likely diagnosis in this case is acute leukemia. Acute hepatitis without liver failure is a rare but well-recognized manifestation of acute childhood leukemia.14 Patients may present with hepatosplenomegaly and without lymph- adenopathy. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and elevated aminotransferase levels occur in pa- tients who present with jaundice, and typically, patients have low cell counts for multiple cell lines in a complete blood count. Blasts may be scant or absent on a peripheral-blood smear. The\n\n \n\nof alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is the \u201ccarrier state\u201d for the condition, is a consider- ation in this case. Patients are often not asymp- tomatic but are more likely to have hepatitis in the context of concurrent illness (particularly viral hepatitis).4 However, the absence of a fam- ily history of lung disease (e.g., chronic obstruc- tive pulmonary disease or asthma) makes this diagnosis unlikely.5 Although this condition is probably not the underlying problem in this pa- tient, his family may benefit from genetic test- ing for the condition, especially if hepatitis de- velops in additional family members.\n\nInfection\nHepatitis A, B, and C viruses were ruled out by serologic testing; however, several other viruses can cause acute hepatitis, including EBV, cyto- megalovirus, parvovirus, hepatitis E virus, en- terovirus, and adenovirus. Heterophile antibod- ies, which would suggest acute EBV infection, were not detected, but the test for these anti- bodies is often negative early in the course of disease.\nIn addition to causing hepatitis and spleno- megaly, EBV is associated with bone marrow suppression, often through the development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This syndrome results from excessive activation of the immune system and is associated with a variety of underlying genetic mutations. Macro- phages will inappropriately phagocytize other cell lines in the bone marrow, probably through decreased inactivation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes. Because there is no clear single diagnostic test, the diagnosis of HLH is made if a patient meets five of eight clinical criteria; however, some affected patients present with fewer than five criteria.6 This patient met two criteria for HLH \u2014 splenomegaly and low cell counts for two cell lines \u2014 but several labo- ratory criteria were not evaluated. He did not have many findings on physical examination that would be consistent with HLH and EBV in- fection. He had no fever, pharyngitis, or lymph- adenopathy; fever is almost always present in patients with HLH.7 I would obtain a blood sample to measure the ferritin level as an inex- pensive partial workup for HLH. A ferritin level below 500 mg per liter would probably point us away from a diagnosis of HLH. There is great atypical lymphocytes reported by the laboratory at the other hospital may have actually been blasts that were misidentified. To establish the diagnosis of acute leukemia in this patient, I would recommend a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.\n\n",

Wright\u2013Giemsa staining of a peripheral\u2011blood smear (Panel A) shows evidence of pancytopenia, with a small\npopulation of enlarged cells with irregular nuclei, dis\u2011\npersed chromatin, and scant cytoplasm, findings that are morphologically consistent with blasts. On hema\u2011 toxylin and eosin staining of a core biopsy specimen of the bone marrow (Panel B), the specimen is hypercellu\u2011 lar for the patient\u2019s age, with a near absence of normal hematopoietic precursors. Most of the cells seen in the core biopsy specimen and on Wright\u2013Giemsa staining in the aspirate smear (Panel C) are medium in size, with round\u2011to\u2011irregular nuclei, dispersed chromatin, scant cytoplasm, and small nucleoli, findings that are con\u2011 sistent with blasts.\n\nFigure 3. Flow Cytometric Studies of the Bone Marrow Aspirate.\nThe abnormal blast population is shown in gold (Panels A, B, and C) and in blue (Panels D, E, and F). On light\u2011 scatter analysis (Panel A), the blasts have greater forward scatter than normal small lymphocytes (shown in magenta), a finding that is indicative of their larger size relative to normal lymphocytes. The blasts show dim expression of CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) (Panel B); are positive for B\u2011cell markers CD19 and CD20 (Panel C); are positive for CD10 (Panel D); are positive for markers of immaturity, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) (Panel E) and CD34 (Panel F); and lack expression of kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains (not shown).\n\n\nDr. Aliyah R. Sohani: The white-cell differential count obtained on presentation to this hospital showed marked neutropenia, lymphocytic pre- dominance, and 9% blasts (Fig. 2A); these find- ings probably corresponded to the atypical lym- phocyte population noted in the differential count obtained at the other hospital. The pres- ence of blasts was confirmed by means of flow cytometry of the peripheral blood, which identi- fied a small population of B lymphoid blasts that showed dim expression of CD45 and ex- pression of CD19, CD20, CD10, CD34, and ter- minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and which was negative for surface kappa and lamb- da immunoglobulin light chains.\nA bone marrow biopsy and aspiration were\nperformed the next day. The bone marrow core biopsy specimen was highly cellular, with de- creased normal hematopoietic elements. Ap- proximately 95% of the marrow cells consisted of blasts (Fig. 2B and 2C), and f low cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate showed B lym- phoid blasts that were immunophenotypically identical to the circulating blasts (Fig. 3). Bone marrow cytogenetic analysis showed the fol- lowing complex karyotype containing two re- lated clones, each with deletions or rearrange- ments that resulted in loss of the short (p) arm of chromosome 9 in 19 of 20 metaphases: 46,XY,del(9)(p13),i(9)(q10)[cp2]/46,XY,del(3)\n(q21),t(6;9)(q21;p22),i(9)(q10)[cp17]/46,XY[1].  Flu-\norescence in situ hybridization confirmed the loss of chromosome 9p in 92% of interphase nuclei, an abnormality that is reported to be more common among patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have high-risk clinical features than among those with childhood ALL who do not have high-risk clinical features.15 The bone marrow specimen was sent to a reference laboratory; a multiplex reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay did not detect fusions involving ABL1 or other kinase genes that result in an RNA expression profile that is similar to that of B-cell ALL with BCR-ABL1 rearrangement.\n",
