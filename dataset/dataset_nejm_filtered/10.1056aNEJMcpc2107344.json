    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kathy M. Tran: A 33-year-old pregnant woman with ulcerative colitis was admit- ted to this hospital during the summer at 10 weeks of gestation because of fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, and headache.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 days before this admis- sion, when fever, rigors, nausea, and vomiting developed. During the next 3 days, the symptoms worsened; the patient was unable to eat, drink, or take medications. She reported abdominal pain and cramping on the left side that she described as being similar to previous flares of ulcerative colitis; she also had nonbloody diar- rhea. The patient called the obstetrics clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital.\nA review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild headache, neck pain, and photophobia. The patient reported no hematochezia, pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, dysuria, or joint pain. Ulcerative colitis had been diagnosed 11 years earlier; at the time of the diagnosis, she began treatment with azathioprine but stopped after 1 year because of severe fatigue. The patient had taken mesalamine and sulfasalazine intermittently for disease flares but typically stopped after a few months of treat- ment. Exacerbations of ulcerative colitis occurred approximately every year and were associated with fevers, rigors, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea.\nNine months before this admission, Clostridioides difficile colitis developed, and the patient was successfully treated with oral vancomycin. Three weeks before the current admission, she was admitted to this hospital for a flare of ulcerative coli- tis; intravenous methylprednisolone, hydromorphone, and ondansetron were ad- ministered, and mesalamine was restarted. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed mild erythema and friable mucosa with a decreased vascular pattern in the sigmoid colon.\nDr. Craig R. Audin: A transvaginal ultrasound image obtained during that admis- sion showed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks of gestation and trace subchorionic hemorrhage.\nDr. Tran: The patient was discharged after 7 days once most of the symptoms had abated, although nausea persisted. The patient had had two previ- ous successful pregnancies that had resulted in cesarean deliveries at full term. The patient re- ported that she had received all the usual childhood immunizations. Routine prenatal serologic screening during the current pregnancy showed immunity to varicella but not to rubella. Tests for syphilis, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV) were negative. Other history included anemia, chronic back pain, migraines, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety.\nAt the time of the current admission, medica- tions included prednisone, mesalamine, omepra- zole, ondansetron, hydromorphone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, sumatriptan, gabapentin, loraze- pam, sertraline, pyridoxine, cholecalciferol, and prenatal vitamins. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in an urban area of New England with her male partner, with whom she was monogamous, as well as her two chil- dren. She worked as an administrator. She did not eat sushi or rare or raw meat, and she did not consume unpasteurized milk or cheese. She had no known sick contacts or exposure to ani- mals. The patient did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit substances. Her mother had coronary artery disease, her father inflam- matory bowel disease, and her sister depression. Her brother and two children were well.\nOn examination, the temperature was 38.2\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 118/61 mm Hg, the pulse 116 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She appeared tired and uncomfortable. The abdomi- nal examination was remarkable for a healed surgical scar; there was diffuse tenderness that was most painful in the lower quadrants. The remainder of the examination was normal. The hemoglobin level was 7.7 g per deciliter (refer- ence range, 12.0 to 16.0), which was similar to the patient\u2019s baseline level. Urinalysis was nor- mal. Blood specimens were obtained for micro- biologic culture. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Audin: Color Doppler ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed mild fullness in the pelvi- calyceal system on the right side (Fig. 1A) that is probably a physiologic finding in pregnancy. There was trace f luid in the right lower quad- rant; however, the appendix was not visualized (Fig. 1B).\nDr. Tran: Intravenous fluids, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone were administered; mesalamine was continued, and a tapering of the prednisone dose was begun. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evalua- tion and care.\nThe next day, the abdominal pain persisted and was most severe in the right upper and right lower quadrants. The headache had increased in severity; it was pulsating in quality and was worst in the frontal region, with radiation to the occipital region and posterior neck. There was mild photophobia but no neck stiffness or limi- tation in the range of motion in the neck. Em- pirical treatment with intravenous ampicillin\u2013 sulbactam and prophylaxis with oral vancomycin were started.\nOn the third hospital day, the systolic blood pressure declined to 70 mm Hg; after intravenous fluids were administered, the systolic blood pres- sure increased to 100 mm Hg. Ultrasound im- ages of the uterus obtained at the bedside con- firmed a fetal heartbeat. A lumbar puncture was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and colorless, with a glucose level of 63 mg per deciliter (3.5 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]) and a protein level of 17 mg per deciliter (reference range, 5 to 55). There were 0 nucle- ated cells per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed no neutro- phils and very few mononuclear cells; no organ- isms were identified.\nDr. Audin: Three days later, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. 1C through 1F), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a normal gravid uterus. On T2-weighted imaging, there were rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity that were consistent with focal myometrial contractions, as well as a thin band of low signal intensity surrounding the fetus that was consistent with chorioamniotic separation; both of these findings were consid- ered to be normal in the first trimester. The appendix was normal, without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. Although evaluation of the bowel was limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material, the rectum also appeared normal, without obvious signs of active or chronic in- flammation.\n\nFigure 1. Imaging Studies of the Abdomen.\nA color Doppler ultrasound image of the right kidney shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system (Panel A) that is probably a physio\u2011 logic finding in a pregnant woman. A sagittal color Doppler ultrasound image of the right lower quadrant (Panel B) shows trace fluid; however, the appendix is not visualized. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reveals a normal gravid uterus. A sagittal T2\u2011weighted single\u2011shot fast spin\u2013echo (SSFSE) image of the uterus (Panel C) shows rounded areas of myometrial thickening with low signal intensity (arrow) that are consistent with focal myometrial contractions. A heavily windowed coronal T2\u2011weighted SSFSE image of the uterus (Panel D) shows a thin band of low signal intensity (arrows) surround\u2011 ing the fetus that is consistent with chorioamniotic separation, a normal finding in the first trimester. An axial T2\u2011weighted SSFSE image of the abdomen (Panel E) and an axial image of the abdomen obtained with short\u2011tau inversion recovery parameters (Panel F) reveal a normal appendix (Panel E, arrowheads) without wall thickening, dilatation, or adjacent inflammatory changes. The rectum, which can be seen in Panel C, shows no wall thickening, mural stratification, or proliferation of mesorectal fat, although evaluation of the bowel is limited in the absence of oral and intravenous contrast material.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Andrea L. Ciaranello: This 33-year-old pregnant woman presented with fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and tenderness at 10 weeks of gestation. She also reported headache and photophobia, but there was no meningismus on examination. Evaluation of this patient\u2019s symp- toms is challenging because of her recent his- tory of an ulcerative colitis flare 3 weeks before this admission. Among her symptoms, fever has the broadest differential diagnosis; when it oc- curs during pregnancy, it is most likely due to infection. Since infection may have serious com- plications for the mother and fetus, I will focus my differential diagnosis on the potential causes of fever and infection in pregnancy.\nNormal Pregnancy\nFirst, it is helpful to consider a few key aspects of normal pregnancy and how they relate to conditions that might cause fever and infection. By 10 weeks of gestation, the placenta weighs approximately 50 g, and the vascular connection with maternal circulation is well established.1 Thus, organisms with known tropism for pla- cental tissue should be considered in this pa- tient. Although the immunologic changes that occur during pregnancy are incompletely under- stood, it is thought that a shift from type 1 helper T (Th1) cell\u2013predominant immune re- sponses (promoting cell-mediated immunity) to type 2 helper T (Th2) cell\u2013predominant respons- es (promoting allergic response and antibody mediated immunity) may occur, and this can increase the risk of infection with intracellular pathogens.2 Infection in pregnancy can be easily missed, because many features of normal preg- nancy mimic those of early infection. These in- clude reductions in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure, a lower albumin level and mild leukocytosis, and a progesterone-mediated increase in respiratory rate that can lead to re- spiratory alkalosis with compensatory renal ex- cretion of bicarbonate. These same physiologic changes also confer a predisposition to rapid clinical deterioration in pregnant women with severe infection; therefore, it is important for clinicians to have a low threshold for suspecting and treating presumed sepsis in pregnant wom- en.3 However, most of these physiologic changes occur late in the third trimester, and although they are important to consider when caring for patients near full term, they are unlikely to affect this patient, who presented during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nFever during Pregnancy\nIn addition to common causes of fever that should be considered in association with this patient\u2019s symptoms, it is helpful to outline broad categories of infections to rule out when evaluat- ing fever in a pregnant woman. These include infections that may lead to severe complications in the fetus or infant (TORCH infections [de- scribed below], malaria, listeriosis, and acute HIV infection); infections that may lead to severe complications in the pregnant woman (malaria, hepatitis E virus infection, influenza, primary herpes simplex virus [HSV] infection, measles, varicella\u2013zoster virus [VZV] infection, and se- vere bacterial infection); infections leading to complications to which pregnant women are more susceptible than other patients (malaria, listeriosis, and perhaps acute HIV infection); or conditions that are likely to cause infection in a specific host, such as ulcerative colitis and\nC. difficile infection in this patient, given her history of these conditions.\nThe patient had not traveled outside the United States in many years, so we can probably rule out malaria and hepatitis E. In addition, we have very helpful radiographic data obtained dur- ing her current illness, including findings from abdominal MRI, which had been performed to better evaluate the appendix, since the appendix had not been well visualized on ultrasonogra- phy. The absence of visualized colitis makes a flare of ulcerative colitis or recurrence of severe\nC. difficile infection unlikely.\n\nTORCH Infections\nThe acronym TORCH stands for toxoplasmosis, \u201cother\u201d (including syphilis, Zika virus infection, parvovirus B19 infection, and VZV infection), rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and HSV infection. Zika virus infection, rubella, VZV infection, and toxoplasmosis are rare among pregnant women in the United States, with inci- dences of less than 0.2 cases per 1000 pregnan- cies.4-7 Although syphilis and toxoplasmosis oc- casionally cause hepatitis during pregnancy, neither of these infections usually causes ab- dominal pain and diarrhea. Primary HSV infec- tion is common in pregnancy, and pregnant women are at risk for HSV-associated hepatitis; however, HSV infection rarely leads to diarrhea and would be unlikely to occur in the absence of a rash.8 Among the TORCH infections, parvo- virus B19 infection (with an incidence of 30 to 160 cases per 1000 pregnancies)9,10 and CMV infection (with an incidence of 20 to 240 cases per 1000 pregnancies)11 remain as possible causes of this patient\u2019s symptoms.\nParvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum,\nwhich is associated with the classic \u201cslapped- cheek\u201d rash in children. In adults, it is associ- ated with fever, coryza, and headache. Pure red- cell aplasia is usually limited to patients with underlying hemoglobinopathies. Although ar- thralgia is rarely seen in patients with parvovi- rus infection (reported in <10% of affected adult patients), gastrointestinal symptoms are com- mon (with nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea occur- ring in up to 40% of affected patients). Parvovi- rus B19 infection in pregnancy is not associated with impaired embryogenesis, but it confers a risk of fetal anemia and thrombocytopenia, high-output heart failure (hydrops fetalis), and intrauterine fetal demise.12\nCMV infection is common in pregnancy. Al-\nthough the seroprevalence is high in many U.S. patient populations, the incidence of primary infection among nonimmune pregnant women ranges from 2.3% in the general U.S. population to 8.5% (in day-care providers) and 24% (in parents of children shedding CMV in urine or saliva).11 In adults, including pregnant women, CMV infection is often asymptomatic or causes a mild fe- brile illness. CMV mononucleosis causes pharyn- gitis, myalgia, and fatigue, with a more prolonged fever course and less prominent lymphadenopa- thy than those usually seen with Epstein\u2013Barr virus mononucleosis. In patients with inflam- matory bowel disease, symptomatic colitis flares that do not respond as expected to antiinflam- matory therapy have sometimes been attributed to CMV infection, on the basis of biopsy speci- mens of the colon that show CMV and when there is a clinical response to ganciclovir.13 The absence of evidence of colitis on abdominal im- aging does not support this entity in this patient; even if colitis had been present, data are lacking to determine the effect of inflammatory bowel disease\u2013associated CMV colitis on the fetus. CMV infection in pregnancy is important to consider, because a confirmed CMV infection can lead to a wide range of fetal outcomes, rang- ing from no symptoms to a severe sepsislike syndrome or long-term neurologic impairment. In addition, maternal CMV infection during preg- nancy is the leading nongenetic cause of hearing loss worldwide. Although immediate neonatal therapy with ganciclovir can improve outcomes in infants, antenatal treatment options are extreme- ly limited, and counseling about the prevention of CMV infection in pregnancy is critical.\nAcute HIV Infection\nIt is important to consider acute HIV infection when any acute febrile illness is present. Although diarrhea may be associated with acute retroviral syndrome, more common symptoms include fe- ver, rash, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy.14 It is critical to rule out acute infection in pregnant women, because they may be at a higher risk for acquiring HIV infection than nonpregnant women, and acute infection that occurs during pregnancy or breast-feeding confers a high risk of transmission to the fetus or infant.\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nThis patient presented for care before the pan- demic of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Had she presented during the Covid-19 pan- demic, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) would be important to consider in a patient with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. We lack sufficient data to understand whether pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than nonpregnant women, as is seen with influenza and other severe coronavirus infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavi- rus 1.15 Although data from early in 2020 sug- gested that clinical outcomes were not more severe during pregnancy, more recent reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention suggest that hospitalized pregnant women may be more likely than hospitalized nonpregnant women to be admitted to an inten- sive care unit and to receive mechanical ventila- tion.16,17 Data on fetal outcomes are still being assessed; the literature includes only limited data on outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infections that occur early in pregnancy and after mild or asymp- tomatic infection. Existing data have not sug- gested teratogenicity but may suggest increased risk of stillbirth and preterm delivery, and true in utero transmission is rare.18 Messenger RNA vaccines for Covid-19 have not been associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy out- comes, generate high antibody levels in mater- nal blood and breast milk, and lead to efficient transplacental antibody transfer to fetuses.19\nInfluenza\nInfluenza remains a substantial cause of death and complications among pregnant women, with an increased risk of severe disease later in preg- nancy. Vaccination of women who will be at any stage of pregnancy during influenza season pro- vides protection both against severe maternal ill- ness and against infection in newborns, who re- ceive passive antibody protection until they can be vaccinated at 6 months of age. Although a syndrome of fever, vomiting, and diarrhea is con- sistent with influenza, this patient\u2019s presentation in the summer makes influenza unlikely.20\n\nMeasles\nGiven the rising rates of vaccine refusal in the United States and worldwide, measles must again be on the differential diagnosis for fever in preg- nancy. Pregnancy increases the risk of severe measles-related illness, including pneumonia and encephalitis, and death. Although measles is not associated with birth defects, its presence dur- ing pregnancy can cause miscarriage or still- birth, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. This patient reported receiving the usual childhood vaccinations but could not recall or provide specific documentation of measles vaccination; her serologic test for rubella was negative. Sero- logic testing for rubella, but not for measles, is a part of our routine antenatal evaluation. Although the presence of rubella IgG would suggest receipt of at least one dose of the measles\u2013mumps\u2013 rubella vaccine for patients born in the United States, it has not been validated as a surrogate marker of measles immunity. Gastroenteritis can occur with measles, usually during the phase in which both rash and fever appear; the absence of rash in this patient makes measles unlikely.21\n\nSevere Bacterial Infections\nSepsis is the second leading cause of maternal death in the United States.22 Peripartum sepsis is also associated with an increased risk of miscar- riage, stillbirth, and preterm delivery.3,23 The most common sites of infection are the kidneys (pyelonephritis), the lungs (pneumonia), and the uterus (chorioamnionitis, infection caused by retained products of conception, and postpar- tum endometritis). Infection with the most com- mon bacterial pathogens depends on the site and timing of illness: infection with Escherichia coli is most common before delivery; infections with group B streptococcus, E. coli, and anaerobes occur most commonly during the intrapartum stage; and infections with these same organisms plus group A streptococcus and staphylococcus are most common during the postpartum period. Although any of these pathogens can cause sep- sis in pregnant women, infection with Listeria monocytogenes is of particular concern in this patient because of her fever, headache, photo- phobia, and gastrointestinal symptoms.\nListeria monocytogenes\nThis patient\u2019s presentation has several key fea- tures that are consistent with listeria infection. In an immunocompetent host, ingestion of food contaminated with listeria typically results in asymptomatic infection or mild febrile gastroen- teritis.24 However, this patient is at increased risk for invasive listeria infection because she is preg- nant, has an inflammatory bowel disease, and takes immunosuppressive therapy.25 Listeria has a unique mechanism of cell-to-cell spread that allows the organism to breach the intestinal epithelial barrier and enter the bloodstream, where it can subsequently cross the blood\u2013brain barrier to cause meningoencephalitis in elderly or immunocompromised people or cross the placental barrier to cause fetal infection in preg- nant women (Fig. 2).\nListeria infection is usually mild in pregnancy. Approximately half of pregnant women with listeriosis have bacteremia, but central nervous system (CNS) involvement, such as rhomben- cephalitis seen in immunocompromised patients, is rare.26 Approximately two thirds of pregnant women with listeria infection have symptoms; the most common are fever, influenza-like ill- ness, abdominal pain, headache, and vomiting or diarrhea.28 Although listeria infection in preg- nant women is usually mild, fetal and infant infections can be severe. The risk of miscarriage or stillbirth is approximately 20%. Among liveborn infants, preterm delivery is common, and approximately two thirds will have symptoms at birth, such as bacteremia, pneumonia, meningi- tis, or maculopapular rash. Abscesses or granu- lomas in the skin, liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, or brain can characterize the syndrome of granulomatosis infantiseptica, which often leads to stillbirth or neonatal death. In a minority of infants who appear asymptomatic at birth, disease \u2014 including bacteremia or meningitis \u2014 will develop after 5 days of life. Although the risk of symptomatic listeria infection increases later in pregnancy, the risk of a serious adverse fetal outcome appears to be greatest when infection occurs early in pregnancy.29\nAntibiotic therapy for listeria infection differs slightly for pregnant women and nonpregnant patients and depends on the clinical presenta- tion. Isolated gastroenteritis in nonpregnant pa- tients younger than 65 years of age without im- munocompromise does not always warrant the use of antibiotic agents. In contrast, in pregnancy, treatment of gastroenteritis is recommended to prevent bacteremia and placental infection. In nonpregnant patients, bacteremia is often treat- ed with two antibiotics to prevent CNS seeding, whereas in pregnant women, given that CNS disease is rare in pregnancy, bacteremia is typi- cally treated with a single drug. Many experts recommend that pregnant women with listeria infection delay delivery as long as possible to maximize the duration of antenatal antibiotic therapy; this approach differs from that used for other forms of bacterial chorioamnionitis, in which prompt delivery is often indicated.26,30\nThe risk of symptomatic listeria infection increases over the course of pregnancy, which makes such an infection somewhat unlikely in a patient at 10 weeks of gestation.29 However, given this patient\u2019s predominant gastrointestinal symptoms and the lack of clear evidence for another cause, listeria infection is the most likely diagnosis in this case.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Melis N. Anahtar: Blood cultures were obtained at the time of admission. After 24 hours of incu- bation, microbial growth was detected in an anaerobic blood-culture bottle, with subsequent growth in four additional aerobic and anaerobic bottles. A Gram\u2019s stain of the blood-culture broth (Fig. 3A) revealed gram-positive bacilli. The bacilli, which were straight and of small to medium size and occurred either singly or in pairs, were suggestive of listeria species, as op- posed to corynebacterium species, which tend to appear as pleomorphic and club-shaped rods, or bacillus species, which appear as large and box-shaped rods. The blood-culture broth was subcultured on a blood agar plate (Fig. 3B); the resulting grayish colonies were surrounded by a narrow zone of hemolysis. The organism pro- duced catalase and was motile. An isolated colony was identified as L. monocytogenes by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time- of-flight mass spectrometry. Susceptibility to ampicillin and penicillin were confirmed with the use of a broth microdilution panel.\nBecause L. monocytogenes is associated with\nsubstantial mortality in immunocompromised and pregnant women, many countries, including the United States, conduct real-time outbreak monitoring by means of whole-genome sequenc- ing of L. monocytogenes isolates.31 Routine whole- genome sequencing of the isolate from this pa- tient did not reveal links to any other cases, and the source of her infection remains unknown. Routine stool culture to detect L. monocytogenes has both poor sensitivity and poor specificity and was not performed in this patient.\n",
