    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Philippe-Antoine Bilodeau (Medicine): A 21-year-old man presented to this hospital with a sore throat, epistaxis, and petechiae of the oropharynx.\nOne week before the current presentation, blood-filled blisters developed inside the patient\u2019s mouth, on the buccal mucosa. He had occasional bleeding from the mouth that resolved spontaneously. He consulted with his dentist, who was concerned about the possibility of impacted wisdom teeth. Two days before the current presentation, a sore throat developed. There was no difficulty with swal- lowing. On the day of the current presentation, epistaxis developed and did not resolve over a period of 2 hours.\nThe patient presented to another hospital for evaluation. On examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the blood pressure 142/76 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was breathing ambient air. He had blood in the nares and petechiae on the soft palate. There was a large ecchymosis on the left forearm that the patient attributed to carrying heavy boxes several days earlier. The remainder of the ex- amination was normal. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5), a platelet count of 1000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 450,000), and a white-cell count of 670 per microliter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000). The absolute neutrophil count was 50 per micro- liter (reference range, 1800 to 7000). Blood levels of electrolytes and glucose were normal, as were results of tests for coagulation, renal function, and liver function. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The nose was packed to control the bleeding, and 1 unit of platelets was transfused. The patient was transferred to this hospital for additional evaluation and treatment.\nIn the emergency department of this hospital, the patient reported a mild sore\nthroat but no other symptoms; epistaxis had resolved with nasal packing. There was no fever, weight loss, rash, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The patient had a history of sickle cell trait. He took no medications and had no known allergies. He had been living with his parents and younger brother since he had left his college campus at the start of the coronavirus dis- ease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. He worked in a grocery store, and his only known sick contact was his mother, who had been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 months earlier. She had been isolated in a room in their home during her ill- ness. The patient did not have any symptoms associated with Covid-19 and had never been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. His father and brother had been well. The family lived adjacent to a wooded region, and the patient had been hiking in northern New England 2 months before the current presentation. He had not noticed any tick bites. He had no animal contacts. The pa- tient was born in Central America and had moved to a suburban region of New England at 3 years of age. He had previously traveled to Mexico and Canada. He was sexually active with female partners only. He did not smoke tobacco, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. His father had hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and paternal family members had sickle cell disease.\nOn examination, the patient appeared  well.\nThere were petechiae on the soft palate (Fig. 1). There was no scleral icterus, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly. A large ecchymosis was present on the left forearm. The remainder of the examination was normal. Blood levels of folate and cobalamin were normal, as were results of serum protein electrophoresis and the ratio of free kappa to lambda light chains. Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A radio- graph of the chest and an ultrasound image of the upper abdomen were normal, without sple- nomegaly. Testing of a specimen obtained from the nasopharynx was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA; the patient was admitted to the hospital and placed in enhanced isolation. Examination of thick and thin peripheral-blood smears for babesia was negative.\nA second unit of platelets was transfused, and a diagnostic test was performed.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Hanno Hock: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the diagnosis. This 21-year-old man had been in excellent health until the week of admission, when oropharyn- geal and cutaneous bleeding developed. On pre- sentation, the severely decreased platelet count explained the bleeding. The very low total white- cell count and absolute neutrophil count indi- cated that he was at risk of infection. The only moderately decreased hematocrit suggested that he did not have long-standing severe anemia, but the absence of reticulocytes showed that red- cell production was profoundly impaired. Because he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, could this patient\u2019s cytopenias be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection?\nPatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and an\nacute febrile illness often have blood abnormali- ties such as pancytopenia,1-3 which are some- times triggered by hemophagocytic lymphohis- tiocytosis.4,5 However, this patient did not have a febrile illness. In the absence of illness, his positive SARS-CoV-2 test could be indicative of the presymptomatic incubation period of SARS- CoV-2 infection, asymptomatic active infection, or shedding of RNA after asymptomatic infec- tion. However, none of these circumstances have been associated with major blood abnormalities. Therefore, we needed to consider the wide spec- trum of causes of pancytopenia.\n\nSickle Cell Trait\nThis patient did not use medications, illicit drugs, or alcohol and had normal levels of vitamin B6 and vitamin B12. These features rule out several common causes of cytopenia. Patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for aplastic crisis, which is an acute decrease in the red-cell count that often occurs after parvovirus B19 infection.6 This patient was a carrier of sickle cell trait but was not at risk for the major complications of sickle cell disease.7 Although sickle cell trait is as- sociated with some health risks8 and should be considered as a potential factor contributing to poor outcomes among Black patients with Covid- 19,9 it has not been linked to pancytopenia.7\n\nIncreased Cell Destruction\nPancytopenia can result from several conditions that cause increased cell destruction. Cells may pool in an enlarged spleen or be destroyed by the splenic reticuloendothelial system, but this patient did not have splenomegaly. Evans syn- drome \u2014 a combination of immune thrombocy- topenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and immune neutropenia \u2014 causes pancytope- nia from peripheral destruction.10 Immune throm- bocytopenic purpura has recently been reported in association with Covid-19.4 However, this pa- tient did not have evidence of hemolysis or com- pensatory reticulocytosis, which would be ex- pected in a patient with Evans syndrome. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can be trig- gered by numerous infectious agents other than SARS-CoV-2, including Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus,5 but this patient did not have signs of infection or inflammation.\n\nDecreased Cell Production\nInfection can impair cell production through various mechanisms.11,12 Parvovirus B19,13 hepa- titis C virus,14 human herpesvirus 6,15 human herpesvirus 7,16 cytomegalovirus,17 and the hu- man immunodeficiency virus (HIV)18 can directly infect hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. Cytomegalovirus, HIV, and coxsackievirus B can infect bone marrow stromal cells and sup- press cell production,11 but this usually occurs in patients who have a chronic condition, take an immunosuppressive medication, or have overt signs of infection. Many pathogens suppress cell production indirectly, through cytokine release and inflammation.11 Respiratory viruses such as influenza A, influenza B, rhinovirus, and SARS- CoV-2 can cause transient cytopenias in ill pa- tients, but this patient did not have a fever and was otherwise well.1,19\nCancer\nLymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and myelodys- plastic syndromes can cause pancytopenia by replacing normal hematopoietic stem cells with malignant cells. Leukemia can be aleukemic, without leukemic blasts in the blood. The pre- sentation of myelodysplastic syndromes in chil- dren and young adults may be different from that in older adults; younger patients more often have hypocellular bone marrow, which makes it harder to differentiate the condition from aplas- tic anemia.20-23 In addition, paroxysmal noctur- nal hemoglobinuria, a clonal disorder that ini- tially manifests as hemolytic anemia because of complement-mediated destruction, may cause pancytopenia in the late stages.24 However, the absence of constitutional symptoms, sudden onset of bleeding, and nearly complete absence of cell production made cancer and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria unlikely diagnoses in this case.\n\nAplastic Anemia\nAplastic anemia is characterized by pancytope- nia and the loss of hematopoietic stem cells, progenitor cells, and precursor cells in the bone marrow.25,26 It was the most likely diagnosis in this previously healthy patient with pancytopenia in the absence of constitutional symptoms and abnormal cells. Aplastic anemia results from one of three main mechanisms25: damage by extrin- sic factors, manifestations of familial genetic mutations, and autoimmune attack on hemato- poietic stem cells and progenitor cells.\nExtrinsic causes of aplastic anemia are usu- ally obvious and include major accidental or therapeutic exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, or massive exposure to benzene25 or pesticides such as organochlorines and organophosphates.27 Several medications have been infrequently as- sociated with aplastic anemia.27,28 However, this patient was not taking any medications and had no known chemical or radiation exposures.\nThe genetic disorder most commonly associ- ated with aplastic anemia is Fanconi\u2019s anemia, a DNA repair defect that results from a mutation in 1 of at least 15 known genes.29 Patients with Fanconi\u2019s anemia typically have bone marrow failure in the first or second decade of life, as well as other congenital abnormalities, includ- ing thumb and facial deformities and short stature.29 The second most common genetic cause of bone marrow failure is dyskeratosis congenita, which is due to mutations in genes involved in telomere repair or protection.30 Dys- keratosis congenita typically manifests in child- hood with skin pigmentation abnormalities, oral leukoplakia, and dystrophic nails. However, the disease may cause isolated bone marrow fail- ure.31 Finally, GATA2 mutations have emerged as a potential genetic cause of aplastic anemia.32 These mutations are associated with other man- ifestations, including lymphedema, generalized warts from human papillomavirus infection, and mycobacterial infection.23 This patient\u2019s pancyto- penia was unlikely to be caused by a congenital genetic abnormality because he had no family history of such a condition and no associated signs or symptoms.\nUp to 70% of cases of aplastic anemia occur sporadically, resulting from the sudden onset of T-cell\u2013mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells.28 Most cases of aplastic anemia are designated as idiopathic because the triggers for the immune attack on hematopoiesis are obscure. There are known associations with thymoma33 and eosinophilic fasciitis.34 However, both these diseases develop predominantly in the seventh decade of life, and this patient did not have the widened mediasti- num on chest radiography that is suggestive of thymoma or the dimpled skin thickening (peau d\u2019orange change) that is suggestive of eosino- philic fasciitis.34\nThe most common known trigger for aplastic\nanemia is seronegative hepatitis, which precedes 5 to 10% of cases of aplastic anemia by ap- proximately 2 to 3 months.35,36 The median age at the onset of hepatitis-associated aplastic ane- mia is 20 years, but this patient\u2019s history did not suggest recent hepatitis. Aplastic anemia is also thought to occur after infection with common hepatitis viruses37 and other viruses, including HIV and parvovirus B19,12,38,39 but at a much lower frequency than with seronegative hepatitis.\nIt is intriguing that this patient\u2019s exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and probable asymptomatic infec- tion occurred 2 months before his presentation, an interval similar to that between the onset of seronegative hepatitis and the development of aplastic anemia; therefore, it is tempting to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 infection may have been a trigger. However, his presentation and age also fit with idiopathic aplastic anemia, which has an incidence of 2 to 3 cases per 1 mil- lion per year.27 Given the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic, a potential association may eventu- ally be confirmed if the incidence of aplastic anemia rises. Regardless of the trigger, this pa- tient\u2019s presentation and blood abnormalities were highly suggestive of aplastic anemia, a diagnosis that must be confirmed with evidence of mark- edly reduced hematopoiesis in a bone marrow\u2013 biopsy specimen. The severity of aplastic anemia is determined by the degree of the associated peripheral-blood cytopenias.28,40,41 The near ab- sence of platelets, neutrophils, and reticulocytes in this case was associated with a high risk of death and a very low chance of recovery without urgent treatment and consideration of bone marrow transplantation.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Lucas R. Massoth: Examination of a peripheral- blood smear confirmed the presence of severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Most of the white cells were lymphocytes, including plasma- cytoid forms, and there were rare plasma cells (Fig. 2A). The neutrophils were morphologically normal. Results of f low cytometric studies of the peripheral blood, including tests for parox- ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and telomere length analysis, were unremarkable.\nAn aspirate and a core biopsy specimen of the bone marrow were obtained. The aspirate was paucicellular and composed of peripheral-blood elements. The core biopsy specimen (Fig. 2B and 2C) showed markedly hypocellular marrow (<5% cellularity) for the patient\u2019s age and was composed mainly of lymphocytes and plasma cells.Maturing hematopoietic elements were rare, and reticulin fibrosis was absent. Immunohistochem- ical stains used to detect proteins expressed by herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, cytomegalo- virus, and parvovirus B19 were negative. Chromogenic in situ hybridization studies used to detect RNA of Epstein\u2013Barr virus and SARS-CoV-242 (Fig. 2D) were also negative.\nFlow cytometric studies of the bone marrow aspirate showed no abnormal lymphoid or myelo- blast population. Cytogenetic studies failed to obtain metaphases for analysis, most likely be- cause of low specimen cellularity. Targeted next- generation sequencing was negative for mutations commonly associated with hematologic cancer, including predisposing germline variants.\nThe overall findings of pancytopenia and se- vere trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia were most consistent with a diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia. Although circulating plasmacy- toid lymphocytes and plasma cells are not char- acteristic of aplastic anemia, their presence has been documented after various infections, in- cluding SARS-CoV-2 infection.43 The absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA on in situ hybrid- ization argues against the possibility that intra- medullary infection had led to bone marrow injury.\n\nFigure 2. Peripheral-Blood and Bone Marrow Specimens.\nWright\u2013Giemsa staining of a peripheral\u2011blood smear (Panel A) shows a circulating plasmacytoid lymphocyte; plate\u2011 lets are notably absent, a finding consistent with thrombocytopenia. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of bone marrow (Panel B) shows markedly hypocellular marrow. At higher magnification (Panel C), the residual cellularity is com\u2011 posed mainly of lymphocytes (arrowhead) and plasma cells (arrow). In situ hybridization of bone marrow to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Panel D) is negative, without the red chromogen staining that in\u2011 dicates the presence of viral RNA; the inset shows an example of positive cellular staining in human lung tissue.\n\n",
