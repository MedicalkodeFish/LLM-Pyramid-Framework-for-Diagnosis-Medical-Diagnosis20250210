    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Neil D. Fernandes: A 29-month-old boy was transferred to this hospital because of a seizure and hypocalcemia.\nApproximately 2 months before the current evaluation, the patient had a febrile seizure associated with an acute viral illness. After the seizure, his mother re- ported that his \u201cwaddling\u201d gait had become more pronounced. Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient was seen in the orthopedic clinic at another hospital. On examination, the cover-up test \u2014 in which the distal lower leg is covered and the alignment of the proximal lower leg is compared with that of the upper leg \u2014 was negative, a finding consistent with physiologic bowing of the leg. There was a pes planus (flatfoot) deformity that resolved when the patient was not bearing weight on the foot, and there was an external (positive) foot progression angle with ambulation. The mother was counseled that the findings were within the normal range for gait and musculoskeletal development. One day before the current evaluation, the mother noticed that the child\u2019s legs \u201clocked up\u201d and appeared \u201cshaky\u201d when he was walking over a threshold.\nOn the morning of the current evaluation, the patient\u2019s mother noticed that the child was grunting while sleeping, with his eyes rolled upward and his arms stiff- ened and flexed. After less than 1 minute, the grunting and movements stopped and the patient vomited. Emergency medical services were called, and the patient was transported to the emergency department of another hospital. Vital signs, mental status, and findings on physical examination were reportedly normal. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a blood calcium level of 5.0 mg per deciliter (1.25 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.5 to 10.5 mg per deciliter [2.12 to 2.62 mmol per liter]). Intravenous calcium gluconate was administered. The patient was trans- ferred to the emergency department of this hospital, arriving approximately 18 hours after a presumed seizure.\nFurther history was obtained from the patient\u2019s parents. The patient had been delivered at full term and had reportedly met developmental milestones for his age.\nHis medical history was notable for atopic dermatitis, which had been diagnosed when he was 9 weeks of age, as well as multiple environmental and food allergies. One year earli- er, evaluation by an allergist had revealed elevated levels on IgE tests specific to food allergens (milk, cashews, pistachios, egg whites, almonds, soybeans, chickpeas, green peas, lentils, peanuts, and sesame seeds) and environmental allergens (dogs, cats, and dust mites), although the patient later underwent food challenges to peanuts, le- gumes, almonds, and sesame seeds in an allergy clinic and had no symptoms. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had received diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, epinephrine, and topical betamethasone as needed. He had not received any routine childhood vaccinations be- cause of his parents\u2019 refusal.\nThe patient lived with his mother, father, two\nolder siblings, and dog in New England. Although the mother was a vegetarian, she occasionally included chicken in the patient\u2019s \u201cnatural\u201d and organic diet. The patient\u2019s mother had obsessive\u2013 compulsive disorder and anxiety, and his father had oral allergy syndrome and a history of varus knee deformity in childhood. The patient\u2019s two siblings had atopic dermatitis, environmental allergies, and food allergies. There was no fam- ily history of seizure.\nOn physical examination, the patient appeared well and was alert and interactive. The tempera- ture was 36.9\u00b0C, the height 83.5 cm (3rd percentile for his age), and the weight 12.4 kg (24th percen- tile for his age). The blood pressure was 95/63 mm Hg, the pulse 114 beats per minute, the respira- tory rate 24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Muscle spasms occurred in the arms and legs with passive movement. Chvostek\u2019s sign (contraction of the facial muscles) was not elicited after tapping on the region of the facial nerve anterior to the external auditory canal; Trous- seau\u2019s sign (carpal spasm) was not elicited after exertion of pressure from inflation of a sphygmo- manometer on the upper arm. Muscle power, bulk, tone, and deep-tendon reflexes were normal, as was the remainder of the examination.\nThe blood calcium level was 5.6 mg per decili- ter (1.40 mmol per liter), the ionized calcium level\n0.88\tmmol per liter (reference range, 1.14 to 1.30), and the alkaline phosphatase level 673 U per liter (reference range, 142 to 335). Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was ad- mitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.\n\nDr. Ruth Lim: Radiographs of the knees (Fig. 1A and 1B) showed several abnormalities that af- fected the knees symmetrically. The bones were diffusely radiolucent with thinned cortexes; these features suggest generalized demineralization. No acute or healing fracture was detected. The metaphyses of the distal femur and the proximal tibia had a widened, flared contour bilaterally; in addition, the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphyses showed a beaked (pointed) contour. The zone of provisional calcification \u2014 the area located between the metaphysis and the radiolu- cent primary growth plate (physis), where chon- drocytes are responsible for longitudinal growth of long bones1 \u2014 was frayed in appearance, with focal areas of cupping (concavity). The radiolucent physes were abnormally widened in the distal femur and the proximal tibia bilaterally.\nBecause abnormalities were observed on radiographs of the knees, a previously acquired chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) was reviewed for more information. There were subtle findings, includ- ing flaring and cupping of the metaphysis of the right proximal humerus and mild flaring of the anterior ends of the ribs.\n\nTable 1.

Imaging Studies.\nAnteroposterior radiographs of the knees obtained during the current admission (Panels A and B) show generalized demineralization. The metaphyses throughout both knees show flaring (dashed arrow) and fraying and cupping (arrowhead). There is beaking of the medial aspect of the proximal tibial metaphyses (arrow). The radiolucent physes are widened (aster\u2011 isks). (Abnormalities are marked on the image of the right knee only.) An anteroposterior radiograph of the chest obtained during a previous admission (Panel C) shows subtle flaring and cupping of the right proximal humeral metaphysis (arrow) and mild flaring of the an\u2011 terior ends of the ribs (arrowhead). The imaging find\u2011 ings are characteristic of rickets, with manifestations seen along the metaphyseal side of the physis at the sites of most rapid bone growth (i.e., the knee, anteri\u2011 or ends of the ribs, wrist, proximal humerus, and distal tibia). Failure of mineralization leads to disorganized chondrocyte growth, and hypophosphatemia leads to impaired apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes. The result is widening of the physis and fraying and cup\u2011 ping of the metaphysis. A peripherally inserted central catheter is also present.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Yamini V. Virkud: In this 29-month-old boy with a history of eczema and environmental and food allergies, a febrile seizure had occurred 2 months before the current presentation. Since this seizure, the family had noticed ongoing mild limb and gait abnormalities. On the current presentation, the patient had signs of neuromuscular irritabil- ity or tetany, including leg locking and shaking, in addition to seizures, findings that are all con- sistent with clinically significant hypocalcemia. The presence of this condition was confirmed by low levels of calcium and ionized calcium. A primary question arises from this case: How did such severe hypocalcemia develop in this rela- tively healthy 29-month-old boy?\n\nHypocalcemia\nThe differential diagnosis of hypocalcemia can be divided into causes associated with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and causes associated with depressed PTH levels.2,3 PTH secretion regulates the calcium level and is stimulated by a low blood calcium level.2,4 PTH acts on bones by triggering the release of calci- um and phosphate and acts on the kidneys by triggering the resorption of calcium and excre- tion of phosphate. It also triggers renal produc- tion of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which increases intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. As the blood calcium level rises, PTH production is suppressed. Thus, the appropriate homeostatic response to hypocalcemia is secondary hyper- parathyroidism due to compensatory responses of the calcium\u2013PTH\u2013vitamin D axis.\n\nHypocalcemia and a Low PTH Level\nCauses of hypocalcemia in the context of hypo- parathyroidism can be divided into congenital and acquired causes.5 Congenital causes primar- ily include genetic disorders that result in abnor- mal PTH synthesis, such as familial isolated hypoparathyroidism, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge syndrome), or certain mitochondrial disorders. Acquired causes include infection (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus infection), auto- immune disorders (e.g., autoimmune polyglan- dular syndrome type 1), destruction of the para- thyroid gland after surgery or radiation therapy, and infiltrative causes (e.g., cancer, granuloma, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, or iron or copper depo- sition). In this patient, the PTH level was elevated, so these causes of hypocalcemia can be ruled out.\n\nHypocalcemia and a High PTH Level\nCauses of hypocalcemia in the context of hyper- parathyroidism can be divided into those associ- ated with PTH resistance, those associated with calcium loss, and those associated with poor cal- cium intake or absorption.3 PTH resistance can be due to end-organ resistance to PTH (pseudo- hypoparathyroidism), missense mutations in PTH that affect its function, or hypomagnesemia. The loss of PTH-mediated excretion of phosphorus from the kidneys results in an elevated phospho- rus level; this patient\u2019s slightly low phosphorus level and normal magnesium level rule out PTH resistance.\nCalcium loss can result from a variety of acute and chronic causes.3 Acute diseases such as sep- sis, pancreatitis, tumor lysis syndrome, and re- spiratory alkalosis can result in a low ionized calcium level but would not typically affect the total calcium level. Chronic causes of calcium loss include renal disease, hyperphosphatemia,and osteoblastic metastases. Given this patient\u2019s low phosphorus level and the absence of a supporting history, calcium loss would not ade- quately explain his presentation.\nPoor calcium intake or absorption could explain this patient\u2019s hypocalcemia. A common cause of poor calcium uptake and poor man- agement of calcium homeostasis is deficiency of or resistance to vitamin D.6 The diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency and associated rickets fits perfectly with the patient\u2019s signs and limb ab- normalities and with the development of hypo- calcemia and seizures. He also had poor growth, an elevated PTH level, a low phosphorus level, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, findings that are all consistent with vitamin D deficiency.\n\nVitamin D Deficiency\nVitamin D deficiency can be divided into genet- ic, prenatal or perinatal, and childhood causes.7 Genetic disorders that alter the metabolism of vitamin D include deficiencies in enzymes (25-hydroxylase or 1\u03b1-hydroxylase) and defects in the vitamin D receptor, which cause vitamin D resistance; however, these disorders seem un- likely, given their absence in the family history. Prenatal and perinatal causes include maternal vitamin D deficiency, prematurity, and exclusive breast-feeding without vitamin D supplementa- tion, but this patient\u2019s history does not support these possibilities. Childhood causes include obesity, malabsorption, and low sun exposure, as well as decreased nutritional intake, which seems to be the mostly likely explanation in this patient\u2019s case. He had extensive IgE-mediated food allergies, including allergies to cow\u2019s milk and eggs, resulting in a severely restricted diet. Combined with a mostly vegetarian diet, these restrictions result in a loss of all sources of vita- min D (fish, eggs, and fortified milk). A typical, picky toddler diet may not contain nondairy sources of calcium (beans and green leafy vege- tables), thereby exacerbating the poor calcium absorption caused by vitamin D deficiency. I sus- pect that the most likely diagnosis in this case is vitamin D deficiency due to poor nutrition associated with food allergies and avoidance. To establish this diagnosis, I would obtain a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. William T. Rothwell: The diagnostic test result in this case was the markedly low 25-hydroxyvi- tamin D level of 4 ng per milliliter (10 nmol per liter; age-adjusted normal range, 20 to 80 ng per milliliter [50 to 200 nmol per liter]). Vitamin D deficiency can account for each laboratory ab- normality summarized in Table 2.\nActivated vitamin D increases intestinal calcium absorption, increases calcium resorption from bone, and decreases calcium excretion in urine. It also serves as a negative regulator of PTH. Thus, if sufficient vitamin D substrate had been available in this patient, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D would have been appropriately synthesized, calcium would have been sourced from bone and the diet, phosphate excretion in urine would have decreased, and PTH and alkaline phosphatase levels would have been normal.\nAlthough 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the ac- tive form of the hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be measured if deficiency is suspected. The blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level corresponds with vitamin D intake and activity; the half-life of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is 2 to 3 weeks, as compared with a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. However, the 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D level can vary depending on the patient\u2019s vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and PTH levels. For example, this patient\u2019s 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level was initially low. Seven days after vitamin D repletion was started, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level was high. This finding may be misinterpreted to mean that the\npatient is overly replete with vitamin D, when in fact he remains deficient. Instead, obtaining the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level may be useful for the diagnosis of genetic rickets or in the context of chronic kidney failure, unexplained hypercal- cemia, or hypercalciuria.8\n\nTable 2.
