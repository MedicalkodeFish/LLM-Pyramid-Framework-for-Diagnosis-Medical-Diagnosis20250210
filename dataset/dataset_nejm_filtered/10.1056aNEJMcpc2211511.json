    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Aaron R. Kaufman (Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear): A 31-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of red-    ness of the right eye.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 8 days before the current evaluation, when he noticed an itchy perianal rash and rectal pain. After 2 days, the symptoms did not abate, and he sought evaluation in the urgent care clinic of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported the perianal rash and gradually increasing rectal pain. He had been sexually active with two male partners in the previous month. On examination, the temporal temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 117/84 mm Hg, and the pulse 80 beats per minute. Three scattered, tender, shal- low ulcers and a vesicle were present in the perianal area. No rectal discharge or fissures were seen. Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy was present bilaterally; there was no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. Tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and orthopoxvirus infection were performed. Empirical treatment with valacyclovir was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to await the test results.\nTwo days before the current evaluation, test results were available. The test for HIV types 1 and 2 was nonreactive, as were the tests of urinary and rectal speci- mens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acids. The blood test for treponemal antibodies was positive; the results of rapid plasma reagin (RPR) testing were not yet available. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing of a swab specimen obtained from the perianal vesicle detected the presence of  nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA. Species-specific real-time PCR testing confirmed the presence of mpox virus (MPXV; formerly known as monkeypox virus), clade II. The patient was called and instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital. On evaluation, the patient reported a new rash on his chest, abdomen, and back that was similar to the perianal rash. He reported new fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, and headache. There was no weight loss, sore throat, or cough. Numerous scattered, tender, shallow ulcers were present on the chest, abdo- men, and back, in addition to five tender, um- bilicated pustules and one shallow ulcer in the perianal area (Fig. 1). Treatment with tecoviri- mat was started. The patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up in the sex- ual health clinic of this hospital.\nDuring the next 2 days, the patient took teco- virimat. On the day of the current evaluation, he called the sexual health clinic because of red- ness and throbbing, pressurelike pain of the right eye. He was instructed to return to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn the current evaluation, the patient re- ported that redness and discomfort of the right eye had started after he had been discharged from the emergency department and had increased in severity and become painful during the subsequent 2 days. He rated the pain at 10 on a scale of 0 to 10,  with 10  indicating the most severe pain. He did not have blurry vision, photopho- bia, flashing lights, or floaters. There were no symptoms in the left eye. Since the initiation of antiviral therapy, the fever, chills, and headache had resolved, and the rectal pain had decreased in severity. There was no rhinorrhea or cough.\nThe patient had a history of syphilis, which had occurred 5 years earlier and had been treated with intramuscular penicillin G. Since receiving the diagnosis of mpox, he had learned that syphilis and mpox had been diagnosed in one of his sexual partners from the previous month. Medications included tecovirimat and valacyclovir. There were no known drug aller- gies. The patient lived alone in a suburban area of New England and worked in the food-service industry. He did not smoke cigarettes, drink al- cohol, or use illicit drugs. He did not know his family history.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 36.4\u00b0C. The uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, without a relative afferent pupillary defect, and extraocular movements were full. The intraocular pressure was 16 mm Hg in the right eye and 17 mm Hg in the left eye (nor- mal range, 10 to 21). When proparacaine drops were administered to check the intraocular pressure, the pain in the right eye did not decrease in severity. There was mild tenderness on palpa- tion of the right globe under the closed eyelid. Slit-lamp examination revealed mild meibomian- gland dysfunction in both eyes; there was no eyelid edema or erythema. The right conjunctiva was diffusely injected, with severe bulbar hyper- emia (Fig. 2A). The right caruncle was boggy and erythematous. On eversion of the eyelids, small-to-medium-sized follicles and tarsal con- junctival petechiae were observed on the right lower and upper lids (Fig. 2B and 2C). The left conjunctiva was normal. The cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens appeared normal in both eyes. Dilated funduscopic examination was per- formed. The vitreous, optic nerve, retinal vascu- lature, macula, and periphery appeared normal in both eyes.\nFigure 1. Photographs of the Skin.\nPhotographs of the skin were obtained 2 days before the current presentation. Scattered, tender, shallow ulcers are present on the chest (Panel A), abdomen (Panel B), and back (Panel C). Several tender, umbilicated pustules and a tender, shallow ulcer are present in the perianal area (Panel D).\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Miriam B. Barshak: Severely painful, unilateral acute conjunctivitis with small-to-medium-sized follicles developed in this patient while he was taking tecovirimat for mpox. Severe pain is un- usual in patients with conjunctivitis and sug- gests the possibility of scleritis, keratitis, or uveitis, but a detailed examination revealed no involvement of other anatomical regions of the eye. Follicles are associated with a lymphocytic inflammatory response, which is often seen in patients with conjunctivitis caused by a viral in- fection or chlamydia.\nAcute conjunctivitis is the most common cause of eye redness that leads to medical visits, affecting an estimated 6 million people annu- ally in the United States and accounting for ap- proximately 1% of all primary care visits and 30% of all eye-related emergency department visits.1 In constructing a differential diagnosis, I will consider the noninfectious and infectious causes of acute conjunctivitis, with a particular focus on oculogenital syndromes.\n\nNoninfectious Causes of Acute Conjunctivitis\nAllergic conjunctivitis is the most common cause of acute conjunctivitis, affecting 15 to 40% of the population. It is associated with itching in both eyes, sneezing, and rhinorrhea, but unilateral involvement and severe pain would be very atypical for allergic conjunctivitis.1 Another noninfectious cause is toxic conjunctivitis, which is usually induced by topical ocular medications. Ocular side effects have not been described in association with oral tecovirimat.2,3 Although allergic, toxic, and other types of conjunctivitis need to be considered, infections are the most common cause of medical visits for allergic con- junctivitis.1\n\nBacterial Infections\nBacterial infections cause less than 20% of cases of acute conjunctivitis in adults. Purulent drain- age is suggestive of acute bacterial conjunctivi- tis, but this finding has poor sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis. The combination of crusting of the eyelashes in both eyes, the ab- sence of itching, and the absence of previous episodes of conjunctivitis has a better positive predictive value.4,5 This patient had no history or examination findings of drainage, so acute bac- terial conjunctivitis is unlikely. However, I will consider some types of acute bacterial conjunc- tivitis when reviewing oculogenital syndromes.\n\nViral Infections\nViral infections cause 75 to 80% of cases of acute conjunctivitis in adults. Watery drainage is a classic sign of acute viral conjunctivitis, but the combination of concurrent pharyngitis, preau- ricular lymphadenopathy, and recent contact with another person with eye redness has a bet- ter positive predictive value. Overall, 65 to 90% of cases of acute viral conjunctivitis result from adenovirus infection, which is associated with pharyngoconjunctival fever and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, both of which are associated with periauricular lymphadenopathy. This patient did not have these associated findings, so the likeli- hood of acute adenoviral conjunctivitis is low.1\nHerpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella\u2013 zoster virus (VZV) infections account for less than 10% of cases of acute conjunctivitis. These viral infections typically cause unilateral symp- toms and may be associated with skin lesions on the eyelid, keratitis, or uveitis.1 Acute VZV con- junctivitis is usually associated with infection of the ophthalmic branch (V1) or maxillary  branch\n(V2) of the trigeminal nerve. HSV and VZV infec-\ntions typically abate with valacyclovir therapy, so acute HSV or VZV conjunctivitis is unlikely in this patient.\nEnterovirus infection, measles, mumps, ru- bella, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona- virus 2 infection, Ebola virus disease, mpox, and other viral infections can also cause acute con- junctivitis. To narrow the differential diagnosis in this case, I will integrate the patient\u2019s history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nOculogenital Syndromes\nMany STIs can cause ocular disease. It is there- fore imperative to elicit a thorough history from patients with ocular symptoms to assess the risk of STI acquisition, identify possible symptoms of STIs, and review the diagnosis and treatment of past and current STIs, while recognizing that urogenital testing may not rule out ocular infec- tion. This patient had received intramuscular treatment for syphilis 5 years earlier, was cur- rently being treated for mpox, and had recently had negative testing for other STIs, including HIV infection and urogenital gonorrhea and chlamydia.\n\nGonorrhea and Chlamydia\nN. gonorrhoeae infection is the most severe oculo- genital infection that can cause acute conjuncti- vitis, with a hyperacute onset of  copious  puru- lent drainage, eyelid swelling, eye tenderness, preauricular lymphadenopathy, and decreased vision. There is a high risk of corneal involve- ment, including perforation. C. trachomatis infec- tion classically has unilateral involvement and a subacute onset; mucopurulent drainage occurs over a period of weeks to months, and a tender preauricular lymph node and follicles  are  usu-  ally detected on eversion of the eyelid. This patient\u2019s syndrome is not typical for acute gono- coccal or chlamydial conjunctivitis.1\n\nMpox\nMpox is an important consideration in this pa- tient. The worldwide mpox outbreak in 2022 and 2023 has been associated with sexual contact. In the literature that predated the current outbreak, ocular disease was a frequent complication. In a 2014 report of cases occurring in the Demo- cratic Republic of Congo, 23% of patients with confirmed mpox had ocular manifestations, in- cluding conjunctivitis (in approximately 20% of these patients), blepharitis (in approximately 30%), severe keratitis (in approximately 7.5%), photophobia (in approximately 22%), and de- creased visual acuity (in 5 to 10%). Most of these patients were children younger than 10 years of age who had severe disease.6,7\nDuring the current outbreak, the following ocular manifestations have been described: eye- lid pox lesions, conjunctival involvement (folli- cles, papules, vesicles, ulcers, or pseudomem- branes), subconjunctival nodules, blepharitis, and keratitis. However, ocular involvement has been much less common during the current outbreak than during previous outbreaks, affecting less than 1% of patients in retrospective case report- ing, even before the use of antiviral treatment.8-10 Several cases of mpox conjunctivitis have been described in which symptoms developed or worsened while the patient was taking teco- virimat.11\n\nSyphilis\nAny discussion of oculogenital syndromes must include syphilis. The incidence of ocular syphilis has risen in the United States in the past 10 years,12 mirroring the increased incidences of primary and secondary syphilis. Ocular symptoms are most likely to occur with secondary syphilis, typically 2 to 6 months after infection, but can also occur with tertiary syphilis and rarely with primary syphilis. In patients with secondary syphilis, ocular symptoms often have an acute onset, whereas in patients with tertiary syphilis, such symptoms may develop insidiously for 1 to 2 months before the patient seeks care. Ocular syphilis may occur without other signs or symp- toms of syphilis. It is important to note that ocular syphilis may occur after primary or sec- ondary syphilis has been treated with weekly intramuscular penicillin, with or without oral doxycycline, because these agents do not reach therapeutic drug levels in the eye.\nSyphilis can affect any region of the eye. Uve- itis is the most common ocular manifestation, occurring in 75 to 90% of cases of ocular syphilis. Conjunctival involvement can include a chancre (primary disease), papillary conjunctivi- tis (secondary disease), or granulomatous or gummatous conjunctivitis (tertiary disease).13,14 This patient did not have any of these disease manifestations, and isolated conjunctivitis would be very unusual for ocular syphilis.15\nCould this patient have both mpox and syph- ilis? Both diseases are associated with sexual contact, and several cases of coinfection have been reported in the literature.16,17 However, the timing of the onset of this patient\u2019s ocular dis- ease \u2014 relative to either his history of syphilis (treated 5 years earlier) or a possible new case of syphilis (related to new exposure in the previous month) \u2014 would be highly unusual, as would the isolated conjunctivitis without a conjunctival chancre or papillary, granulomatous, or gummatous findings. Therefore, I do not think that syphilis is the cause of his ocular syndrome.\nNevertheless, syphilis is both a vision-threat- ening and treatable disease, and it is critical to rule out the diagnosis with a nontreponemal test (RPR test). In patients with a history of syphilis, treponemal antibodies persist regardless of the efficacy of previous treatment. New or active syphilis would be suggested by an RPR titer that is at least 4 times as high as the most recently obtained (post-treatment) RPR titer.\nI suspect that this patient\u2019s RPR test was negative, which would leave mpox conjunctivitis as the most likely diagnosis. To establish this diagnosis, I would obtain a conjunctival swab or biopsy specimen to be tested for mpox nucleic acids.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Roberto Pineda: The patient\u2019s ophthalmic ex- amination (Fig. 2) revealed findings consistent  with unilateral acute conjunctivitis. He had a history of syphilis but did not have specific ocu- lar manifestations of syphilis, such as an eyelid or conjunctival chancre or a conjunctival gumma, on examination. Although these manifestations have been described, they are rare. In patients with secondary syphilis, mild conjunctivitis is common, but systemic symptoms are typically much more prominent than they were in this patient.18\nAcute viral conjunctivitis is typically a clinical diagnosis. Ancillary testing is usually not indi- cated but may support the diagnosis of some conditions. Mpox conjunctivitis, for example, is often a clinical diagnosis that is supported by the results of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of specimens obtained from nonocular sites.10 However, since the time of this patient\u2019s evaluation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has approved the use of a con- junctival swab in NAAT for mpox.\n",
