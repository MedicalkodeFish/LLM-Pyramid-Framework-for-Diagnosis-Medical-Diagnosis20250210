    "Primary Symptom": "A 22-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea and Chest Pain",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Bethany L. Bartley (Pediatrics): A 22-year-old woman was seen in the pediatric pulmonary clinic of this hospital because of chest pain, cough, and dyspnea on exertion.\nThe patient had been well until she was 2 months of age, when an episode of bronchiolitis occurred. After this episode, repeated respiratory illnesses character- ized by wheezing and cyanosis developed, and she was hospitalized frequently. The patient was subsequently evaluated by a pediatric pulmonologist at this hospital. Examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the apex of the right lung, and chest radiography revealed findings suggestive of congenital lobar emphysema of the right upper lobe. A blood test for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency was negative.\nTransthoracic echocardiography revealed right ventricular dilatation and  hypertro-\nphy, mild pulmonary arterial hypertension, and a small patent ductus arteriosus. When the patient was 24 months of age, a right upper lobectomy, coil emboliza- tion for the patent ductus arteriosus, and a biopsy of the right middle lobe were performed.\nDr. Mari Mino-Kenudson: Histopathological examination of lung specimens re- vealed lobar emphysema of the right upper and middle lobes that was character- ized by the presence of fewer alveoli than the number typically seen in normal lung tissue and hyperinflation of the existing alveoli (Fig. 1A). The number of bronchioles in the peripheral emphysematous areas was disproportionately low relative to the number of pulmonary vessels, and the central bronchi had mucus plugs that may have obliterated the bronchial lumens (Fig. 1B). In the hilum, the central bronchi had mucus plugs that resulted in partial obstruction of the bron- chial lumens, but the amount and contour of the bronchial cartilage were normal (Fig. 1C). No diagnostic findings were consistent with pulmonary hypertension. There are two possible causes of lobar emphysema in this case: obstruction (either intrinsic or extrinsic) of the developing airway, and overinflation of the lung as a result of con- strictive bronchiolitis that was possibly due to infection. Intrinsic obstruction is often caused by defects in the bronchial wall, such as a defi- ciency of bronchial cartilage or intraluminal ob- struction by meconium, mucus plugs, or other substances. In this case, the bronchial cartilage was normal. Mucus plugs were observed at the time of lung resection, but they only partially obstructed the central airways. In addition, there was no evidence of constrictive bronchiolitis, although there were fewer bronchioles than nor- mal in the area of the peripheral lung that was involved by lobar emphysema.\nDr. Bartley: The patient and her family subse-\nquently moved from the United States to another country, and she received medical care at an- other hospital. When she was 6 years of age, a spontaneous pneumothorax occurred, and evalu- ation included genetic testing for Marfan\u2019s syndrome hich was reportedly negative. During the next 16 years, while the patient was still living in another country, dyspnea on exertion and decreased exercise tolerance slowly devel- oped, becoming more marked in the 12 months before this presentation.\nApproximately 6 weeks before this presenta- tion, intermittent chest pain developed. The pain was sharp, could be reproduced with palpation of the affected area, and was not relieved with the administration of ibuprofen. Episodes oc- curred both at rest and with exertion; no precipi- tating or exacerbating factors were identified. The patient was seen in the emergency depart- ment of a local hospital, where an electrocardio- gram was reportedly normal and a radiograph of the chest showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home, and the chest pain con- tinued to occur every few days until presentation. On presentation to the pediatric pulmonary clinic of this hospital, the patient reported that her exercise capacity had declined during the past month and that she had become unable to climb a f light of stairs without having severe breathlessness. She also reported a 1-week his- tory of productive cough; the sputum had initially been clear but then had become dark yellow and, on the day before this presentation, blood-tinged. The patient also had diarrhea but had no fever, chills, weight loss, vomiting, or abdominal pain. She had been born after a full-term gestation and had been delivered by cesarean section be cause of breech presentation; the birth weight was 3175 g. She had a history of depression. Medications included sertraline and inhaled albuterol as needed. She had no known allergies. The patient was fluent in English and Spanish and was an undergraduate student at a European university; she lived on campus during the aca- demic year and spent the rest of the year at her parents\u2019 home in the United States. She did not drink alcohol, smoke tobacco, or use illicit drugs. Her younger brother had a seizure disorder and developmental delays; her mother had mild joint hypermobility, and her father was healthy.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.1\u00b0C,\nthe pulse 82 beats per minute, the blood pressure 116/72  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  18  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 92% while the patient was breathing ambient air at rest. The height was 169 cm, the weight 47.7 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms di- vided by the square of the height in meters) 16.7. A blue hue was noted in the perioral region; no clubbing of the fingers and toes was seen. There was no use of accessory muscles of ventilation; auscultation revealed bronchial breath sounds in the right upper lung fields and diffuse, faint rhonchi during the expiratory phase. Her heart sounds were regular, and no murmur was noted. Hypermobility was present in the joints of the hands and arms. The remainder of the examina- tion was normal.\nPulmonary-function testing was performed. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 23% of the predicted value, the forced vital capacity (FVC) was 45% of the predicted value, and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC was 44%. The total lung capacity was 108% of the predicted value, and the ratio of residual volume to total lung capacity was 65%. The diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was 26% of the pre- dicted value.\nDr. Brent P. Little: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed hyperin- flation of the lungs with severe confluent em- physema and multiple apical bullae (Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C); although diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall and areas of parenchymal air trapping were present, bronchiectasis was nota- bly absent. Normal postsurgical findings includ- ed a stump from right upper lobectomy and coil from embolization of a patent ductus arteriosus. The main pulmonary artery was enlarged, mea- suring 3.8 cm in diameter (Fig. 2D).\nDr. Mark E. Lindsay: Transthoracic echocardiog- raphy revealed dilatation of the right atrium, right ventricle, and inferior vena cava; systolic and diastolic flattening of the interventricular sep- tum (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org); and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 65 mm Hg. The aortic root was not enlarged relative to the pa- tient\u2019s body size, and the aortic valve was tricus- pid. However, the aortic valve was abnormally thickened and was prolapsed, and there was mod- erate aortic regurgitation, which had not been present on echocardiograms obtained during in- fancy. Findings suggestive of constrictive pericar- ditis, including a septal bounce and respiratory variation across the mitral valve, were also seen.\nFigure 2. CT Scan of the Chest.\nAn axial image with lung windows at a level just below the carina (Panel A) shows diffuse emphysema with a panlobu- lar appearance in both lungs (asterisks). A bronchial stump from right upper lobectomy performed for a previous diagnosis of congenital lobar emphysema is seen (arrow). The extensive low-attenuation regions of the lung paren- chyma correspond to emphysema with air trapping, and smaller central areas of higher attenuation (arrowheads) represent less affected lung. The diameters of the pulmonary vessels in the areas of emphysema are smaller than those in the central areas, findings that represent vasoconstriction with vascular shunting toward more normal lung tissue. An axial image of the lower lungs (Panel B) shows the caudal extent of the severe emphysema. Although mild bronchial-wall thickening is present, bronchiectasis is notably absent. A corresponding coronal reformatted image (Panel C) shows the diffuse craniocaudal distribution of severe confluent emphysema. An axial image with soft-tissue windows (Panel D) shows a dilated main pulmonary artery, which measures 3.8 cm in diameter and is larger in diameter than the adjacent ascending aorta.\n\nFigure 1. Lung Specimens.\nOn gross examination, the biopsy specimen of the mid- dle lobe was spongelike. On microscopic examination, there was no evidence of inflammation or fibrosis, but the number of alveoli was substantially lower than the number that would typically be observed in normal lung tissue and the existing alveoli were hyperinflated. On hematoxylin and eosin staining, the simplified, uniform enlargement of air spaces is consistent with lobar em- physema (Panel A). A paucity of respiratory bronchioles in the emphysematous parenchyma is characterized by multiple isolated small pulmonary arteries (Panel B, arrows) without accompanying airways, although alve- olar septa are normal. A section from the hilum shows bronchi with unremarkable immature cartilage and re- spiratory mucosa; mucus plugs are present, but they only partially obstruct a few central airways (Panel C).\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Ted M. Kremer: This patient is a 22-year-old woman with severe emphysematous obstructive lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, aortic regurgitation, and joint hypermobility. She had recurrent wheezing and findings of lobar em- physema in infancy that resulted in resection of the right upper lobe and closure of a patent ductus arteriosus by means of coil embolization when she was 2 years of age. She had an epi- sode of pneumothorax when she was 6 years of age. Her family history is notable for joint hyper- mobility in her mother and seizures and devel- opmental delays in a brother. Emphysematous obstructive lung disease is the central feature of this patient\u2019s presentation, so I will construct my differential diagnosis around this finding. However, to make a unifying diagnosis in this case, I will also need to account for several other abnormalities, including congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and joint hyper- mobility.\nEmphysematous Obstructive Lung Disease\nIn patients with severe emphysematous obstruc- tive lung disease, there is a broad differential diagnosis to consider. Possible causes include postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans, primary lung diseases, childhood interstitial lung dis- eases, immunodeficiency syndromes, autoim- mune disorders, and connective-tissue disor- ders, including hypermobility syndromes.\nPostinfectious Bronchiolitis Obliterans What can cause emphysematous lung disease associated with recurrent wheezing and bron- chiolitis in infancy? Viral infection can cause postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans with emphysematous changes similar to those of the Swyer\u2013James syndrome. Infection with adeno- virus or with other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, is known to cause emphysema- tous syndromes.1 Although a viral infection is a plausible cause of this patient\u2019s illness and can be associated with chronic lung disease, it seems unlikely, considering the additional constella- tion of findings in this case, including con- genital cardiovascular disease and joint hyper- mobility.\nPrimary Lung Diseases\nPrimary lung diseases associated with airflow obstruction and emphysema are strong consid- erations in this case. An alpha1-antitrypsin de- ficiency was reportedly ruled out in infancy. Although this disorder is associated with em- physematous lung disease, that manifestation usually begins in the fifth decade of life.2 This patient was born before routine newborn screen- ing for cystic fibrosis, which also has manifesta- tions of obstructive lung disease; however, cystic fibrosis is not typically severe in infancy, and it is unlikely to cause emphysematous lung changes at a very young age. Furthermore, other manifes- tations of cystic fibrosis, such as malabsorption, would probably also be present. Primary ciliary dyskinesia can progress and cause obstructive lung disease, but this pattern of events typically occurs well after infancy. None of these condi- tions are associated with congenital cardiac findings, but pulmonary hypertension may de- velop later in life as a result of chronic severe obstructive lung disease. Joint hypermobility is uncommon with these conditions.\n\nChildhood Interstitial   Lung   Diseases Childhood interstitial lung diseases are associ- ated with a variety of pulmonary findings.3 Neuroendocrine-cell hyperplasia of infancy and pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis classically occur in infancy. They are associated with dis- tinct findings on imaging, typical pathological features, and usually a more benign course than that seen in this patient. Surfactant dysfunction disorders have various outcomes. Surfactant pro- tein B deficiency is rapidly progressive in infancy and usually leads to death. Surfactant protein C deficiency and mutation in the gene encoding ATP-binding cassette A3 (ABCA3) may be associ- ated with a less severe clinical course than that of surfactant protein B deficiency, but both con- ditions usually result in lifelong pulmonary man- ifestations, such as those seen in this patient. However, none of these conditions are typically associated with congenital cardiac disease, and they do not provide us with a unifying diagnosis in this case.\n\nImmunodeficiency Syndromes\nBecause this patient has obstructive lung disease and a history of recurring pulmonary infections, a diagnosis of an immunodeficiency syndrome is worth considering. Humoral immune respons- es associated with antibody deficiencies increase the risk of sinopulmonary infections and may eventually cause chronic obstructive lung dis- ease. However, this patient has not had recurrent or chronic sinus disease. A variety of other im- munodeficiency syndromes could be considered, but the severity of this patient\u2019s lung disease in infancy, together with the other findings re- ported in infancy in this patient, make these syndromes unlikely.\n\nAutoimmune Disorders\nCertain autoimmune disorders can have associ- ated pulmonary manifestations and joint hyper- mobility. Inflammatory bowel disorders may be associated with bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis ob- literans, and interstitial lung disease and may include joint hypermobility.4,5 These manifesta- tions may be caused by inflammatory bowel disorders but may also be caused by the treat- ment of such disorders or by infections that oc- cur in association with that treatment. In addi- tion, celiac disease may occur with emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and hypermobility. The pa- tient had diarrhea at the time of her recent pre- sentation, but this symptom was not described as persistent. However, an autoimmune disorder is not likely to account for her presentation in infancy or for congenital cardiac disease.\n\nConnective-Tissue Disorders\nThe findings of aortic regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, patent ductus arteriosus, emphy- sema, pneumothorax, and joint hypermobility strongly suggest a connective-tissue disorder such as Marfan\u2019s syndrome, the Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome, or the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome. Mar- fan\u2019s syndrome is an autosomal dominant con- dition caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1).6,7 At 6 years of age, after a spontaneous pneumothorax had developed, this patient underwent genetic testing; this gene was sequenced, and no mutation was identified. The Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome is an autosomal domi- nant disorder that has some phenotypic overlap with Marfan\u2019s syndrome; it is caused by disrup- tion of genes encoding members of the canoni- cal transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) sig- naling cascade and has been reported to be associated with aortic disease, obstructive pul- monary disease, and pneumothorax.8 In contrast with Marfan\u2019s syndrome, which is monogenic, the Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome has been associated with multiple gene loci, including TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, which encode the two subunits of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2). The Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome is associated with mu- tations in several different genes, with multiple genotypic and phenotypic variants, and most commonly is autosomal dominant. Type IV Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, also known as vascu- lar Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, is associated with a defect in the gene encoding type III collagen (COL3A1). Vascular Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome leads to arterial disease and may cause emphysema, pneumothorax, aortic disease, and patent ductus arteriosus.9-12 This patient\u2019s disease in young adulthood has manifestations that suggest an Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome phenotype, but the onset in infancy reduces the likelihood of this possibility.\nIn recent years, a disorder similar to the Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome that is caused by muta- tions in the gene encoding filamin A (FLNA) has been recognized. FLNA-related disease is an X-linked dominant condition that has highly variable phenotypic features. The most common manifestations include a neurologic disorder called periventricular heterotopia (a neuronal migration defect), seizure, thrombocytopenia, gas- trointestinal dysmotility, poor growth, skeletal dysplasia, and hypermobility.13 Different combi- nations of these findings may result in different types of FLNA-related disease; these differences are probably based on genetic variation. FLNA- related disease is frequently fatal in male pa- tients.\nThere is emerging recognition of a respiratory phenotype of this genetic disorder that occurs in infancy and has unique features, including car diovascular  manifestations  (aortic-valve disease and dilatation, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmonary hypertension) and pulmonary manifestations (emphysema and lung cysts alternating with atelectasis and tracheobronchomalacia or stenosis).14-21 A recent review summarizes the cases reported in the literature to date.22 Thus far, at least 18 cases of FLNA-related disease with this respiratory phenotype have been identified in infancy. Most of the infants identified were girls, and respiratory symptoms developed at ap- proximately 1 month of age. The outcomes were variable and included the use of oxygen support, lobectomy of severely emphysematous lobes, and ligation of a patent ductus arteriosus if present. Several patients underwent lung transplantation, one patient had a heart transplantation, and a small number of patients died from severe lung disease. The respiratory phenotype of FLNA- related disease is now considered to be a child- hood interstitial lung disease.21 The filamin A protein is thought to be important in the matu- ration of alveoli in embryologic life, a process that affects lung growth and development. Find- ings similar to bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to alveolar simplification have been noted.19 The cause of FLNA mutation seems to vary and has been linked to deletions, missense changes, du- plications, and nonsense variants, all of which may have a role in the phenotypic outcome.\nThis patient has a clinical picture that strong-\nly suggests an FLNA mutation characterized by diffuse emphysematous lung disease with severe airflow obstruction that began in infancy, as well as congenital cardiac manifestations (aortic disease, patent ductus arteriosus, and pulmo- nary hypertension) and the connective-tissue finding of joint hypermobility. Her family his- tory raises unique questions and is probably re- lated to this disorder. The joint hypermobility that was diagnosed in her mother may provide evidence of an X-linked condition. At this point, it is unclear whether the brother\u2019s history of seizures and developmental delays is associated with the disorder, but these conditions may be worth exploring. It would be unusual but possi- ble for an FLNA mutation to occur in a young adult, given the description of the respiratory phenotype in recent years.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. T. Bernard Kinane: This patient initially under- went genetic screening for a connective-tissue disorder when she was 6 years of age, and no mutations were identified. However, genetic panels have expanded over time, and a genetic panel to test for connective-tissue disorder was obtained during the current evaluation.\nThe test results showed a heterozygous muta- tion in FLNA: c.6830_6831delTT (p.Phe2277Ter). This frameshift mutation results in premature termination of transcription near an important functional domain of the filamin A protein, an important component of the cellular cytoskele- ton.23 The filamin A protein links actin, which is essential to the regulation of cell shape and migration, to the cell surface. Mutations in FLNA result in a range of clinical syndromes.24 Gain- of-function mutations result in skeletal dysplasia with hearing loss (otopalatodigital syndrome types I and II and the Melnick\u2013Needles syndrome).25 Loss-of-function mutations in FLNA were first described in patients with periventricu- lar heterotopia, which is an anomaly in which groups of neurons fail to migrate from the peri- ventricular region to the cerebral cortex.26 Such patients usually present with seizures during the teenage years. Less commonly, microcephaly and developmental delays are seen. Since the muta- tions were first described, features such as dila- tation of the aorta, cardiac valvular dysplasia, f lexible joints, and fragile blood vessels have been increasingly recognized.\nMore recently, cases of FLNA mutation with\npulmonary manifestations have been identified. The first case was identified in 2011.20 Since then, 17 additional case reports of lung disease have been described in the literature, but more cases are being recognized in the clinic, particu- larly in lung transplantation centers.15-22,27 Of the 18 patients, 15 were female, which suggests that males are more likely to be severely affected and are less likely to survive to birth. All but 1 of these patients were born at full term. All had periventricular heterotopia. The onset of lung disease occurred during the first 3 months of life in all 18 patients. In 17 patients, CT scans showed areas with lung hyperinflation, a find- ing that was also seen in this case. In many of the patients, whole lobes were hyperinflated and lobar emphysema was noted. In total, 10 of the patients had a patent ductus arteriosus, and 4 had pulmonary hypertension. A total of 8 patients died or had lung transplantation. Most of these patients had mutations that occurred near im- portant functional domains of the molecule, such as the actin-binding domain and the domain that is important for dimerization of these molecules. In this case, the mutation occurred near an area that is important for both integrin binding and dimerization. In the case reports, 13 patients had a duplication or deletion with a resulting frameshift mutation, 1 had a nonsense mutation, and 4 had a missense mutation. There was no apparent association between mutation type and outcome, but the number of cases is small. Overall, this patient had a typical pulmo- nary presentation and phenotype for a patient with an FLNA mutation.\n",
