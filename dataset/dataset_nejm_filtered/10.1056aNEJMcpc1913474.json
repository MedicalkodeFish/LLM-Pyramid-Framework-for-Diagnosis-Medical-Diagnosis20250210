    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Mark A. Matza (Medicine): A 68-year-old man was transferred to this hospital because of neurologic decline, progressive renal insufficiency, and leukopenia.\nSeven months before this admission, the patient was admitted to another hos- pital after routine laboratory testing had identified abnormalities, including a creatinine level of 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 mmol per liter; reference range, 0.50 to 1.40 mg per deciliter [44 to 124 mmol per liter]), a blood urea nitrogen level of 54 mg per deciliter (19 mmol per liter; reference range, 7 to 30 mg per deciliter [2.5 to 11 mmol per liter]), and a calcium level of 12.1 mg per deciliter (3.0 mmol per liter; reference range, 8.8 to 10.6 mg per deciliter [2.2 to 2.6 mmol per liter]). Twelve months earlier, the creatinine level had been 1.7 mg per deciliter (150 mmol per liter). On admission to the other hospital, he reported unintentional weight loss of 14 kg over the preceding 12 months, malaise, waking every 2 hours to empty his bladder, and new mild exertional dyspnea. The temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the  heart  rate  92  beats  per  minute,  the  blood  pressure  117/74  mm  Hg,  and  the oxygen saturation 96% while he was breathing ambient air. The weight was 68 kg and the body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 23.5. Examination was notable for cachexia and hepato- splenomegaly (with the liver and spleen palpable 6 cm below the costal margin) without lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was reportedly nor- mal. Blood levels of magnesium, bilirubin, globulin, creatine kinase, uric acid, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal; other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1. Serum protein electrophoresis results were normal; urine protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal light-chain bands.\nDr. Jo-Anne O. Shepard: Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis,\nperformed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, reportedly revealed focal nodular soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. Spleno- megaly and left paraaortic adenopathy were present. Small pulmonary nodules and patchy consolidation were observed, along with a small left pleural effusion.\nDr. Matza: After treatment with intravenous normal saline and furosemide, the calcium level normalized and the creatinine level decreased to\n2.3 mg per deciliter (203 mmol per liter). The patient was discharged on the fourth hospital day. Dr. Rory K. Crotty: A bone marrow biopsy per- formed 2 weeks later at the first hospital re- vealed hypercellular marrow and multiple non- necrotizing granulomas. Staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi was negative. No cultures were\nobtained.\nDr. Matza: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was 89 U per liter (reference range, 9 to 67). A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was consid- ered, and therapy with high-dose oral prednisone was started.\nOne month later, the ACE level decreased to 41 U per liter, and the patient\u2019s energy level and appetite improved. Attempts to taper the dose of prednisone were unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.\nThree months later, the patient was evaluated by a pulmonologist at the first hospital for pul- monary sarcoidosis. Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethox- azole was initiated for prophylaxis against pneu- mocystis while the patient continued to receive high-dose prednisone. Tests of pulmonary func- tion showed mild obstruction, with a clinically significant response after the use of a broncho- dilator, and moderate restriction, with moder- ately reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. A second attempt to taper the dose of prednisone was unsuccessful owing to increased fatigue and exertional dyspnea.\nDuring the next 2 months, intermittent con-\nfusion, progressive weakness in the legs, right foot drop, and increasing unsteadiness and gait instability developed; the patient began to use a walker to ambulate. He also had at least two falls. He required help from his wife to perform activities of daily living, including bathing and dressing.\nThe patient was evaluated by a rheumatolo- gist at the first hospital. Complement levels were normal, as was the level of rheumatoid factor. Tests for antinuclear antibodies (ANA),\n \nantineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Weekly treatment with oral meth- otrexate and folic acid was started for presumed sarcoidosis.\nEleven days later, the patient presented to a second hospital with a new facial droop on the left side, slurred speech, and confusion. The temperature was 36.4\u00b0C, the heart rate 102 beats per minute, the blood pressure 141/86 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 99% while he was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 63 kg and the BMI 21.9. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time; neuro- logic examination was notable for a mild facial droop on the left side, mildly increased muscle tone, right foot drop, and symmetric mild weak- ness in the arms and upper legs. Cachexia, tachycardia, and splenomegaly were noted. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Pamela W. Schaefer: Magnetic resonance im-\naging (MRI) of the head revealed a 12-mm right subdural hygroma with a midline shift of 10 mm, a right cerebellar cavernous malformation, and numerous punctate foci (in the pons, left cere- bellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus) characterized by hyperintensity on fluid-attenu- ated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging and restricted diffusion.\nDr. Matza: Clopidogrel and levetiracetam were initiated. Echocardiography did not show intra- cardiac thrombus or shunting; carotid ultrasonog- raphy did not show stenosis. Electromyography revealed evidence of mild L5\u2013S1 radiculopathy and right ulnar and median neuropathy, but there was no evidence of myopathy or upper mo- tor neuron disease. Owing to progressive leuko- penia (white-cell count, 1390 per microliter) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 51,000 per microliter), methotrexate, clopidogrel, levetirace- tam, and trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole were discontinued; cyanocobalamin was started.\nOn the fourth hospital day, a fever with a\ntemperature of 38.3\u00b0C developed; specimens of blood and urine were obtained for culture, and intravenous vancomycin and cefepime were initi- ated. The C-reactive protein level was 101.8 mg per liter. Blood tests for ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, influenza type A and B antigens, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 p24 antigen, antibodies to HIV types 1 and 2, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, hepatitis B virus core anti- bodies, cytomegalovirus DNA, Epstein\u2013Barr virus DNA, and parvovirus IgM were negative, as were urine tests for legionella antigen and histoplasma antigen. A rapid plasma reagin test was negative, and an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for the detec- tion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was reported as indeterminate.\nDr. Shepard: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed scattered ground-glass opacities in the lungs, nodular and consolidative opacities in the lungs, mildly en- larged mediastinal lymph nodes, small pleural effusions, and splenomegaly (with the spleen measuring 16 cm in the cephalocaudad dimen- sion; normal length, <13 cm). Focal soft-tissue thickening along the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta and prominence of the soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta were also noted.\nThe next day, magnetic resonance angiography was performed. A T2-weighted fat-saturated image (Fig. 1A) showed signal hyperintensity in the soft tissue around the infrarenal aorta and in the adjacent left paraaortic lymph nodes that was indicative of adenopathy, with a focal ab- dominal aortic pseudoaneurysm seen on time- of-flight imaging (Fig. 1B).\nDr. Matza: On the eighth hospital day, a bone marrow biopsy was performed. On the ninth day, the patient was transferred to this hospital. On the patient\u2019s arrival, a review of systems was limited owing to delirium, and history was obtained in part from the patient\u2019s family. The review was notable for months of fatigue, mal- aise, leg weakness, right foot drop, waxing and waning confusion, exertional dyspnea, and an inability to walk and perform activities of daily living. Palpitations, dry cough, easy bruising, and irritable bladder were present, but he had no chills, anorexia, joint pain, erythema, rashes, nodules, myalgia, chest pain, dizziness, productive cough, hemoptysis, orthopnea, wheezing, gastro- intestinal symptoms, dysuria, hematuria, ocular or nasal symptoms, skin or nail changes, or headache.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for hypothyroidism, hypertension, hypercholesterol- emia, progressive kidney disease, degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine, scoliosis, tubu- lar adenoma, and leukopenia. Eight years before this admission, a mass in the bladder that mea- sured 4.5 cm by 4.0 cm was noted on ultraso- nography, which had been performed for evalu- ation of hematuria. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed at another hospital, but the resection was reportedly in- complete. Histologic examination revealed non\u2013 muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. Repeat cystoscopy and transurethral resection, performed 3, 8, and 16 months after the initial procedures, each revealed fragments of non\u2013 muscle-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma, and intravesical bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) was administered. Cystoscopy, performed 1 year before this admission for the management of bladder stones, identified a recurrent polypoid bladder tumor, which was treated with trans- urethral resection.\nOutpatient medications included prednisone,\nmethotrexate, folic acid, aspirin, levothyroxine, simvastatin, tamsulosin, cholecalciferol, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, omeprazole, tri- methoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fluticasone\u2013salmet- erol, and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Penicillin had caused an unknown reaction.\nThe patient was a retired pharmacist and lived with his wife. He had a remote history of smok- ing a half pack of cigarettes daily for 2 years and drank alcohol infrequently. He had not traveled recently and had had no environmental, animal, or toxic exposures. There was no family history of autoimmune, neurologic, infectious, or pul- monary disorders.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pressure 122/76 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The weight was 54 kg and the BMI 18.8. He was anxious, cachectic, and appeared chronically ill. He correctly reported his name, location, and the time and date; however, he was unable to follow simple two-step commands. The cranial-nerve examination revealed a subtle facial droop on the left side. There were tremors in the arms and legs at rest and with motion, as well as right foot drop and diffusely increased tone. Finger\u2013 nose\u2013finger testing showed dysmetria. Bibasilar crackles (greater in the left lung than in the right) were heard on lung auscultation. Hepato- splenomegaly was present. There were diffuse ecchymoses on the trunk, arms, and legs. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nThe international normalized ratio and blood levels of ammonia, bilirubin, creatine kinase, folic acid, globulin, haptoglobin, lactate dehydro- genase, lactic acid, and magnesium were nor- mal. The ACE level was 36 U per liter (reference range, 8 to 53). Serum protein electrophoresis showed no bands, but a mild, diffuse decrease in globulin was noted. The urine free kappa light-chain level was 134.2 mg per deciliter (ref- erence range, 0.4 to 15.1), and the urine free lambda light-chain level was 35.6 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.8 to 10.1), with a normal ratio (3.77; reference range, 0.50 to 4.00). Other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1. Cultures of blood, urine, and sputum were obtained. Dur- ing the first 3 days of this admission, the patient became lethargic; when he was awakened, his speech was incoherent and dysarthric.\nDr. Schaefer: On the third hospital day, MRI of\nthe head (Fig. 2) with magnetic resonance angi- ography revealed a stable right subdural hygro- ma with a midline shift of 10 mm, as well as a stable right cerebellar cavernous malformation. There were punctate and patchy foci character- ized by hyperintensity on FLAIR imaging and restricted diffusion in the midbrain, pons, me- dulla, left cerebellum, right occipital lobe, and left thalamus; the foci had increased in size and extent from the previous study.\nDr. Shepard: Positron-emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT (Fig. 1D through 1F) revealed multiple foci of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in periaortic soft tissue and paraaortic lymph nodes, in the axial skeleton (cervical vertebral body, ribs, manubrium, and sacrum), and in the left testis.\nDr. Matza: Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan, coxiella antibodies, cytomegalo- virus IgM and IgG, cryptococcal antigen, human chorionic gonadotropin, and Treponema pallidum antibodies were negative, as was a urine test for histoplasma antigen. Electroencephalographic monitoring showed frequent sharp, irregular delta and theta discharges; treatment with leveti- racetam was started.\nOn the fourth hospital day, the temperature was 38.3\u00b0C. Ultrasound images showed testes of normal size and echotexture without focal le- sions, but the epididymides were enlarged and heterogeneous. The kidneys were normal in size, with diffusely echogenic parenchyma, and a 19-mm bladder stone was present. A transtho- racic echocardiogram showed normal ventricu- lar function, no evidence of clinically significant valvular disease, and a mildly dilated aorta. Flow cytometry showed a markedly reduced CD4+ T-cell count (11 per microliter; reference range, 348 to 1456). Antibody tests for bartonella and brucella were negative.\nSomnolence progressed, and on the fifth hos- pital day, the right pupil was noted to be slightly larger than the left and the patient had increased tremor. Fosphenytoin therapy was initiated, and he was transferred to the neurologic intensive care unit. The oxygen saturation declined to 90% while he was receiving supplemental oxy- gen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute, and a Cheyne\u2013Stokes pattern of res- piration was observed. The trachea was intubat- ed, and mechanical ventilation was initiated.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. David B. Hellmann: Over the course of nearly 2 years, this 68-year-old man lost almost 35% of his body mass; sustained severe damage to his lungs, brain, spleen, liver, bone marrow, testis, vascular system, and bones; and became unable to think clearly, communicate effectively, and care for himself. This deterioration undoubtedly alarmed him, his family, and his doctors and created an urgent need for establishing the cor- rect diagnosis.\nAn effective approach to the daunting task of establishing a diagnosis in a patient with such a complicated illness is to first select the single feature that has the most limited differential diagnosis and then consider how the other clinical information provided in the case history affects the probability of the diagnoses being considered. I think that the finding of aortitis provides the best focal point for constructing my differential diagnosis, and I hope it will be the key to unraveling this challenging case.\nAortitis and Mycotic Aneurysm\nThis patient has aortitis, a finding supported by multiple imaging studies (Fig. 1). Imaging clues of aortitis caused by infection include eccentric rather than circumferential involvement of the aorta, multiple \u201cskip areas\u201d or foci of aortic in- flammation (rather than continuous stretches of aortic disease), saccular outpouchings in the aorta, focal intense FDG uptake on PET, and soft-tissue masses or inflammation around the aorta. All these features occurred in this patient. Additional imaging clues of infection-caused aortitis, which are not seen in every case, include rapid progression of the aortitis and the presence of paraaortic air. Although these latter features were absent in this patient, the extensive imag- ing findings strongly indicate that he has an infection-caused aortitis and that the aortic out- pouchings seen in this patient represent mycotic aneurysms. Aortitis can be classified as having either noninfectious or infectious causes (Table 2).\nSome clinicians reserve the term \u201cmycotic aneurysm\u201d for infected aneurysms associated with endocarditis, whereas others use the term more generally, as I do, for any infected aneurysm. Mycotic is a misnomer, since bacteria rather than fungi cause most mycotic aneurysms.  Before the widespread use of antimicrobial therapy, syphilis was the most common cause of infected aortic aneurysm; now, staphylococcus and salmonella are the most common causes. Infections cause mycotic aortic aneurysms through seeding of atherosclerotic ulcerations, production of an obliterative endarteritis of the vasa vaso- rum, or contiguous spread from an infected paraaortic lymph node or vertebral body.\n\nHypercalcemia\nThe finding of hypercalcemia helps to further narrow the differential diagnosis in this case. Approximately 90% of patients with hypercalce- mia have either hyperparathyroidism or cancer. However, this patient\u2019s low parathyroid hormone level makes a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism unlikely. Although the slight elevation in his level of parathyroid hormone\u2013related protein suggests that he may have humoral hypercalce- mia of malignancy, the high-normal levels of both phosphorus and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D indicate that his hypercalcemia is most likely caused by the presence of activated macro- phages capable of accelerating the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvita- min D. Activated macrophages and hypercalcemia can be seen in cases of sarcoidosis, lym- phoma, and granulomatous infections.\n\nSarcoidosis\nIn very rare cases, lymphoma and sarcoidosis can cause aortitis; however, neither condition results in mycotic aortic aneurysms, which were seen in this patient. Sarcoidosis was the initial explanation for his lung disease, hypercalcemia, and noncaseating granulomas found in the bone marrow biopsy specimen. Sarcoidosis could also have explained his central nervous system (CNS) disease. In addition to the mycotic aneurysms, other findings in this patient are not consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. These include resistance to high-dose prednisone and the pres- ence of pleural effusions, which do not occur in sarcoidosis in the absence of necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis; the bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of necrotizing sarcoid granulomato- sis. Together, the findings rule out sarcoidosis.\n\nMycobacterial Infection\nThe negative blood cultures and the negative serologic tests for fungal infections indicate that the probable cause of this patient\u2019s aortitis was a mycobacterial infection. The most likely candi- date is BCG, an attenuated live strain of M. bovis that is most commonly administered during childhood as a vaccine to prevent tuberculosis. It is also commonly used, as it was for this patient, as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Local and systemic complications of intravesical instillation of BCG occur in less than 5% of patients who receive such treatment. In one large series, 96% of the patients with complications from BCG treatment were men, and the average age was 67 years.2 Mycotic aortic aneurysms developed in nearly 6% of the patients evaluated in this series. The abdominal aorta was more commonly involved than the thoracic aorta, but there can be involvement of both regions of the aorta, as was seen in this patient; the iliac artery can also be involved. In most patients, systemic manifestations develop within a year after BCG treatment, but delays of nearly a decade have been reported. This patient\u2019s presentation of mycotic aortic aneurysm 7 years after BCG instillation is within the time range reported. In the series described above, 3.5% of the patients with BCG-associated aortitis also had epididymitis\u2013orchitis, similar to this patient.2\nThe single feature that was prominent in this patient but, to our knowledge, has not been de- scribed previously in patients with BCG-related mycotic aortic aneurysm is parenchymal brain disease. It is possible that 6 months of predni- sone therapy facilitated dissemination of the infection to his brain. Although reports of the presence of CNS involvement in other patients with BCG-related aortitis are lacking, such man- ifestations can occur with BCG and with other mycobacterial infections. Indeed, a case of CNS vasculitis caused by BCG was recently described.3 BCG infection can also readily explain this pa- tient\u2019s slow course of illness, hepatosplenomegaly, bony lesions, granulomas (which are not always caseating in mycobacterial infection), and hypercalcemia.\nI cannot rule out the possibility that the patient had tuberculosis. He had worked as a phar- macist and could have had an occupational ex- posure to a patient with tuberculosis. Although such an exposure is possible, his exposure to BCG is definite. For that reason, I think that the patient most likely had disseminated infection resulting from BCG treatment. To establish the diagnosis of disseminated BCG infection, I would recommend analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for evidence of mycobacterial infection.\n",
