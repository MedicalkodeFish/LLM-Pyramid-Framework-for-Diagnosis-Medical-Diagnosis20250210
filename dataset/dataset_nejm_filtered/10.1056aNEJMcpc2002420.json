    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jacqueline B. Henson (Medicine): A 54-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital after cardiac arrest associated with ventricular fibrillation.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until midday on the day of admission, when he was in a fast-food restaurant and gasped suddenly, with full- body shaking and loss of consciousness. The shaking movements ceased quickly, but he remained unresponsive. Emergency medical services personnel arrived after approximately 4 minutes, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated. The heart rhythm was identified as ventricular fibrillation; four shocks were deliv- ered, and the patient received intravenous naloxone, amiodarone, and a bolus of epinephrine followed by a continuous infusion. A slow, wide-complex heart rhythm with a rate of 40 beats per minute was noted, reportedly with concurrent return of mental status, but CPR had to be resumed after pulselessness recurred.\nThe patient arrived at this hospital 30 minutes after the initial arrest. The pa- tient was an unresponsive, middle-aged man who had undergone mechanical CPR and had no external signs of trauma. Empirical intravenous calcium chloride, dex- trose and insulin, and sodium bicarbonate were administered. In addition, vaso- pressin, norepinephrine, rocuronium, and ketamine were administered intrave- nously, and aspirin was administered rectally. Emergency intubation of the trachea was performed, and an orogastric tube, a femoral arterial catheter, and a femoral central venous catheter were placed.\nDr. Neel M. Butala: An electrocardiogram (ECG) (Fig. 1A) showed uncertain atrial activity; a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, with a very wide QRS complex and multifocal premature ventricular con- tractions; possible elevations of the ST segment in leads aVR, aVL, and V1; and the presence of U waves.\nDr. Henson: Initial laboratory test results obtained 25 minutes after the patient arrived at this hospital are shown in Table 1. Cardiac ultrasound images obtained at the bed- side showed marked global left ventricular dys- function. Spontaneous circulation was restored; the heart rate was 108 beats per minute and the blood pressure 139/92 mm Hg while the patient was receiving intravenous epinephrine and nor- epinephrine. A repeat ECG (Fig. 1B) showed find- ings similar to those seen on presentation.\nThe neurology service was consulted. A re- peat examination, performed after the medica- tions used for sedation were discontinued, re- vealed anisocoria and sluggishly reactive pupils (the left was 7 mm in diameter, and the right was 5 mm); corneal reflexes and response to noxious stimuli were absent. Therapeutic hypothermia was not initiated.\nDr. Laura L. Avery: Computed tomography of the head (Fig. 1C), performed without the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, revealed preservation of differentiation between gray and white matter, without evidence of territorial in- farct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions. Dr. Butala: The patient was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where a trans- aortic percutaneous ventricular assist device was placed through the femoral artery, and thereaf- ter, the patient was weaned from epinephrine and norepinephrine. Coronary angiography (Fig. 1D and 1E) revealed only minimal luminal irregu- larities (see Videos 1 and 2, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Subsequent catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart revealed a right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 27 mm Hg, and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 30 mm Hg. The pulmonary arterial oxy- gen saturation was 85%.\nDr. Henson: Additional laboratory test results returned during the catheterization procedure (Table 1) were notable for a blood potassium level of 2.0 mmol per liter (normal range, 3.4 to 5.0). The patient received 60 mmol of enteral potas- sium chloride and 80 mmol of intravenous po- tassium chloride. Three hours after the patient arrived at this hospital, he was admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (ICU), whereupon lim- ited additional history was available from family and friends.\nThere was no history of chest pain, dyspnea, or symptoms of heart failure or dysrhythmia. He had a poor diet, consisting primarily of several packages of candy daily; 3 weeks earlier, he had switched the type of candy he was eating. He had no sick contacts, fever or chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nMedical history included previous heroin use disorder and untreated hepatitis C virus infec- tion. The patient had never had any adverse drug reactions. He worked in construction. He did not drink alcohol, he smoked one pack of cigarettes daily and had done so for 36 years, and he had reportedly been abstinent from opiates for the previous 3 years. There was no family history of cardiac, respiratory, renal, neurologic, or endo- crine disease.\nThe temperature was 34.0\u00b0C, the heart rate 119 beats per minute, the blood pressure 81/53 mm Hg (on the percutaneous ventricular assist device), and the oxygen saturation 95% while the patient was receiving oxygen through a mechani- cal ventilator (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.50; respiratory rate, 24 breaths per minute; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5 cm of water; tidal vol- ume, 450 ml). On examination, he was unrespon- sive; the pupils remained sluggishly reactive and asymmetric. No cough or gag was noted, and corneal reflexes remained absent. There were no lacerations on the tongue. The heart rhythm was tachycardic and intermittently irregular, but no murmur was noted. The skin was warm, without rashes or bruises. The remainder of the examina- tion was unremarkable.\nThe blood levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, amylase, lipase, and carboxyhemoglobin were nor- mal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Potassium chloride (at a dose of 40 mmol) was administered intravenously.\nDr. Butala: An ECG (Fig. 2A) showed sinus tachycardia with alternating left anterior fascicu- lar block and left bundle-branch block, as well as corrected QT (QTc) prolongation.\nDr. Avery: A chest radiograph (Fig. 2B) showed clear lungs, with no evidence of pneumothorax, and a normal-sized cardiac silhouette. The endo- tracheal tube, pulmonary-artery catheter, and per- cutaneous ventricular assist device were all appro- priately positioned.\nDr. Butala: Transthoracic echocardiography (Fig. 2C) showed normal left ventricular size but severe biventricular dysfunction, which was new relative to an outpatient study obtained 16 months earlier that had shown normal biventricular func- tion. The percutaneous ventricular assist device was confirmed to be in an appropriate position, and there was no evidence of pericardial effusion (see Video 3).\nDr. Henson: Intravenous clevidipine was admin- istered for elevated blood pressure. Telemetric monitoring showed frequent ventricular couplets and triplets, as well as runs of nonsustained ven- tricular tachycardia. Amiodarone was infused intravenously. Additional arterial blood gas mea- surements were obtained 2 hours after the pa- tient arrived at the ICU (Table 1), and the patient received 60 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride, followed by an additional 40 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride 2 hours later.\nDr. Butala: A repeat ECG (Fig. 2D) showed si- nus tachycardia with a normal QRS duration, ventricular ectopic beat, nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities, U waves, and QTc pro- longation.\nDr. Henson: Four hours later, an additional 40 mmol of intravenous potassium chloride was administered after more test results were received. The patient\u2019s family provided additional history, and a diagnosis was made.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page). Initial ECGs, CT Scan of the Head, and Cardiac Catheterization Studies.\nElectrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained on presentation (Panel A) and after the return of spontaneous circula\u2011 tion (Panel B) show uncertain atrial activity; a regular accelerated idioventricular rhythm at a rate of 70 beats per minute, with a very wide QRS complex and multifo\u2011 cal premature ventricular contractions (white arrows); possible elevations of the ST segment in leads aVR, aVL, and V1; and the presence of U waves (black ar\u2011 rows). An axial computed tomographic (CT) image of the head (Panel C), obtained without the administra\u2011 tion of contrast material, was normal, without evidence of infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, or mass lesions.\nImages from a left coronary angiogram (Panel D) and a right coronary angiogram (Panel E) show only minimal luminal irregularities.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Elazer R. Edelman: This 54-year-old man pres- ents with multiorgan failure, profound metabolic derangements, and marked hypokalemia after cardiac arrest associated with ventricular fibril- lation. Faced with such clinical complexity, I will focus first on the processes that govern potas- sium regulation and homeostasis, since they are essential for understanding and connecting the observed metabolic, renal, vascular, and cardiac conduction defects.\n\nPotassium Regulation\nThe blood potassium level is the product of in- gestion, internal recirculation, and elimination in the gastrointestinal and renal systems. Hypo- kalemia may arise from starvation or anorexia, drivers of internal recirculation (including shifts in acid\u2013base status, as well as ion balance and internalization), and gastrointestinal or renal loss of potassium. Gastrointestinal loss of potassium can be ruled out in this case, since there is no history of vomiting, diarrhea, use of a nasogastric tube, or previous ureterosigmoidostomy. The most likely cause of this patient\u2019s hypokalemia is re- nal loss of potassium resulting from mineralo- corticoid excess, rather than from renal tubular acidosis or medications such as diuretic agents or amphotericin.\n\nMineralocorticoid Excess\nIn the physiologic state, the ligands aldosterone and cortisol bind to the mineralocorticoid recep- tor and together link the powerful regulators of ion, salt, and water balance in the cortical col- lecting duct of the kidney with pressure, volume, and vasomotion in the cardiovascular system. There are multiple means by which this system can go awry at the ligand or receptor level (or both), resulting in primary or secondary causes of hyper- aldosteronism or corticosteroid excess, as well as causes related to an excess or paucity of renin. In this patient, we can rule out hyperrenin- emic hyperaldosteronism (ligand overstimulation), given that there is no evidence of renin-secreting tumors, renal-artery stenosis, decreased volume or chronic heart failure, edema or ascites, or syndromic elements that may affect the receptor. Similarly, there is no evidence of excess aldoste- rone with hyporeninism (ligand overproduction), which can occur with adrenal hyperplasia or in the context of adenomatous or cancerous growth of aldosterone-secreting cells of the adrenal cor- tex (Conn\u2019s syndrome). In addition, there is no evidence of adrenal medullary or pituitary tumors that can generate an excess of corticosteroids.\nI suspect that the physiologic mechanism that is causing this patient\u2019s hypokalemia is most likely from mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid excess stimulated by an exogenous compound (such as a medication or food product) or endog- enous agents secreted by pituitary, adrenal, or ectopic tumors. Many of this patient\u2019s abnormal laboratory values, such as the elevations in he- matopoietic cell lines, could be ascribed to the effect of a corticosteroid. Historically, the cardiac glycoside digitalis has been prescribed to treat heart failure and arrhythmias. If this patient, who had malnutrition, renal failure, and metabolic derangements, was taking digitalis products, the resulting toxic effects would be high on my dif- ferential diagnosis. Today, digitalis compounds are rarely prescribed, and they were not present in this patient. Diuretic or laxative use and abuse may cause some elements of this patient\u2019s pre- sentation, as could a drug such as abiraterone or a substance such as grapefruit juice, but none of these are reported in the case history.\n\nAcquired Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess Apparent mineralocorticoid excess\u2013like syndromes can mimic the effects of cortisol overabundance. Cortisol and aldosterone have similar binding affinities for the mineralocorticoid receptor, but the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2HSD2) converts cortisol to cortisone, thereby preventing cortisol from binding to and\nactivating the receptor. If this enzyme is blocked or inhibited, cortisol can activate the receptor, which would stimulate potassium wasting, so- dium retention, hypertension, and metabolic al- kalosis. Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure, both features of this patient\u2019s presentation, could occur, resulting in an increased likelihood of ventricular irritability and arrhythmias. Such enzymatic de- fects can be a manifestation of a genetic disor- der such as an autosomal recessively inherited mutation of HSD11B2, which encodes the kidney isozyme of 11\u03b2HSD2. Patients with this muta- tion usually present at a young age with severe hypertension and end-organ manifestations, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and retinal, renal, and neurologic vascular changes, along with growth retardation and failure to thrive. This pa- tient is middle-aged and has a relatively unre- markable medical history; hence, the presence of an acquired enzymatic disorder is more likely than an underlying undiagnosed genetic abnormality.\nThe notable aspect of each of the increasing\nnumber of compounds that can induce apparent mineralocorticoid excess (cortisol, digitalis, glycyrrhetinic acid, and abiraterone) is that they are structurally similar to one another and to aldo- sterone (Fig. 3). Thus, it is not difficult to imag- ine that each of these compounds could cause an acquired apparent mineralocorticoid excess. In fact, this chemical similarity could well be used to predict the potential of emerging compounds to induce apparent mineralocorticoid excess.\n\nLicorice and Glycyrrhetinic Acid\nWe are told that this patient has a poor diet and eats a lot of candy. Could his illness be related to candy consumption? Licorice has long been used as a medication and a food sweetener, al- beit not without side effects. In 1946, the Dutch physician\u2013scientist Revers reported that the ac- tive ingredient (succus liquiritiae, or \u201clicorice juice\u201d) of a proprietary preparation relieved gas- trointestinal ulcer disease.1 However, when the preparation was modified, the beneficial effect was accompanied by edema, headache, and dys- pnea on exertion.2 In subsequent studies, re- searchers isolated glycyrrhizic acid from licorice preparations and initially surmised a direct ef- fect on the mineralocorticoid receptor; subse- quently, they determined that there was an indi- rect effect through inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD2.3 The resultant unimpeded presence of cortisol can cause hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, fatal arrhythmias, and renal failure \u2014 the constel- lation of signs and symptoms seen in this patient, many of which were observed by Revers.\nIn short, water and sodium retention and potassium wasting arise from toxic effects of ATPase activity in the collecting duct, which also increases blood pressure through expansion of blood volume. Counterregulatory measures re- duce renal renin and angiotensin II secretion and aldosterone production in the adrenal cor- tex. However, increasing cortisol levels and un- restricted activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol can raise the level of aldoste- rone (pseudohyperaldosteronism), which can then elicit a cascade of further elevation in blood vol- ume and cardiac preload. In addition, glycyrrhe- tinic acid itself can inhibit reduction of aldoste- rone by hepatic enzymes (5\u03b2-reductase and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), thereby further increasing circulating aldosterone levels. These competing phenomena have variable effects on aldosterone levels. Elevated vasomotor tone is maintained as nitric oxide bioavailability is re- duced and vascular endothelin is increased, en- hancing contractile responses to pressor hor- mones (Fig. 4).4\nEffects on cardiac conduction are similar to other inhibitors of sodium\u2013potassium ATPase.5 Earlier reference to the plant-derived cardiac gly- coside digitalis is not tangential. Although glycyr- rhetinic acid and digitalis act at different sites, both affect ionic balance in the control of action potential\u2013driven impulse generation and conduc- tion. Given that the root-derived glycoside glycyr- rhetinic acid competitively inhibits ATP binding to the enzyme and digitalis preparations inhibit the sodium pump by binding to its extracellular potassium binding site,6 there is the potential for similar effects on cardiac conduction. This patient\u2019s ECG abnormalities (in addition to those associated with hypokalemia) may well mimic the classic toxic effects seen with digitalis, with regularization of atrial fibrillation and alternat- ing fascicular block.\nSome of the traditionally prescribed initial pharmacologic interventions used for resuscita- tions that were also used in this patient may have aggravated his condition. The use of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, and vasopressin could have exacerbated the effects of 11\u03b2HSD2 blockade. The conversion to mechani- cal resuscitation allowed this patient to avoid possible metabolic side effects of potent inotropes and vasoconstrictors while providing tandem and synchronized cardiac support. Intravenous calcium chloride, as well as dextrose and insu- lin, could have made this patient\u2019s hypokalemia worse and led to his transient hypercalcemia, which, in a patient with a disordered metabolic presentation that was complicated by chronic mal- nutrition, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglycemia, exacerbated the overall effect. Persistent hyper- calcemia was not observed in this patient, and indeed, the level of ionized calcium was normal, even with markedly elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus. The patient\u2019s initial potassium level of 3.5 mmol per liter was probably spurious,given that the sample had hemolyzed; the level was most likely lower (as low as 1.6 mmol per liter). Later, when hypertension was observed, the patient was treated with a calcium-channel block- er \u2014 a drug class that traditionally has been viewed as having minimal effects on the blood potassium level and in fact may raise levels and drive the ion intracellularly. Therapeutic tempera- ture management, which was not implemented in this patient, might well have driven potassium levels even lower.\nA precise diagnosis of hypokalemia due to \n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Anand S. Dighe: In a random urine sample, the sodium level was 119 mmol per liter, the potas- sium level 13.8 mmol per liter, the chloride level 98 mmol per liter, and the creatinine level 0.06 g per liter. The elevated ratio of potassium to cre- atinine in the urine (230 mmol of potassium per gram of creatinine) was suggestive of renal po- tassium loss, since a ratio greater than 13 mmol of potassium per gram of creatinine is associated with renal potassium wasting. It should be not- ed that the ratio of potassium to creatinine may not be reliable in the context of acute kidney injury.8 Certain types of diuretics can cause or exacerbate renal potassium losses. However, an assay that evaluated the presence of several com- mon loop and thiazide diuretics in the urine was negative.\nMeasurement of plasma renin activity and the\nserum aldosterone level was performed to assess for the presence of mineralocorticoid excess. Plasma renin activity was evaluated with the use of an assay that measures the ability of endoge- nous renin to act on endogenous angiotensino- gen in vitro to form angiotensin I. The plasma renin activity was undetectable (<0.4 ng per mil- liliter per hour; reference range, \u22640.6 to 3.0). The serum aldosterone level, measured by means of high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, was also below the level of detection (<4.0 ng per deciliter; reference range,\n\u226421).  Taken  together, the low aldosterone level\nand the low renin activity provide no evidence of either primary hyperaldosteronism (in which the aldosterone level is elevated and the renin level is low) or secondary hyperaldosteronism (in which both the aldosterone level and the renin level are elevated).\nIn a random urine sample, the level of urinary free cortisol was highly elevated at 1857 \u03bcg per gram of creatinine (reference range, 1 to 119). Measurement of urine cortisol and cortisone levels may assist in the diagnosis of inherited or acquired abnormalities of 11\u03b2HSD2. The ratio of urinary cortisol to cortisone would be expected to be elevated in the case of deficiency or inhibi- tion (e.g., by licorice metabolites) of 11\u03b2HSD2 ac- tivity, which would reduce the conversion of corti- sol to cortisone. It is recommended that the assessment of urine cortisol and cortisone levels be based on a 24-hour urine specimen owing to the pulsatile nature of cortisol secretion. The ability to measure glycyrrhetinic acid metabolites in both the blood and urine has been reported, and such testing may be available at specialized laboratories.9 Glycyrrhetinic acid metabolite test- ing was not performed in this case.\n",
