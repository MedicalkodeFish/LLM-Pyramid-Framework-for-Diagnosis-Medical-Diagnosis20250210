    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Diana L. Stern (Psychiatry): A 65-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of depression, recurrent falls, and difficulty caring for herself.\nFour years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of depression that was precipitated by psychosocial stressors. She was treated with bupropion, citalopram, and cognitive behavioral therapy. The depression was well controlled until 1 year before the current admission, when she began to have an- hedonia, decreased energy, sadness, and poor concentration. She resumed cogni- tive behavioral therapy, but her symptoms worsened during the next 4 months, and she had suicidal ideation. The dose of bupropion was increased, and treatment with trazodone was started.\nFourteen weeks before the current admission, the patient was in a motor ve- hicle accident that was attributed to her falling asleep while driving. After the accident, she reported increased sadness, low energy, and inability to perform her usual activities. One week later, she fell and struck her head, and she was evalu- ated in the emergency department of this hospital. She reported that, before her fall, she had been feeling unsteady because of weakness in the left leg. A physical examination was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed hypodensi- ties involving the subcortical and periventricular white matter, findings consistent with chronic small-vessel disease. The patient was referred to the neurology clinic of this hospital and was discharged home.\nDuring the next week, the patient had balance difficulties and began using a walker. When she was evaluated in the neurology clinic, she reported imbalance and occasional nausea. On examination, she had a depressed affect. Strength was assessed  as  5\u2212/5  in  the  proximal  and  distal  muscles  of  the  arms  and  legs.  Re- flexes were 1+ and symmetric at the biceps, triceps, and patellar tendons and were absent at the ankles, with downgoing toes. The gait was wide-based and unsteady, with mild dragging of the left leg. A diagnosis of post- concussive syndrome was considered, and treat- ment with ondansetron was started for nausea. Additional tests were performed.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed after the administration of in- travenous contrast material, revealed increased signal intensity in the pons and in a periventricu- lar distribution on T2-weighted imaging, with- out associated contrast enhancement. There was a region of decreased signal intensity in the right corona radiata on a map of the apparent diffu- sion coefficient. Results of electroencephalogra- phy were normal, as were results of electromy- ography and nerve-conduction studies of the left leg. Physical therapy was recommended, and repeat MRI was planned for 6 weeks later.\nOver the next 6-week period, during sessions\nof cognitive behavioral therapy, the patient was noted to be less talkative, with slow processing, impaired recall, and mild inattention. Repeat MRI with angiography performed 6 weeks after the first study revealed patchy hyperintensity involving the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract bilater- ally on T2-weighted f luid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, without contrast en- hancement; the cerebral vasculature was normal. The patient had recurrent falls without loss of consciousness and began using a wheelchair. She reported worsening sadness, anxiety, and anhedonia, and treatment with buspirone was started. On evaluation in the neurology clinic 6 weeks before the current admission, testing of leg strength yielded inconsistent results, but strength in both legs was assessed as 5\u2212/5 with maximum effort. Dragging of the left leg was also noted to be inconsistent. There were con- cerns that her depression might be contributing to her neurologic changes, and further follow-up\nwith the psychiatric service was recommended.\nFive weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s husband brought her to the emergency department of this hospital for an evaluation of worsening memory impairment, poor self-care, and frequent falls. The patient had stopped par- ticipating in physical therapy and was spending most of the day in bed. She reported that she had lost 14 kg during the previous 4 months.\nOther medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and osteoarthritis of the knees. There was a history of postpartum depression 27 years earlier that had lasted for several months. Medi- cations included amlodipine, buspirone, bupro- pion, cholecalciferol, citalopram, metformin, and trazodone. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived with her husband in a suburb of Boston and worked as a teacher. She was a lifelong nonsmoker, drank alcohol only occasion- ally, and did not use illicit drugs. Her mother had a history of anxiety and depression in her seventh decade of life. Her sister had a history of stroke.\nOn examination, the patient appeared tired and disheveled, with psychomotor retardation. Strength  in  both  legs  was  assessed  as  5/5.  She had a monoplegic gait, with buckling of the left leg, when walking down a hallway, but she had a normal gait when walking on a treadmill. Her score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was 25, indicating mild cognitive impairment; scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicat- ing better cognitive function. The complete blood count, results of liver-function and kidney-func- tion tests, and blood levels of cobalamin, thyro- tropin, and electrolytes were normal. Screening for syphilis, Lyme disease, and the human im- munodeficiency virus was negative, as was urine toxicologic screening. After an evaluation by a neurology consultant, the patient was voluntarily admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, the dose of citalopram was tapered, and treatment with desvenlafaxine and amphetamine\u2013dextro- amphetamine was started; her levels of attention and wakefulness increased. She participated in group psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral ther- apy, and occupational and physical therapy. She continued to have variable weakness in the left leg and had three witnessed falls, during which she reportedly had fatigue and lowered herself to the ground.\nOn hospital day 11, the patient reported be- ing unable to use her left arm because of weak- ness. Although her left arm rested across her chest for most of the day, she was observed holding her husband\u2019s hand with her left hand when saying goodbye. On evaluation by a neu- rology consultant, strength in the left arm was assessed as 5/5. The working diagnosis was functional neurologic disorder. On hospital day 12, the patient was discharged to a rehabilita- tion center.\nAt the rehabilitation center, the patient re- ceived physical, occupational, and speech ther- apy, as well as medications to treat depression. During the first week, she made progress toward independence in bathing, toileting, and groom- ing but had limited attention, memory, and problem solving. During the second week, she became more withdrawn. There was a paucity of speech with hypophonia, decreased attention, and less eye contact with visitors who sat on her left side than with visitors who sat on her right side. During the third week, the patient stopped answering questions and following commands. She was evaluated again in the emergency de- partment of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 141/90 mm Hg, the pulse 98 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. She was withdrawn and minimally interactive. She was able to state her name but not the date or loca- tion. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side and did not track the examiner\u2019s finger past the midline to the left. There was f lattening of the left nasolabial fold. The left arm was hypertonic and held in flexion; there was no spontaneous movement of the left arm or leg, and she declined to participate in a strength examination. She did not withdraw the left arm in response to nail-bed pressure; she withdrew the left foot with antigravity movement in re- sponse to tactile stimulation.\nThe white-cell count was 12,940 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 11,000), with a normal differential count. The remainder of the complete blood count was normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and blood levels of electrolytes.\nA diagnostic test was performed.\n\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Deborah A. Forst: I was involved in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagnosis in this case. This 65-year-old woman with a history of depression presented with worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms, weight loss, unsteady gait, and progression of weakness on the left side for several months. MRI of the head had revealed nonspecific findings. The patient re- ceived a diagnosis of functional neurologic dis- order and was treated with inpatient psychiatric care, followed by rehabilitation. While she was at the rehabilitation center, she had progressive neurologic decline, which led to another evalu- ation in the emergency department of this hospital.\nI will begin by considering the previous diag- nosis of functional neurologic disorder. I will then discuss neuroanatomical localization and outline potential causes of this patient\u2019s illness.\nFunctional Neurologic Disorder\nThis patient was initially thought to have func- tional neurologic disorder, a primary neuropsy- chiatric illness with neurologic manifestations. Her preexisting psychiatric disorder and the findings on physical examination supported this diagnosis. She was witnessed to have knee buck- ling with ambulation, which is commonly re- ported in patients with functional neurologic disorder.6 She also had varying motor function in different settings; such motor inconsistency is reported to be 85.3 to 99.9% specific for func- tional neurologic disorder.6 However, because she had progressive neurologic decline at the rehabilitation center and markedly abnormal results on neurologic examination in the emer- gency department, her current presentation is more likely to be due to neuropsychiatric symp- toms related to a primary progressive neurologic illness.\n\nPrimary Progressive Neurologic Illness\nNeuroanatomical Localization\nIn evaluating any patient with a suspected pri- mary neurologic illness, the first step is to local- ize the symptoms along the neuraxis (Fig. 1). This patient\u2019s initial symptoms, including uni- lateral leg weakness with a monoplegic gait and hyporeflexia in both legs, could be indicative of a process involving the peripheral nervous sys- tem (PNS). However, the results of electromyography and nerve-conduction studies of the affected leg were unremarkable, findings that argue against a primary PNS process. Although the depressed reflexes in the legs are consistent with some degree of PNS dysfunction, the history of diabetes suggests an alternative cause of dia- betic peripheral neuropathy, which may be unre- lated to the current presentation.\nFurthermore, the patient had signs and symp- toms that were suggestive of a process involving the central nervous system (CNS). She had pro- gressive spastic hemiparesis involving the face, arm, and leg on the left side, which localizes to the CNS on the right side, above the level of the facial nucleus. She had evidence of withdrawal, abulia, and anhedonia, features associated with frontal lobe involvement. She also had a right- gaze preference, which could suggest an inacti- vating lesion in the right frontal eye fields. There were findings suggestive of left hemineglect, which occurs in patients with right parietal dys- function. She did not blink in response to threat on the left side; the absence of this response is consistent with either left hemineglect or left hemianopsia, the latter of which could be asso- ciated with a right retrochiasmal lesion. Ulti- mately, her neurologic signs and symptoms lo- calize to the right frontal and parietal cortical and subcortical regions.\nThe differential diagnosis of diseases that\nmay manifest with prominent neuropsychiatric symptoms is broad. In this patient, the list can be narrowed to diseases that manifest with sub- acute, progressive CNS decline with prominent neuropsychiatric manifestations, focal neurologic signs, and nonspecific MRI findings.\n\nNeurodegenerative Diseases\nAlthough genetic disorders that affect the white matter of the CNS classically develop in infancy or childhood, this patient could have an adult- onset leukodystrophy, such as Krabbe disease, vanishing white matter disease, or metachro- matic leukodystrophy.7,8 Adult-onset Krabbe dis- ease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by \u03b2-galactocerebrosidase defi- ciency. Patients often present with spastic para- paresis or tetraparesis and with cognitive decline. MRI typically reveals hyperintensity involving the proximal corticospinal tract, optic radiation, and splenium or isthmus of the corpus callosum bilaterally on T2-weighted imaging, features that\n \ncould align with the nonspecific early MRI find- ings observed in this patient. However, the pa- tient was older than would be expected for this diagnosis.7-9\nAnother possible explanation for this pa- tient\u2019s presentation is CADASIL (cerebral autoso- mal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical in- farcts and leukoencephalopathy). CADASIL is the most common hereditary cause of cerebral small-vessel disease; it could be consistent with her sister\u2019s history of stroke. Focal neurologic signs, cognitive dysfunction, and neuropsychiat- ric symptoms are common presenting features of CADASIL. However, MRI did not reveal changes in the white matter at the temporal poles and external capsule, which are commonly seen in patients with this disease.10\n\nInfection\nFocal neurologic and neuropsychiatric symp- toms, as well as nonspecific MRI findings, can occur in patients with indolent fungal infections such as cryptococcosis or aspergillosis11; viral infections such as JC virus infection, which causes progressive multifocal leukoencepha- lopathy12; or prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt\u2013 Jakob disease.13 In this patient, MRI did not re- veal findings typical of a fungal infection, such as abscess, space-occupying lesions, infarction, or hemorrhage from angioinvasion.11,14 She did not have impaired cellular immunity, a feature that would place her at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.12 In addition, her course was more protracted than would be expected with Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease.13\n\nCerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis\nCerebral venous sinus thrombosis is more com- mon in women than in men, may be precipitated by head trauma, and can have a subacute course; 7 to 20% of patients present with symptoms that have lasted for more than 1 month.15-18 Although head trauma could have occurred in this patient during the motor vehicle accident, several aspects of her presentation make the diagnosis of cere- bral venous sinus thrombosis unlikely. She did not report headache, which is present in 80 to 90% of patients.16,17 She is older than the typical patient (a woman of childbearing age).15 The slow trajectory of her symptoms would be high- ly unusual, given that the median time from symptom onset to the diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is 7 days.16 Finally, the MRI findings were not suggestive of venous in- farction or thrombosis.\n\nAutoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases Autoimmune or inflammatory diseases of the CNS frequently have neurocognitive or neuro- psychiatric manifestations. Disorders to consid- er in this patient include multiple sclerosis, pri- mary angiitis of the CNS, and paraneoplastic encephalitis, although she did not have the classic presentation for any of these condi- tions.19-22 Neurosarcoidosis is an important con- sideration in this patient, given that it is asso- ciated with protean manifestations and varied imaging findings. Approximately 15% of pa- tients with neurosarcoidosis present with paren- chymal abnormalities, which were seen in this patient, and 60% of patients have depression.23 This patient had no known history of systemic sarcoidosis, but only 31% of patients with neu- rosarcoidosis have concomitant systemic disease at the time of diagnosis.23\n\nCancer\nThis patient\u2019s age, weight loss, and progressive course are suggestive of cancer. Patients with diffuse glioma or lymphoma involving the ner- vous system often present with insidious symp- toms, and nonspecific findings such as neuro- psychiatric symptoms may delay the diagnosis.24-26 However, the patchy bilateral hyperintensity ob- served on T2-weighted imaging in this patient is atypical of glioma.27,28 Of note, 40 to 50% of\n \n\n\n \nDr. R. Gilberto Gonzalez: MRI of the head revealed an extensive, confluent, expansile abnormality that was associated with contrast enhancement and with hyperintensity on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging (Fig. 2). The abnormality originated from the centrum semiovale bilaterally, involved the right and left cingulate gyri, and extended across the body of the corpus callosum. There was an additional expansile abnormality, also associated with contrast enhancement and with hyperintensity on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging, within the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, extending into the right corticospinal tract. These enhancing lesions showed hyperin- tensity on diffusion-weighted imaging and hypo- intensity on a map of the apparent diffusion coefficient, features that indicate reduced diffu- sivity. There was additional confluent hyperin- tensity on T2-weighted FLAIR imaging, without contrast enhancement, involving the frontopari- etal white matter, corpus callosum, basal gan- glia and thalamus, internal capsule, pons, and midbrain bilaterally.\nDr. Forst: The MRI findings were highly sug-\ngestive of CNS lymphoma. I recommended a brain biopsy as the next step in diagnostic test- ing. The biopsy was to be performed before the administration of glucocorticoids, which can partially treat lymphoma and decrease the diag- nostic yield of the biopsy.\n\nDiagnostic Procedure\n \npatients with primary CNS lymphoma present     \t\n \nwith neuropsychiatric, behavioral, or cognitive symptoms, and 50 to 70% of patients have focal neurologic deficits.29-31 The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis is 3 to 5 months; in one series, 10% of diagnoses were established after a year or more.31 On the basis of the fea- tures of this patient\u2019s presentation, I thought that CNS lymphoma was the most likely diagno- sis, although the absence of contrast enhance- ment on MRI would be rare.32 I recommended repeat MRI of the head with the administration of gadolinium as the next step in the evaluation of this patient.\n\n\n\n\n",

MRI of the Head.\nWhen the patient returned to the emergency department after progressive neurologic decline occurred at the rehabilitation center, MRI of the head was performed. Multiple sequences were obtained at the level of the centrum semiovale. A T2\u2011weighted fluid\u2011attenuated in\u2011 version recovery (FLAIR) image (Panel A) shows an abnormality associated with two levels of increased signal intensity within the white matter, with higher signal intensity in the periphery. A T1\u2011weighted image obtained after the administration of gadolinium (Panel B) shows intense contrast enhancement in the central portion of the abnormality, with surrounding nonenhancing hypointensity. A diffu\u2011 sion\u2011weighted image (Panel C) shows reduced diffusivity in the central portion of the abnormality. This contrast\u2011enhancing mass with surrounding edema has features characteristic of primary lymphoma of the central nervous system.\n",
