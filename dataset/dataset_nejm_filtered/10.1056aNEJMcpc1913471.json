    "Primary Symptom": "A 52-Year-Old Woman with Seizure Disorder and Wide-Complex Tachycardia",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Nino Mihatov: A 52-year-old woman was evaluated for a new wide-complex tachy- cardia that developed while she was hospitalized for the management of seizures.\nFive days before the development of tachycardia, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with tonic\u2013clonic seizure activity. Six days before the current ad- mission, she had been discharged from this hospital after a prolonged hospitaliza- tion in the neurosciences intensive care unit (ICU) for refractory status epilepticus. At the time of discharge, she was transferred to a skilled nursing facility for transitional care. Two days after transfer, she had a fall with a reportedly mild head injury; no further evaluation was done.\nOn the morning of the current admission, the patient had a focal seizure at the skilled nursing facility and diazepam was administered intravenously. After she had another seizure, emergency medical services were contacted. She had a total of seven tonic\u2013clonic seizures, each of which lasted up to 90 seconds. On arrival of emergency medical services, the trachea was intubated and then the patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital.\nAfter evaluation in the emergency department, the patient was admitted to the neurosciences ICU. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained on admission (Fig. 1A). Propofol, midazolam, and phenobarbital were administered intrave- nously, and clobazam, felbamate, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine were administered through an orogastric tube. Computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no intracranial abnormality. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring showed ongoing seizure activity; on the second day, boluses of pentobarbital were admin- istered intravenously. Central venous and arterial catheters were placed so that norepinephrine could be administered to maintain the mean arterial pressure. On the third day, a transient junctional cardiac rhythm was noted, and the administra- tion of pentobarbital boluses was stopped. Periods of sinus bradycardia and ven- tricular bigeminy were subsequently noted.\nDr. Karen A. Buch: On the fourth day, positron-emission tomography (PET) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head were performed. There were ill defined subcortical and cortical hyperintensities in the left occipital lobe on T2-weighted MRI, which corresponded to an area of 18F-f luorode- oxyglucose avidity seen on previous PET (Fig. 2). Dr. Mihatov: On the fifth day, ECG abnormali- ties were noted (Fig. 1B). Late that evening, the temperature was 38.4\u00b0C and additional norepi- nephrine was given. Four hours later, P waves were thought to be absent on telemetric moni- toring (Fig. 1C). In addition, the QRS complex was noted to be wide, and urgent cardiology\nconsultation was obtained (Fig. 1D).\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for seizure disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and bipolar disorder. Her admission to the neurosciences ICU of this hospital for refrac- tory status epilepticus had begun 3 months earlier. During that admission, PET of the head and EEG suggested a causative focus in the left occipital lobe; other evaluation (a paraneoplastic antibody panel, assessment for infection, lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis, toxi- cologic screening, and testing for other anti- bodies, including antinuclear antibodies) was unrevealing. Tracheostomy and gastrostomy were performed as part of the prolonged ICU stay, during which deep sedation was administered to suppress seizure activity. The patient underwent trials of multiple antiepileptic medications: phenytoin caused bradycardia and ventricular bi- geminy, and valproic acid was discontinued be- cause of elevated aminotransferase and ammonia levels. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was performed, and seizures were ultimately con- trolled with a combination of clobazam, felbamate, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and oxcarbazepine.\nMedications that the patient had been receiv- ing immediately before the current hospitaliza- tion included clobazam, felbamate, f luoxetine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, nortriptyline, oxcar- bazepine, prazosin, and folic acid, as well as diazepam and quetiapine as needed. There were no other known adverse reactions to medications. Medications that the patient was receiving at the time of the cardiology consultation included intravenous infusions of propofol, midazolam, and pentobarbital; intravenous vancomycin and piperacillin\u2013tazobactam; subcutaneous enoxapa- rin injection; and enteral clobazam, felbamate, fluoxetine, lacosamide, levetiracetam, oxcarbaze- pine, folic acid, senna, polyethylene glycol, and multivitamins.\nThe patient had been hospitalized nearly continuously for the previous 4 months. She had two children. She had smoked 1 pack of ciga- rettes weekly for 20 years and had previously consumed alcohol heavily; she also had previ- ously used nonprescribed benzodiazepines. The family history was negative for neurologic and cardiac disease.\nOn examination, the patient was intubated, sedated, and unresponsive. The temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 98 beats per minute, the blood  pressure  106/56  mm  Hg  while  she  was receiving norepinephrine, and the oxygen satu- ration 99% while she was receiving pressure- controlled mechanical ventilation at a rate of 18 breaths per minute (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.60; inspiratory pressure, 12 cm of water; expi- ratory pressure, 10 cm of water). The pupils were symmetric and sluggish. Further assessment of neurologic function was limited. The heart sounds were distant, and there was no detectable mur- mur. Bowel sounds were present. The arms and legs were cool.\nBlood levels of alanine aminotransferase, ammonia, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and triglyceride were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Additional ECGs showed a wide-QRS-complex rhythm of uncertain mechanism. A bedside cardiac ultrasound examination showed diffuse global hypokinesis of the left ventricle.\n\nFigure 1 (facing page). Serial Electrocardiograms.\nAn electrocardiogram obtained on admission (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, a normal axis, normal intervals, and a borderline low QRS\u2011complex amplitude in the limb leads. On the morning of the fifth hospital day (Panel B), the rhythm is still originating from the sinus node and the limb\u2011lead voltages remain diminished; however, the QRS complex is slightly wider, and exten\u2011 sive repolarization changes are evident, most notably across the precordium (leads V2 to V3), with ST\u2011seg\u2011 ment elevation. A telemetry strip obtained late on the fifth hospital day (Panel C) shows sinus rhythm (P waves seen in lead III), but with prolonged atrioventricular conduction, as well as diffuse dramatic ST\u2011segment elevation, with near fusion of the ST segment with the QRS complex, which remains slightly wide. Early on the morning of sixth hospital day, at the time cardiol\u2011 ogy consultation was requested (Panel D), the under\u2011 lying rhythm is less clear but is regularly irregular; the QRS complex is wide and more difficult to separate from the ST segment. On the 15th hospital day (Panel E), the patient has a normal sinus rhythm with a normal\u2011 ized QRS\u2011complex width and PR interval; inferoapical repolarization abnormalities are present.\n\nFigure 2. Imaging Studies of the Head.\nAxial MRI images were obtained on the current admission. A diffusion\u2011weighted image shows a focus of restricted diffusion (Panel A, arrow), which corresponds to hyperintensity on a T2\u2011weighted fluid\u2011attenuated inversion recov\u2011 ery image (Panel B, arrow) and to subtle enhancement on a contrast\u2011enhanced image (Panel C, arrow). An axial positron\u2011emission tomographic (PET) image of the head obtained on the current admission did not show evidence of corresponding hypermetabolism, but an axial PET image of the head obtained 3 months before the current ad\u2011 mission shows increased 18F\u2011fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in both occipital lobes, greater on the left side than on the right side (Panel D, arrow).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Daniel B. Kramer: This 52-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder and PTSD recently had an extended hospital stay for refractory status epilepticus, ultimately receiving a five-drug regi- men for control of overt seizures before discharge to a rehabilitation facility. She presents with re- current seizure activity, fever, hypotension that has led to vasopressor support, left occipital abnor- malities on MRI, evolving ECG abnormalities,   and diffuse global ventricular hypokinesis. At the time of initial evaluation, there are three key ques- tions: Is the cardiac rhythm atrial or ventricular in origin? What is responsible for the observed abnormalities? What are the implications of the diagnosis for her immediate treatment?\n\nEvolution of ECG Abnormalities\nSeveral clues about this patient\u2019s condition emerge from reviewing the evolution of her ECG abnor- malities over time. On the first hospital day, her ECG shows sinus rhythm, a normal axis, normal intervals, and a borderline low QRS-complex amplitude in the limb leads and is otherwise unremarkable (Fig. 1A). On the morning of the fifth hospital day, the rhythm is still originating from the sinus node and limb-lead voltages re- main diminished; however, the QRS complex is slightly wider, at 120 msec (normal range, 80 to 100), and extensive repolarization changes are evident, most notably across the precordium (leads V2 to V3), with slight ST-segment elevation (Fig. 1B). Over the course of the fifth hospital day, the telemetric tracing becomes strikingly abnormal (Fig. 1C). The patient remains in sinus rhythm with P waves seen in lead III, but with prolonged atrioventricular conduction. There is diffuse and dramatic ST-segment elevation, with near fusion of the ST segment with the QRS complex, which remains slightly wide. At the time that the cardiology consultation is request- ed, the underlying rhythm is less clear but is regularly irregular and the QRS complex is wide and more difficult to distinguish from the ST segment (Fig. 1D).\n\nGeneral Approach to Wide-Complex Tachycardias\nThe differential diagnosis for a patient with a wide-QRS-complex rhythm includes ventricular tachycardia, preexcited tachycardias (including antidromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachy- cardia and any supraventricular tachycardia with passive conduction over an accessory pathway), supraventricular tachycardia with fixed or func- tional aberrant conduction, and effects of drug use or abnormal electrolyte levels. For distin- guishing the mechanism, there are several pub- lished algorithms1-3 that differ slightly in their approaches but generally focus on three key questions (Fig. 3): What is the atrioventricular relationship? Is the vector of ventricular activa- tion more consistent with ventricular activation or with supraventricular activation? Is the initial activation of the myocardium consistent with conduction through specialized tissue or with myocyte\u2013myocyte conduction?\n \n\nIn a patient with sinus rhythm, interrogating the atrioventricular relationship may help to iden- tify atrioventricular dissociation, in which P waves can be identified marching through the QRS complexes. This finding would usually be diag- nostic of ventricular tachycardia. Occasionally, in a patient with relatively slow ventricular tachy- cardia (particularly ventricular tachycardia with a rate of <150 beats per minute), it may be pos- sible to see capture beats or fusion beats, which occur when a fortuitously timed P wave conducts and activates the ventricles either fully or par- tially and produces a corresponding QRS com- plex that is consistent with the sinus complex seen in this patient or with a hybrid of sinus and ventricular tachycardia. In addition, several key patterns are useful for characterizing the vector of ventricular activation in a way that distin- guishes supraventricular origin from ventricular origin in a wide-QRS-complex rhythm. For exam- ple, an initial positive deflection in lead aVR, indicating an extreme rightward axis of initial ventricular activation, is generally incompatible with a supraventricular rhythm.1 Morphologic ap- pearances in leads V1 and V6 that are character- istic of either ventricular or supraventricular rhythm can also be exploited as patterns arising from vectors of activation that are consistent with only one mechanism or the other.\nFinally, the initial component of the QRS complex can be examined to determine whether the initial forces are more consistent with con- duction through the His\u2013Purkinje system and bundle branches or with myocyte\u2013myocyte con- duction. The conduction velocity through the specialized pathway is approximately 10 times the myocyte\u2013myocyte conduction velocity. Supra- ventricular tachycardia with aberration will con- duct over one of the functioning bundle branch- es, and thus the initial activation (upstroke or downstroke of the QRS complex) will appear rapid. In contrast, in ventricular tachycardia, the initial forces will manifest with a \u201cslurred\u201d QRS complex, which is caused by the relatively slow myocyte\u2013myocyte conduction that occurs outside the specialized conduction pathway. For exam- ple, in supraventricular rhythms with aberration, the initial R-wave duration in lead V1 or V2 is typically less than 30 msec, and the time from the onset to the nadir (deepest negative inscrip- tion) of the QRS complex is less than 60 msec, because conduction down the right bundle branch occurs normally. In contrast, in ventricular tachy-cardia, the R-wave duration is wider and the time from the onset to the nadir of the QRS complex is longer.4\nOf note, these guiding principles can be chal- lenging to apply in cases of ventricular rhythms that arise close to or make use of specialized conduction tissue, such as bundle-branch reentry or fascicular tachycardia, or in cases in which antiarrhythmic drugs or electrolyte abnormali- ties slow conduction in both specialized conduc- tion tissue and the myocardium. Acidemia, hyper- kalemia, and medications affecting ion-channel function can cause depolarization and repolar- ization abnormalities that do not conform easily to the algorithmic patterns, and such influences can act cumulatively or synergistically. In these cases, pattern recognition can be more difficult, and comparison of ECGs with previous studies and clinical correlation may be critical.\n\nECG Interpretation\nBy the fifth hospital day, this patient\u2019s ECGs show a pattern of repolarization abnormality with J-point and ST-segment elevation across leads V2, V3, and V4 that resembles the Brugada syndrome (Fig. 1B). The Brugada syndrome is an inherited arrhythmia that is associated with loss- of-function mutations in sodium channels, which result in an epicardial\u2013endocardial repolarization gradient predominantly in the right ventricle,with a corresponding characteristic pattern of ST- segment elevation in the right precordial leads.5 This patient\u2019s ECGs show similar morphologic features, but the changes involve multiple leads in addition to those in the right precordium and evolve over time. These findings would be con- sistent with toxic effects from the multiple anti- epileptic drugs that were administered to control the patient\u2019s seizures. The exact mechanism of action for these agents may be obscure, but all the agents interact with sodium or calcium chan- nels (or both) and can cause ECG abnormalities.Of note, some patients with underlying mutations in sodium ion channels have a Brugada- like ECG pattern when they are febrile; a muta- tion of this type may be a contributing factor in this case, since the patient was febrile on pre- sentation and has not had these ECG changes previously, despite use of similar medications. In addition, profound toxic effects from sodium- channel blockers can cause decreased myocar- dial contractility, a feature consistent with the echocardiographic findings in this case.\nInspection of the most recent ECG shows a regularly irregular rhythm with grouped beating (Fig. 1D). In lead V1, P waves can be seen throughout the rhythm strip, but this finding is not consistent with atrioventricular dissociation, which would be diagnostic of a ventricular rhythm. Idioventricular rhythms are usually regular, so the findings on this ECG are more likely to re- flect sinus rhythm with delayed atrioventricular conduction that varies from beat to beat in a reproducible pattern. The vector of ventricular activation is similar to that seen in sinus rhythm and is compatible with supraventricular conduc- tion. The initial forces are slightly delayed, but the time from the onset to the nadir of the QRS complex in lead V1 is still relatively rapid and more  consistent  with  supraventricular conduction than with a ventricular rhythm. Taken together, the findings on this patient\u2019s ECG probably repre- sent sinus rhythm with alternating atrioventric- ular-conduction delay, QRS-complex widening, and diffuse ST-segment elevation \u2014 features reflective of antiepileptic drug toxicity.\nIt is important to recognize that if this pattern persists or progresses, it can result in a \u201csine wave\u201d pattern of QRS-complex activation and cardiovascular collapse from a lack of effective depolarization, impairing both conduction and contractility. In this context, resuscitation can be difficult because the offending agents remain active and progressive acid\u2013base and electrolyte per- turbation may worsen conduction. Similarly, emer- gency temporary transvenous or transcutaneous pacing is typically not effective, because neither intervention can overcome the ion-channel block- ade to actually capture the myocardium reliably.\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Jeremy N. Ruskin: During the course of this patient\u2019s hospitalization, she has received 15 medications, many of which have been adminis- tered for seizure control. Among these, felba- mate, lacosamide, oxcarbazepine, pentobarbital, and propofol all inhibit neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels and are capable of blocking the SCN5A-encoded cardiac sodium channel.6 Cardiac sodium channels carry the depolarizing inward current that is responsible for the rapid upstroke (phase 0) of the action potential, which, when summated for all ventricular myocytes, is re- f lected in the duration of the QRS complex on ECG. Sodium-channel\u2013blocking drugs bind to transmembrane sodium channels and reduce the number of channels that are available for depo- larization. As more sodium channels are blocked by drugs or heart muscle disease (or a combina- tion of the two), less sodium can enter the cell and the rate of impulse propagation through the ventricles is slowed, which is reflected in progres- sive prolongation of the QRS-complex duration. In addition to having progressive widening of the QRS complex, this patient had increasing de- grees of J-point and ST-segment elevation, which ultimately involved a wide spatial distribution, including the inferior, lateral, and anterior pre- cordial leads. This finding is consistent with a global early repolarization pattern. Early repolar- ization is an ECG pattern defined as an elevation of more than 0.1 mV of the junction between the QRS complex and the ST segment (J point) in two or more contiguous leads (most commonly in an inferior or lateral distribution), as well as a QRS duration of less than 120 msec and, in some patients, associated terminal notching or slurring of the QRS complex.7 This ECG pattern may be seen in up to 13% of the general popula- tion and is a benign finding in most cases.8 However, in a few cases, early repolarization may be associated with an increased risk of ar- rhythmic death or, in particular, with an in- creased risk of otherwise unexplained (idiopathic) polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricu- lar fibrillation.9 The rare clinical combination of early repolarization on ECG and a propensity for life-threatening arrhythmias is known as the early repolarization syndrome.\nIn this patient, other potential explanations for the early repolarization pattern on ECG include acute ischemia, hypothermia, athlete\u2019s heart, peri- carditis, intracerebral hemorrhage, takotsubo car- diomyopathy, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. These other explanations can be ruled out on the basis of a combination of clinical, ECG, and laboratory findings. It is interesting to note that this patient had reportedly been taking four oral agents with known sodium-channel\u2013blocking properties (felbamate, lacosamide, nortriptyline, and oxcarbazepine) immediately before the cur- rent hospital admission, apparently without ECG evidence of cardiac toxic effects. The marked cardiotoxicity observed during this hospitaliza- tion may have resulted from the addition of in- travenous pentobarbital and propofol to three other oral sodium-channel\u2013blocking anticonvul- sant agents. Parenteral administration typically results in greater drug exposures and increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects. Propo- fol is capable of exacerbating J waves, sometimes even with a single dose, probably as a result of blockade of both inward sodium and L-type cal- cium currents.10,11 In addition, the patient had a temperature of 38.4\u00b0C late on the night of the fifth hospital day, which coincides with the time that striking J-point elevations in lead V2 first\nappeared on her ECG. Fever may exacerbate pre-\nexisting sodium-channel dysfunction and also enhance the effects of some sodium-channel\u2013 blocking drugs. Although the effect of sodium- channel\u2013blocking drugs may be variable in pa- tients with early repolarization syndrome, the use of such drugs has been reported to exacerbate ECG abnormalities and ventricular arrhythmias in some patients with early repolarization syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation resulting from loss-of-function mutations in SCN5A.12\nThus, the unusual ECG patterns in this pa- tient are best explained by the emergence of a global early repolarization pattern unmasked by an exaggerated response to sodium-channel\u2013 blocking medications and are possibly due to the presence of an underlying sodium-channel (SCN5A) mutation. This hypothesis would explain the pro- gressively marked J-point and ST-segment eleva- tions that are consistent with global early repo- larization, as well as the presence of progressive widening of the QRS complex, which is a com- mon feature of sodium-channel\u2013blocker toxicity. The presence of first-degree atrioventricular block, which is seen in this patient, is a common ECG finding in patients with loss-of-function muta- tions in genes that are associated with the car- diac sodium channel (e.g., SCN5A and SCN14B) and adds further credence to the hypothesis that this patient has an underlying mutation of this type.\n\n",
