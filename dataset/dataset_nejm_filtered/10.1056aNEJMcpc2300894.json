    "Primary Symptom": "A 19-Year-Old Woman with Dyspnea and Tachypnea",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jacquelyn M. Nestor (Medicine): A 19-year-old woman was transferred to this hospital because of respiratory failure.\nThe patient had been in her usual state of health until 3 weeks before the cur- rent presentation, when pain developed in the right shoulder and the right flank. She was evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital and was dis- charged home after testing for kidney stones and appendicitis was reportedly negative.\nTwo weeks before the current presentation, dyspnea with exertion and nonpro- ductive cough developed. Six days after the onset of dyspnea and cough, the patient departed on a vacation cruise with her family. During the 8-day trip, dyspnea and cough worsened and prevented her from participating in activities such as swim- ming and hiking. By the end of the cruise, she had severe dyspnea with walking, and she required the use of a wheelchair during her trip home. After returning to Massachusetts, she presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for evaluation.\nThe patient reported ongoing cough and progressively worsening dyspnea but no chest pain or hemoptysis. The temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 132 beats per minute, the blood pressure 133/47 mm Hg, the respiratory rate more than 40 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 88% while she was breath- ing ambient air. She appeared ill and had increased work of breathing. A murmur was heard on cardiac examination; other details of the examination are not avail- able. An electrocardiogram (ECG) reportedly showed sinus tachycardia and lateral and precordial T-wave inversions. Urinalysis results and blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; the blood level of N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 24,913 pg per milliliter (reference range, 5 to 125). Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were obtained.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material according to a pulmonary embolism protocol, reportedly revealed pericardial and pleural effusions and multifocal lung opacities but no evidence of pulmonary emboli. Point-of-care ultrasonogra- phy reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, marked aortic regurgitation, and a possible aortic-root abscess. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula. Treatment with intravenous furo- semide, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and azithro- mycin was started. The patient was transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit of this hospital. On arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient received bilevel positive airway pres- sure. A family member accompanying the pa- tient provided additional history. The patient had had intermittent back pain beginning 6 months before the current presentation. Two months be- fore the current presentation, she had had asymp- tomatic infection with severe acute respiratory\n \nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Five weeks before the current presentation, she had had a dental cleaning. During the cruise, the patient had two episodes of diarrhea without fever or chills; the family member did not know whether other persons on the cruise had been ill. The patient had told her family that she had noticed visible pulsations in her chest during the 2 weeks before the current presentation, and the family member reported that the patient\u2019s breathing had appeared labored while she was sleeping.\nOther medical history included anxiety and anemia. The patient took supplemental iron and had no known drug allergies. She did not use alcohol, tobacco, or other substances. She lived with her family in Massachusetts and worked in child care. There was no family history of car- diac or autoimmune disease.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the heart rate 118 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/58 mm Hg in the right arm and 136/65 mm Hg in the left arm, the respiratory rate 48 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was receiving bilevel positive airway pressure (fraction of inspired oxygen, 0.70). The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 21.6. While the patient was sitting  in an upright position, she had increased work  of breathing and intermittent cough. The heart rhythm was tachycardic, with a grade 2/6 sys- tolic murmur at the base and a grade 3/4 decre- scendo diastolic murmur at the base that radi- ated to the apex, without an S3 gallop. Carotid and subclavian bruits were present. The jugular venous pressure was 8 cm of water. There were rales and decreased breath sounds in both lungs. Brachial, ulnar, radial, dorsalis pedis, and pos- terior tibial pulses were symmetric. The remain- der of the examination was normal.\nThe blood levels of glucose, electrolytes, thyro- tropin, lipase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of liver function and kidney function. A urine toxicology screening test was negative. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 77 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 20), and the  blood level of C-reactive protein was 147.8 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures were ob- tained. Tests for SARS-CoV-2 and human immu- nodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 were negative.\nDr. Eric M. Isselbacher: An ECG (Fig. 1A) showed\nsinus tachycardia, a borderline rightward axis, poor R-wave progression in leads V1 through V4, and  nonspecific  ST-segment  and  T-wave  ab-\nnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography (Fig. 1B through 1F and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) revealed a mildly dilated left ventri- cle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%. The aortic valve was tricuspid, without evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess, but there was incomplete closure of the aortic valve, which resulted in severe aortic re- gurgitation. The ascending thoracic aorta was dilated, measuring 44 mm in diameter, with thickened walls. The dilated left ventricle caused tethering of the mitral valve, which resulted in mild-to-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild left  atrial  enlargement.  There  was  a moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of cardiac tamponade.\nDr. Vinit Baliyan: CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 2) showed an irregu- lar aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery. This imaging was performed with ECG gating, which allowed for the assessment of the aortic root. There was no evidence of a perivalvular abscess. However, circumferential wall thickening was present in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment. In addition, there was circumferential wall thickening in partially visualized proximal vessels of the aortic arch and in the abdominal aorta. The mural thickening of the aorta showed enhancement that was suggestive of active inflammation; this enhancement was most visible in the abdominal aorta. Other findings included cardiomegaly with a markedly dilated left ventricle, alveolar pulmonary edema, a small pericardial effusion, and bilateral small pleural effusions.\n\nFigure 1. Cardiac Studies.\nAn electrocardiogram obtained at the time of the current presentation (Panel A) shows sinus tachycardia, a border\u2011 line rightward axis, poor R\u2011wave progression in leads V1 through V4, and nonspecific ST\u2011segment and T\u2011wave ab\u2011 normalities. On transthoracic echocardiography performed at the time of the current presentation, a parasternal long\u2011axis view (Panel B) shows a dilated left ventricle (LV) and thickening of the aortic\u2011root walls (arrow). A parasternal short\u2011axis view of the aortic root (Panel C) shows a tricuspid aortic valve (AV) and thickening of the aortic\u2011root walls (arrows). An apical five\u2011chamber view (Panel D) shows a very large jet of severe aortic regurgitation (arrow). A suprasternal notch view with color Doppler (Panel E) shows holodiastolic flow rever\u2011 sal (arrow) in the descending thoracic aorta (DA). Con\u2011 tinuous\u2011wave Doppler tracing in the same suprasternal notch view (Panel F) confirms holodiastolic flow reversal (arrow), a finding that suggests severe aortic regurgita\u2011 tion. AA denotes aortic arch, AO aortic root, LA left atrium, RPA right pulmonary artery, and RV right ventricle.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Cory A. Perugino: This young woman presented with a subacute illness involving the lungs, mi- tral and aortic valves, myocardium, pericardium, and aorta that was characterized by inflamma- tory features. The first step in developing a differential diagnosis is to consider whether a multiorgan inflammatory process caused this patient\u2019s presentation or whether a primary in-   f lammatory process in the aorta could explain the valvular, cardiac, and pulmonary abnor- malities.\n\nValvular Disease\nOn echocardiography, both the aortic and mi- tral valves showed incomplete coaptation, but no vegetations or perforations were present and there was no leaflet thickening, which makes a thrombotic, infectious, or inflamma- tory valvular process unlikely. Instead, the patient\u2019s valvular abnormalities appear to be due to anatomical alterations in the adjacent tissues (i.e., left ventricular dilatation adjacent to the mitral valve and aortic-root dilatation adjacent to the aortic valve) that resulted in malcoaptation.\nMyocardial Disease\nThe myocardium showed evidence of impaired function with reduced ejection fraction, but the troponin T level was not elevated. Therefore, ischemia and myocarditis are unlikely causes of myocardial disease in this young woman. Al- though other causes of cardiomyopathy should be considered, I suspect that the impaired left ventricular function was instead due to volume overload resulting from acute valvular damage.\n\nPulmonary Disease\nGround-glass opacities, which would have sug- gested a primary vasculitis of the lung, were not observed on chest imaging, and the patient had no history of hemoptysis. Although she had had a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the combination of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions seen on chest imaging in the context of an elevated blood level of NT-proBNP and a reduced ejection fraction is most suggestive of pulmonary edema due to heart failure.\n\nAortic Disease\nCross-sectional imaging of the aorta revealed cir- cumferential wall thickening that was both con- tinuous and extensive and involved the ascend- ing thoracic aorta, aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta, as well as major branch vessels. The circumferential nature of this finding is highly suggestive of aortitis; by contrast, the presence of irregular, asymmetric wall thickening would have suggested  athero- sclerotic aortic disease. The multifocal areas of stenosis without associated atherosclerotic plaque or calcification could indicate chronic inflamma- tory tissue damage leading to vessel-wall fibrosis. The patient\u2019s presentation is most consistent with primary aortitis leading to valvular dam- age, myocardial dysfunction (heart failure), and pulmonary edema. The next step is to consider\nthe causes of aortitis.\n\nInfectious Aortitis\nIn this patient with findings indicative of aorti- tis, it is important to consider whether the disorder is due to an infectious or noninfectious process. Although infectious aortitis is uncom- mon, it is imperative to rule out infectious causes, since the diagnosis of infection would drastically alter the management of the patient\u2019s illness and misdiagnosis would have devastating consequences.\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms began shortly after a dental procedure, which prompts consideration of an odontogenic portal of entry, followed by hematogenous spread and seeding of tissues. However, there was no evidence of valvular veg- etations, perivalvular abscesses, or aortic-root abscesses that would suggest a primary infec- tious process. Moreover, the absence of fever in the context of such a fulminant presentation would be unusual if she had an infectious aorti- tis. Although the cross-sectional aortic imaging findings of circumferential wall thickening and contrast enhancement can occur with both in- fectious and noninfectious aortitis, it would be difficult to explain the continuous and extensive involvement of the aorta by infectious aortitis, which tends to be more regionally isolated.1 Syphilitic aortitis, a feature of tertiary syphilis, is exceedingly rare and is generally confined to the thoracic aorta and not associated with mul- tifocal stenoses or involvement of the major branch vessels of the aortic arch2; therefore, this diagnosis is highly unlikely in this patient.\n\nNoninfectious Aortitis\nNoninfectious aortitis is most often caused by a primary large-vessel vasculitis such as giant-cell arteritis or Takayasu\u2019s arteritis. Less often, non- infectious aortitis is caused by a systemic auto- immune disease process such as IgG4-related disease, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and others.3\n\nGiant-Cell Arteritis\nGiant-cell arteritis is the most common primary large-vessel vasculitis affecting the aorta and is characterized by granulomatous inflammation that typically affects the muscular layer, al- though all layers of the aorta can be inflamed.4 The presenting features of giant-cell arteritis vary depending on the vessels involved and can include localized headache, scalp tenderness, vision loss, and jaw claudication, as well as my- algias and symmetric stiffness of the shoulder and pelvic girdle (i.e., polymyalgia rheumatica).\nOn the basis of classification criteria,6 the mini- mum age at which giant-cell arteritis is diag- nosed is 50 years, and the median age is in the seventh or eighth decade of life.7-10 Therefore, giant-cell arteritis is not a consideration in this 19-year-old patient.\nTakayasu\u2019s Arteritis\nTakayasu\u2019s arteritis is the most common large- vessel vasculitis affecting the aorta among pa- tients younger than 50 years of age, and it typi- cally occurs in women younger than 40 years of age. Takayasu\u2019s arteritis is characterized by a transmural granulomatous infiltrate.4 The as- cending aorta and vessels of the aortic arch are classically affected, but five categories of aortic involvement have been established on the basis of angiographic distribution.11 Long segments of contiguous involvement as well as multiple areas of stenosis or frank vessel occlusion, as seen in this patient, are typical findings associated with Takayasu\u2019s arteritis; vessel damage with aneu- rysm formation can also occur. Patients often present with symptoms related to distal hypo- perfusion of the affected vessels, including arm claudication, syncope, stroke, or diminished or absent pulses on physical examination.12,13 How- ever, aortic-root aneurysm with secondary aortic regurgitation is also a classic complication of Takayasu\u2019s arteritis.14 Takayasu\u2019s arteritis is a possible explanation for this patient\u2019s presenta- tion, but there are several other diagnoses to consider.\n\nSystemic Autoimmune Disease\nIgG4-related disease is a multiorgan disease that is characterized by the insidious accumulation of immune cells in organs, which generally mani- fests as diffuse organ enlargement. Typical or- gan involvement includes the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, pancreas, bile ducts, retroperito- neal tissues, kidneys, and aorta.15 IgG4-related disease most often develops in the sixth decade of life and has male predominance, which makes this diagnosis unlikely in this young fe- male patient.16,17 However, IgG4-related disease has been reported across various age groups, including pediatric patients.18 Large-vessel vas- culitis is a well-established manifestation of IgG4-related disease, and affected patients may have either thoracic or abdominal aortitis with or without aneurysm formation.19 The patient had a combination of thoracic and abdominal aortic involvement as well as multifocal large- vessel stenoses, findings that would be uncom- mon in a patient with IgG4-related disease. Moreover, the patient\u2019s fulminant presentation, subacute evolution of disease, and demographic characteristics make IgG4-related disease an un- likely diagnosis.\nOther systemic autoimmune diseases can\ncause aortitis, including systemic lupus erythe- matosus, rheumatoid vasculitis, sarcoidosis, Cogan\u2019s syndrome, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and relapsing polychondritis. However, these diseases are considered to be secondary causes of large-vessel vasculitis and generally require the presence of associated disease features that were not observed in this patient.\n\nSummary\nTakayasu\u2019s arteritis is the most likely explana- tion for this patient\u2019s subacute, multiorgan dis- ease presentation with inflammatory features. I suspect that she had aortitis complicated by aortic-root dilatation that led to aortic regurgita- tion and heart failure.\n",

In the context of clinical instability due to severe aortic regurgitation, cardiac surgery for aortic-valve replacement was performed on hos- pital day 3. The native aortic-valve cusps were thickened and retracted, and the aorta was only mildly dilated. A 23-mm pericardial valve was used for aortic-valve replacement; this valve was chosen over a mechanical prosthetic valve because the latter would require the use of war- farin anticoagulation, which would complicate the patient\u2019s plans to have children within the next 10 years. Transcatheter aortic-valve replace- ment was considered to be a poor option given that the available devices are not designed or approved for use in the treatment of pure aortic regurgitation and can potentially dislodge.\n\nFigure 3.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining of a biopsy specimen of the aorta (Panel B) does not show evi\u2011 dence of inflammation.\n\nDr. Rex N. Smith: A surgical specimen of the aortic valve and a biopsy specimen of the aorta (Fig. 3) were submitted for pathological evaluation. Nei- ther specimen had pathological features that were characteristic of an inflammatory or infec- tious process. The aortic-valve specimen showed myxomatous degeneration. The biopsy specimen obtained from the aorta was considered to be normal, but aortitis could not be ruled out be- cause of the small amount of tissue that had been obtained.\n",
