    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Olivia C. Smibert: A 48-year-old man with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital because of abdominal pain.\nThe patient had been generally well until 12 years before this presentation, when lymphadenopathy in the axillary and inguinal regions developed and a diag- nosis of stage III follicular lymphoma was made. Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone were administered and induced a clinical response; rituximab maintenance therapy was initiated.\nSeven years before this presentation, recurrent disease developed; rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone were administered. The patient again had a clinical remission, and rituximab maintenance therapy was resumed. Two years before the current presentation, the patient transferred his onco- logic care to this hospital. Swelling was noted in the right inguinal region, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed extensive FDG uptake throughout the body. Biopsy of a paraaortic lymph node revealed high-grade follicular lymphoma. Salvage chemotherapy with cisplatin, gemcitabine, rituximab, and dexamethasone was\nadministered, and the patient had an early clinical remission.\nFour months later, and 20 months before the current presentation, the patient underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation after the administration of car- mustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan. After transplantation, his clinical course was complicated by acute deep-vein thrombosis of the left leg; treatment with therapeutic enoxaparin sodium was initiated but was discontinued after 1 week owing to severe thrombocytopenia.\nFive months later, clinical signs of lymphoma relapse were observed, and biopsy of an enlarged axillary lymph node revealed transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The patient was subsequently treated with several therapies, including blinatumomab, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and pembrolizumab,none of which induced a sustained clinical re- sponse. Because of the lack of clinical response, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was con- sidered.\nTwo and a half weeks before this presenta- tion, the patient was admitted to this hospital for severe pain in the epigastrium and bilateral inguinal regions. Laboratory studies revealed a lactate dehydrogenase level of 1560 U per liter (reference range, 110 to 210), an alanine amino- transferase level of 127 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 55), an aspartate aminotransferase level of 143 U per liter (reference range, 10 to 40), an alkaline phosphatase level of 1506 U per liter (reference range, 30 to 100), and a total bilirubin level of 2.5 mg per deciliter (reference range, 0.0 to 1.0). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, revealed several clustered small pulmonary nodules, progressive hepatosplenomegaly with normal-appearing bile ducts, multifocal enlarging lymph nodes, and new small-volume ascites. Oral methadone and morphine sulfate and a 5-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone were administered, resulting in alleviation of pain and improvement in liver function. The patient was discharged home on the fifth hospital day. Two weeks after discharge, the patient was evaluated in the oncology clinic of this hospital for recurrent severe, sharp pain in the bilateral inguinal regions, as well as diffuse abdominal pain in the upper quadrants that was no longer responsive to oral analgesic agents. He also re- ported night sweats, decreased energy, poor ap- petite, nausea, and constipation. He did not have fevers, chills, headache, vision changes, shortness of breath, cough, or dysuria. Medications were acyclovir, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, ny- statin oral elixir, methadone, morphine sulfate, citalopram, omeprazole, simethicone, and a multivitamin, as well as lorazepam and laxa- tives as needed. He had no known allergies to medications.\nThe patient was born and raised in central Mexico and often returned to visit family. He had moved to the United States 2 years before this presentation. He lived with his wife and two adolescent daughters in an urban neighborhood in New England. He worked in the information technology industry. He had previously smoked one cigarette daily and had quit 4 years earlier; he drank one beer every other week and did not use illicit drugs. His mother had had breast can- cer, and his father had had coronary artery dis- ease, hypertension, and alcohol use disorder. His children were healthy.\nOn examination in the oncology clinic, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the pulse 138 beats per minute, the blood pressure 123/84 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 61.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) 20.0. He had cachexia and was in moder- ate distress from pain. The mucous membranes were dry, and thrush was present in the oro- pharynx. The abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds; the right and left upper quadrants were moderately tender on palpation. Painful lymphadenopathy involving the cervical, supra- clavicular, and inguinal chains was present. The patient was oriented to person, place, and time, and no confusion was noted. There was no rash. Blood levels of electrolytes and results of renal function tests and urinalysis were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the oncology unit of this hospital.\nOn arrival at the oncology unit, the patient was observed to be in severe pain. Intravenous morphine and normal saline were administered. A platelet transfusion was begun. Thirty minutes later, shaking chills and diaphoresis developed. On examination, the temperature was 39.1\u00b0C, and the oxygen saturation was 85% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was som- nolent and oriented to self but not to location or time, and he had slow, nonsensical speech. Blood cultures were obtained. Oxygen, intrave- nous cefepime and meperidine, and oral metro- nidazole and acetaminophen were administered; the administration of fentanyl with a patient- controlled analgesia pump was begun for pain control. By the following morning, the patient\u2019s mental status had returned to baseline.\nOn the second hospital day, abdominal pain and low-grade fever persisted. Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Filgrastim was ad- ministered. Ultrasonography of the abdomen re- vealed heterogeneous liver parenchyma, diffuse thickening of the gallbladder wall, and no dilatation of the bile ducts.\nDr. Avinash Kambadakone: CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1A, 1B, and 1C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial, revealed multiple new, poorly circumscribed hypodense lesions throughout the liver and new bilateral pleural effusions. There was gradual re- duction in the multifocal abdominopelvic lymph- adenopathy and stable splenomegaly with hypo- dense splenic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver was recommended for further characterization of the lesions.\nDr. Smibert: On the third hospital day, ab- dominal pain and low-grade fevers persisted and intermittent episodes of somnolence and confu- sion, including inability to respond to questions, recurred. Laboratory studies revealed an ammo- nia level of 59 \u03bcmol per liter (reference range, 12 to 48), a lipase level of 260 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60), and an amylase level of 187 U per liter (reference range, 3 to 100); other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Kambadakone: MRI of the liver (Fig. 1D, 1E, and 1F) with cholangiopancreatography, per- formed after the administration of intravenous gadolinium, confirmed the presence of multiple ill-defined foci throughout the liver, with hyper- intensity on T2-weighted imaging and no appre- ciable enhancement, and also showed focal lesions of a similar appearance throughout the spleen. There was no dilatation of the bile ducts. The imaging findings suggested the diagnostic pos- sibility of hepatosplenic microabscesses or new lymphomatous deposits.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Michael K. Mansour: This 48-year-old man, who had a 12-year history of relapsing follicular lymphoma that had been treated with multiple rounds of intensive chemotherapy, autologous stem-cell transplantation, and various immune- based therapies, presented with aggressive recurrent disease. In this context, I will construct a differential diagnosis to account for his current clinical presentation, which is characterized by fever, pain in the upper quadrants, liver-function abnormalities, and imaging findings indicative of hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pneumonia.\nWe know that this patient has rapidly pro- gressive cancer, and some of the presenting symptoms are probably associated with his un- derlying disease. However, lymphoma alone does not necessarily explain his entire clinical story. Therefore, we should explore other diag- noses, including conditions that can result from the various therapies he had received to treat his lymphoma and potential infectious complica- tions that can occur in the context of profound immune enhancement.\n\nImmunotherapy and Immunologic Overstimulation\nCould this patient\u2019s clinical presentation be due to the use of immune-based therapies? He had received several immunotherapies, including blinatumomab (a bispecific T-cell engager), CAR T cells, and pembrolizumab (a programmed death 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor). Although these therapies have different mechanisms of action, they are all designed to augment an anticancer immune response. Most of the side effects as- sociated with immunotherapies are related to immunologic overstimulation and subsequent bystander tissue damage due to production of massive levels of cytokine, which is often accom- panied by features of autoimmunity that com- monly involve the lungs, skin, and gastrointesti- nal tract, although many tissue types have been affected. Although this patient has features con- sistent with immunotoxicity, the onset of his acute illness occurred far too long after treat- ment with immune-based therapy, given that immune-mediated side effects typically develop weeks after the administration of these medica- tions.\nRituximab, Lymphoma, and Immunosuppression This patient had also received rituximab, an anti- body that targets the CD20 molecule, thereby causing B-cell depletion. The immunosuppres- sive effects of rituximab can be quite prolonged, and in some case series, rituximab-related infec- tious complications occurred up to 3 years after\n \ninfusion, which may reflect the prolonged dura- tion of B-cell depletion and the critical nature of these immune cells in controlling infectious diseases. Several infections have been associated with rituximab, including those caused by virus- es, fungi, and mycobacteria.1 Similarly, lymphoma results in dysregulated immunity and is associ- ated with infectious complications.2 Given this patient\u2019s high risk of infection related to pro- longed rituximab use, glucocorticoid adminis- tration, and lymphoma itself, I will next consider various infectious diseases that may explain his clinical presentation.\n\nBacterial Infections\nVarious bacterial infections can result in ab- dominal pain and pneumonia. Infections with legionella species classically cause pneumonia and gastrointestinal manifestations but do not typically cause nodular lesions in the liver. No information has been provided about animal exposures, which would raise concern about zoonotic infections, such as brucella or coxiella infection; both can cause pulmonary infiltrates and liver lesions. Zoonosis due to bartonella, the agent of cat scratch disease, can cause liver le- sions similar to those seen in this patient, but pneumonia would be a rare manifestation.\n\nTuberculosis\nThis patient was raised in Mexico, where the reported rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infec- tion is 20 to 49 per 100,000 patients.3 For this reason, pulmonary M. tuberculosis reactivation with extrapulmonary dissemination should be considered in this case.4 However, tuberculosis was not discussed in the case presentation, and this patient would almost certainly have been tested and possibly treated for latent M. tubercu- losis infection before receiving ablative chemo- therapy. I will assume that such testing was negative and therefore that the diagnosis of tu- berculosis is unlikely.\n\nViral Infections\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are both prevalent among patients with lymphoma. In addition, there is a clinically significant risk of reactivation of these viruses with the use of bone marrow\u2013ablative regimens. Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus are associated with hepatic involvement and generalized lymphadenopathy. However, this patient has hepatic nodules and pulmonary opacities and does not have atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, and these features make these viral syndromes unlikely.\n\nToxoplasmosis\nThis patient is profoundly immunocompromised and has traveled to visit friends and family in Mexico, where toxoplasma species are endemic. Acute disease, generalized lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary lesions can be consistent with acute toxoplasmosis, but nodular lesions in the liver are not consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nFungal Infections\nThe patient\u2019s history of lymphoma and treat- ment with rituximab and glucocorticoids puts him at high risk for disseminated fungal infec- tion. Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy are suggestive of several fungal pathogens, includ- ing histoplasma, candida, and cryptococcus spe- cies. Travel to Mexico and residency in New England put him at moderate risk for histoplas- mosis. Histoplasma is a dimorphic fungus that grows as a mold in the environment yet germi- nates as a yeast after inhalation of the spores or conidia. Pulmonary lesions and generalized lymphadenopathy are classic features of histo- plasmosis, but ill-defined micronodular liver le- sions would be atypical of this diagnosis.\nCandida species can be commensal organ-isms found in the skin, oropharynx, or vagina or as part of the normal flora of the gastrointesti- nal tract. Patients who have indwelling catheters or are receiving chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt the intestinal mucosa often have chronic translocation of candida from the bowel into the bloodstream.5 In a small number of patients, even transient candidemia can result in formation of small fungal abscesses in multiple organs, most commonly in the liver and spleen, causing hepatosplenic candidiasis. Of note, patients may be asymptomatic when candidemia first devel- ops and then become clinically ill during recon- stitution of neutrophils after a period of severe neutropenia.6 The restoration of innate immu- nity against candida is associated with high fe- ver, pain in the right upper quadrant, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level suggestive of biliary tract involvement. However, this patient presented with an absolute neutrophil count of 3010 per microliter and did not have a history of recent neutropenia. In addition, candida in- fections rarely cause pneumonia. The absence of recent neutropenia and the presence of pulmo- nary opacities make the diagnosis of hepato- splenic candidiasis unlikely.\nCryptococcus is a ubiquitous yeast that, when inhaled, often causes pneumonia and can then disseminate to most organs, including the cen- tral nervous system (CNS), skin, bone, and pros- tate. Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common species isolated, accounting for more than 80% of cryptococcal infections. C. neoformans infec- tion mainly occurs in severely immunocompro- mised patients, such as those infected with hu- man immunodeficiency virus.7 In this patient, ablative chemotherapy use, glucocorticoid use, and rituximab use8 are risk factors for dissemi- nated cryptococcosis. The features of his presen- tation are consistent with a diagnosis of crypto- coccal disease, which is characterized by acute pneumonia and likely dissemination to abdomi- nal organs. Hepatic involvement is not common in patients with disseminated C. neoformans infec- tion, but it has been reported.9,10 Even immuno- competent patients have presented with invasive fungal infections, possibly owing to the develop- ment of autoantibodies or mutations in intracel- lular signaling proteins that are responsible for the anticryptococcal immune response.11,12\nIn this profoundly immunosuppressed patient with a history of refractory B-cell lymphoma and extensive treatment with myeloablative chemo- therapy and with a clinical presentation of fever, pneumonia, and hepatic disease, disseminated cryptococcal disease is the most likely diagno- sis. To establish this diagnosis, I would perform a test for soluble cryptococcal antigen, which has high sensitivity, especially given the long half- life of cryptococcal antigen. Cryptococcus grows efficiently in automated blood-culture systems, so the diagnosis could potentially be established by obtaining routine blood cultures. If these tests are unrevealing, the diagnosis could poten- tially be made by performing a liver biopsy, since the organism could be grown in culture and also observed on histologic examination of the biopsy specimen.\n",
    "Clinical Diagnosis": "Disseminated cryptococcal infection.",
    "Diagnosis": "Disseminated cryptococcosis.",
    "Key testing": "Serial blood cultures",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Maroun M. Sfeir: Serial blood cultures were obtained from the patient, and cultures in aero- bic bottles obtained on hospital days 4, 6, and 8 were positive for microbial growth within 72 hours of incubation. Gram\u2019s staining of the blood-culture broth showed yeast (Fig. 2A). The blood-culture broth was subcultured with the use of routine bacterial and fungal culture media, including Sabouraud dextrose agar (SAB), which revealed growth on day 3 of incubation (Fig. 2B). On matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013 time-of-flight mass spectrometry, a colony grow- ing on the SAB plate was identified as C. neo- formans.\nOnce the culture grew cryptococcus, a serum\ncryptococcal antigen test was performed and was positive at 1:1024 dilution. This latex agglu- tination test uses latex particles that are coated with antibodies directed against an antigen that is present on the polysaccharide capsule of\nC. neoformans. Serum cryptococcal antigen test- ing has a sensitivity of 93 to 100%.13 The crypto- coccal antigen titers correlate with organism burden and prognosis.\nOne day after the first positive blood culture grew cryptococcus, a lumbar puncture was per- formed. Fungal wet preparation of the cerebro- spinal fluid (CSF) was negative. However, fungal culture of the CSF grew C. neoformans on day 3 of incubation. Of note, cryptococcal antigen was not detected in the CSF. On repeat CSF crypto- coccal antigen testing by means of a latex ag- glutination test and also by means of a lateral flow assay with serial dilutions of the specimen, cryptococcal antigen was still not detected. In addition, the CSF was sent to a reference labora- tory for cryptococcal antigen testing, which was reported as negative. A laboratory investigation was performed to determine the cause of the false negative CSF cryptococcal antigen testing, but no explanation was found.\n",
