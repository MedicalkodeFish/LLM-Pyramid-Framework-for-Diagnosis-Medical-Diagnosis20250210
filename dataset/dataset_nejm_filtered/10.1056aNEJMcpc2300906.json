    "Primary Symptom": "A 21-Year-Old Man with Progressive Dyspnea",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Alison S. Witkin: A 21-year-old male college student was evaluated in the cardiol- ogy clinic at this hospital, before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, because of progressive dyspnea.\nWhen the patient was in his early teens, he was evaluated for intermittent ex- ertional dyspnea and received a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma. Montelukast and an albuterol inhaler were prescribed for use as needed; however, he had not used these medications in the 2 years before the current presentation.\nSeveral months before the current presentation, the patient noticed increased dyspnea, which occurred when he was playing sports such as volleyball or walking on campus, specifically when walking at an incline or while carrying parcels. Friends had commented on his inability to \u201ckeep up\u201d during games and while walking.\nSix days before the current presentation, the patient was evaluated for dyspnea by his primary care physician at a hospital affiliated with this hospital. The heart rate was 71 beats per minute and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical examination was reportedly normal. An electrocardio- gram (ECG), transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and chest radiograph were ob- tained.\nDr. David M. Dudzinski: An ECG (Fig. 1A) showed right bundle-branch block and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A TTE (Fig. 1B and 1C) showed right ventricular enlargement with severe hypokinesia and hypertrophy (estimated right ventricular systolic pressure, 84 mm Hg), right atrial enlargement, flattening of the interventricular septum during systole and diastole, moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation, and inferior vena cava dilatation.\nDr. Anuradha S. Shenoy-Bhangle: A frontal chest radiograph (Fig. 2A) showed en- larged hila and an irregular calcification over the right upper quadrant.\nDr. Witkin: The patient was referred to the emergency department of the other hospital. On examination, the heart rate was 77 beats per minute, the blood pressure 130/82  mm  Hg,  the  respiratory  rate  20  breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 93% while he was breathing ambient air. The physical exami- nation was reportedly normal. The white-cell dif- ferential count and blood levels of calcium, amylase, lipase, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Echocardiography performed after the administration of agitated saline (a \u201cbubble study\u201d) did not reveal an atrial septal defect, but a patent foramen ovale with right-to- left shunting was identified.\nDr. Shenoy-Bhangle: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Fig. 2B and 2C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial and in accordance with a pulmonary embo- lism protocol, ruled out pulmonary embolism. However, the main pulmonary artery was dilated (diameter, 39 mm; normal value, 29 in men and 27 in women), as were segmental pulmonary ar- tery branches. The right ventricle was enlarged. Bilateral mild, diffuse, centrilobular ground-glass nodules were noted, along with interlobular sep- tal thickening. A 45-mm area of coarse calcifica- tion was seen in the right lobe of the liver.\nDr. Witkin: The patient was discharged from\nthe emergency department of the other hospital with a plan for follow-up the next morning in the cardiology clinic at this hospital. At the fol- low-up visit, the system review was notable for snoring (reported by his roommates) and dyspnea that occurred after he ascended three flights of stairs. He had no chest pain or pressure, edema, orthopnea, dyspnea at night, light-headedness, syncope, fever, recent illness, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, change in weight, jaundice, abdomi- nal pain or distention, change in bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, hair or nail changes, or rash.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for internal hemorrhoids with an episode of rectal bleeding, as well as a traumatic ankle sprain 3 years before the current presentation. He took no medi- cations but had previously taken methylphenidate and atomoxetine for a learning disability charac- terized by inattention and difficulty with auditory processing. He took several supplements for calm- ing and increased attention, which included the following ingredients: rhodiola extract, phospha- tidylserine, melatonin, astaxanthin, and amino acids such as glutamate, glycine, 5-hydroxytrypto- phan, taurine, theanine, and tyrosine. He consumed protein shakes before workouts and had used creatine supplements 2 years earlier. He had received an influenza vaccine and all the routine immunizations that are required to attend school. The patient was a student at a local college.\nDuring the current school year, he had been ex- ercising at the gym three times per week, doing mostly isometric exercise and some aerobic exer- cise. He had never used cigarettes, electronic ciga- rettes, marijuana, or illicit substances. He lived with roommates, and there were no known allergic or environmental exposures in their apartment. His family history was notable for inflammatory bowel disease in his father, coronary artery disease in several paternal relatives, myocardial infarction in his maternal grandfather (when he was in his 70s), colon cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after long-term smoking in his maternal grandmother, and asthma in his mater- nal aunt. His two siblings were healthy. On examination, the heart rate was 81 beats per  minute,  the  blood  pressure 120/72 mm Hg in the right arm and 122/72 mm Hg in the left arm, and the respiratory rate 16 breaths per min- ute. The oxygen saturation was 95% while the patient was in the supine position and breathing ambient air, and the level decreased to 90% after he ascended two flights of stairs. The weight was\n79.8 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 27.6. The patient appeared to have normal development and was breathing comfortably. The sclerae were anicteric. The jugular venous pres- sure was 14 cm of water. A parasternal heave was detected. On auscultation, the lungs were clear, the P2 heart sound was accentuated, and a grade\n3/6 early systolic murmur was present at the left\nsternal border. There was no hepatosplenomega- ly. Clubbing of the fingers and toes was present, without cyanosis.\nAn ECG showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute, right bundle-branch block, and evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Blood levels of thyrotropin and glycated hemoglobin were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nAdditional tests were performed the next day. Spirometry showed normal lung volumes and a reduced diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO; 71% of the predicted value). A bronchodilator test showed no clinically signifi- cant response to an inhaled bronchodilator. Right heart catheterization revealed a right atrial pres- sure of 6 mm Hg, a right ventricular pressure of 90/7  mm  Hg,  a  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  of 89/28 mm Hg (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 57 mm Hg), and a pulmonary arterial wedge pres- sure of 8 mm Hg. The central venous oxygen satu- ration was 67% (reference range, 60 to 70), the mixed venous oxygen saturation 71% (reference range, 65 to 75), and the arterial oxygen satura- tion 91% while the patient was breathing ambi- ent air. The cardiac output, measured by means of thermodilution, was 6.2 liters per minute. The pulmonary vascular resistance was approximate- ly 8 Wood units. After the patient inhaled 30 ppm of nitric oxide, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 52 mm Hg and the cardiac output 6.0 liters per minute.\n\nTable 1.

Cardiac Studies.\nAn electrocardiogram (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, and right ventricular hypertrophy, as evidenced by right axis deviation and an increased R\u2032-wave amplitude in lead V1. Echocardiographic images ob- tained in a parasternal short-axis view (Panel B) and in an apical four-chamber view with color Doppler (Panel C) both show enlargement of the right ventricle (RV); LV denotes left ventricle. There is also flattening of the interven- tricular septum during systole, a finding that suggests elevated pressures in the right side of the heart (Panel B).\nThere is moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation (Panel C, asterisk); on the basis of the tricuspid regurgitation velocity, the estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 84 mm Hg. Echocardiographic images obtained in other views (not shown) confirmed the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy.\n\nFigure 2. Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nA frontal chest radiograph (Panel A) shows enlarged hila (arrows). A focal area of coarse calcification is seen over the right upper quadrant (arrowhead). Axial contrast-enhanced CT images of the chest (Panels B and C) show enlargement of the right ventricle (Panel B, arrow) and dilatation of the main pulmonary artery and its right (R) and left (L) main branches (Panel C, arrowheads). The calcified mass is partially seen with- in the hepatic dome (Panel B, arrowhead).\n\nFigure 3. Imaging Studies of the Abdomen.  Abdominal ultrasound images without and with color Doppler (Panel A) show an echogenic calcified mass in the right hepatic lobe (arrow); the main portal vein\nis absent. Coronal contrast-enhanced images from MRI of the abdomen (Panels B and C) show that the main portal vein is absent (Panel B, oval) and a large venous shunt connects the superior mesenteric vein to the right iliac vein (Panel B, arrow). There are multiple liver le- sions with uptake of a hepatobiliary agent that are sug- gestive of focal nodular hyperplasia (Panel C, arrows).\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Bradley A. Maron: This patient has pulmonary hypertension, a distinct clinical diagnosis that is established on the basis of a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of more than 20 mm Hg mea- sured on right heart catheterization.1,2 The clini- cal presentation, pathophysiological features, and disease course of pulmonary hypertension can vary.3 Patients with pulmonary hypertension typi- cally have some combination of progressive dyspnea, exercise limitation, and clinical signs or examination findings that are indicative of pulmonary vascular and right ventricular dys- function, such as hypoxemia, an accentuated P2\nheart sound, or lower-leg edema. In many patients,\nparticularly young and otherwise healthy patients, the initial symptoms may be nonspecific and mild. Indeed, the symptoms are often attributed mis- takenly to other cardiopulmonary diseases that are encountered more commonly in general med- ical practice, such as asthma.4 This problem re- sults in an average delay to diagnosis of several years.5 Such a delay may have occurred in this case, given the long-standing, albeit incompletely characterized, pattern of exertional dyspnea.\n\nHemodynamic Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension\nThe approach to management of pulmonary hy- pertension involves two specific but integrated steps: hemodynamic classification and clinical classification.1 An elevated mean pulmonary ar- terial pressure may be caused by increased pul- monary blood flow in the context of an immedi- ately reversible condition, such as anemia or infection. These conditions, however, would not be expected to cause an increase in the pulmo- nary vascular resistance. For this reason, a pul- monary vascular resistance of more than 2 Wood units is used to identify precapillary pulmonary hypertension.6-8 A pulmonary arterial wedge pres- sure of more than 15 mm Hg is used to identify postcapillary pulmonary hypertension.9 The pul- monary arterial wedge pressure reflects the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure when measured in the absence of a stenotic lesion of the mitral valve or pulmonary veins.\nThis patient meets the following criteria for isolated precapillary pulmonary hypertension: a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of more than 20 mm Hg, a pulmonary vascular resistance of more than 2 Wood units, and a pulmonary arte- rial wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or less. His mean pulmonary arterial pressure (57 mm Hg) and pul- monary vascular resistance (approximately 8 Wood units) are indicative of severe disease. Such levels have been associated with a substantial increase in mortality,2,7 which emphasizes the need for an accurate and timely diagnosis.\n\nClinical Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension\nPrecapillary pulmonary hypertension is most of- ten clinically classified as one of three groups (out of five total groups) established at the World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension: pulmo- nary arterial hypertension (group 1), pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease or driven by hypoxia (group 3), or pulmonary hyper- tension associated chronic thromboembolic pul- monary artery obstruction (group 4).8 It is pos- sible for precapillary pulmonary hypertension to be classified as pulmonary hypertension due to unclear or multifactorial mechanisms (group 5). Postcapillary pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (group 2) is common but was not observed in this patient. At this stage in the diagnostic process, a differential diagnosis can be constructed with consideration of the he- modynamic classification of pulmonary hyper- tension, as well as the patient\u2019s clinical features and history.\n\nGroup 3 Pulmonary Hypertension\nOn spirometry, the lung volumes were normal. This finding suggests that a primary obstructive or restrictive ventilatory defect is unlikely. The DLCO was mildly decreased, but this finding could be a result of, rather than a cause of, pulmonary vascular disease. Chest radiography ruled out me- chanical obstruction of the pulmonary arteries by a tumor or another anatomical abnormality of the lung. Therefore, a diagnosis of group 3 pul- monary hypertension seems highly unlikely.\n \nGroup 4 Pulmonary Hypertension\nOccult hypercoagulable disorders that cause sub- acute pulmonary embolism in childhood or ado- lescence, with longitudinal pulmonary vascular remodeling, have been reported to result in group 4 pulmonary hypertension in patients with inflam- matory disease or thrombophilias.10 Congenital stenosis of a pulmonary artery or vein that is de- tected initially in adulthood also warrants consid- eration.11 Nonetheless, this patient had no specific clinical or imaging features that would suggest a thrombotic or vascular stenotic condition that con- fers a predisposition to pulmonary hypertension.\n\nGroup 1 Pulmonary Hypertension\nGroup 1 encompasses pulmonary arterial hyper- tension, which may be of an unknown cause, hereditary, or associated with drugs or toxins, a connective-tissue disease, certain infections (human immunodeficiency virus infection or schistosomiasis), portal hypertension (known as \u201cportopulmonary hypertension\u201d when associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension), or con- genital heart disease, including an extracardiac (systemic to pulmonary artery) shunt.1,8 This patient\u2019s symptom trajectory and young age sug- gest that he has a long-standing disease process, perhaps a condition that is congenital or was acquired many years before the current presenta- tion. However, he has no clear family history of pulmonary vascular disease that would be sug- gestive of hereditary pulmonary arterial hyper- tension, which is most often due to a variant in BMPR2 (the gene that encodes bone morphoge- netic protein receptor type 2).12\nAlthough the patient has taken supplements\nthat contained 5-hydroxytryptophan, which may theoretically increase the risk of pulmonary arte- rial hypertension through its effects on serotonin bioavailability, the use of these supplements is an unlikely cause of his symptoms.13 Other medi- cations \u2014 including anorexigens (fenfluramine and phentermine),14 chemotherapeutics (dasat- inib and selected other tyrosine kinase inhibi- tors),15 and stimulants (methamphetamine)16 \u2014 have been strongly associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension, but he has no history of taking these medications. Therefore, drug- or toxin-associated  pulmonary  arterial hypertension is unlikely. Furthermore, the findings on physical examination and laboratory testing are not consistent with a diagnosis of a connective- tissue disease.\nReview of this patient\u2019s TTE shows severe right ventricular enlargement with hypertrophy and impaired systolic function, as well as right atrial enlargement, interventricular septal flat tening during systole and diastole, and inferior vena cava dilatation. Detailed analysis of the data obtained on right heart catheterization also re- veals potentially important diagnostic clues. The cardiac output is 6.2 liters per minute; this find- ing contrasts with the low cardiac output that is typically seen in patients with advanced idio- pathic pulmonary arterial hypertension17 and, in combination with the presence of resting hypox- emia (arterial oxygen saturation, 91%), suggests the possibility of a shunt. However, measure- ment of the pulmonary venous oxygen saturation\n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension, most likely due to congenital heart disease and possibly due to a vascular abnormality.\n\n \nPulmonary arterial hypertension due to an extra- cardiac vascular shunt.\n\nImaging Studies\n \nwould be needed to definitively diagnose  and     \t\n \nquantify a shunt, and these data were not obtained in this patient.\nOverall, this patient\u2019s constellation of find- ings suggests that chronic hyperdynamic circu- lation has resulted in pulmonary hypertension and has subsequently led to pathogenic remod- eling of the right side of the heart. Such pulmo- nary hypertension may be caused by intracardiac shunting from a sinus venosus atrial septal defect or another cardiac structural anomaly, which can be challenging to identify by means of TTE alone.18 Alternatively, pulmonary hypertension due to an anomalous arteriovenous malformation that af- fects the pulmonary veins, systemic veins, or portal venous system has also been reported. In this patient, imaging revealed liver calcification and inferior vena cava dilatation; these findings are nonspecific but nonetheless suggest that a hepatic or portal circulatory abnormality could be the cause of his pulmonary hypertension.\n\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen (Fig. 3B and 3C), performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed that the hepatic artery was dilated, the main portal vein was absent, and a large venous shunt connected the superior mesenteric vein to the right iliac vein. The superior mesenteric vein and the splen- ic vein formed a common channel that drained into the inferior vena cava. The liver contained multiple focal nodular hyperplasia\u2013like lesions, including a calcified mass in the right lobe with- out any features suggestive of cancer.",
