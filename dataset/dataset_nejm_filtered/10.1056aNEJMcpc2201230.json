    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. David M. Dudzinski: A 78-year-old man was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital because of biventricular myocardial wall thickening, progressive mi- tral regurgitation, and ventricular arrhythmias.\nThe patient had been a distinguished multisport athlete in high school and col- lege. However, in his 20s, he found that he was unable to perform competitively, and he noticed that he did not sweat as much as his teammates. After an episode of sports-related exertional dizziness, he was evaluated by a physician, and a diag- nosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was considered.\nTwenty-five years before the current evaluation, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 19 mm (reference value, \u226411), a left ventricular ejection fraction of 74% (reference range, 50 to 75), mitral valve thickening, and trace mitral regurgitation, with no left ventricular outflow gradient. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, incom- plete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that met the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (Fig. 1A). The patient\u2019s blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, and he started treatment with meto- prolol succinate and then also with amlodipine for elevated blood pressure.\nDuring the next 10 years, the patient had intermittent chest discomfort, exer- tional dyspnea, and leg edema. The chest discomfort and exertional dyspnea were most likely to occur when he was walking or after he had eaten a meal. He was evaluated by three cardiologists; treatment with metoprolol succinate and amlo- dipine was continued, treatment with enalapril was started, and triamterene\u2013 hydrochlorothiazide was administered as needed for leg edema.\nA repeat TTE reportedly showed a symmetric left ventricular wall thickness of 20 mm, a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, right ventricular wall thicken- ing, left atrial enlargement, mitral valve thickening, mild-to-moderate mitral re- gurgitation, aortic valve thickening, and mild ascending aortic dilatation (39 mm), with no evidence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. An exercise stress test followed by imaging performed with the use of sestamibi (known as a sestamibi stress test) revealed left ventricular wall thickening, with no perfusion defects. Coronary angiography revealed evidence of chronic total occlusion of the distal left ante- rior descending artery, with collateral flow from both the left and right coronary arteries. Left ventriculography revealed hyperdynamic left ven- tricular function and 2+ mitral regurgitation (see Video 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 28 mm Hg (reference range, 5 to 10), with no left ventricular intracavitary gradient, including during ventricular ectopic beats and during the Valsalva maneuver, and with no evi- dence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruc- tion. The blood pressure remained well con- trolled while the patient was taking metoprolol, amlodipine, and enalapril.\nNine years before the current evaluation, the patient had complete heart block with symptom- atic bradycardia (Fig. 1B), with associated nausea, dizziness, and chest discomfort. A temporary transvenous pacing wire was placed; the results of coronary angiography performed at that time were unchanged from the previous study. The creatinine level was 1.2 mg per deciliter (106 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to 1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]); the blood levels of electrolytes and thyrotropin were nor- mal, as were the results of serum protein elec- trophoresis. A dual-chamber implantable cardio- verter\u2013defibrillator (ICD) was placed. Four months later, atrial fibrillation developed. Cardioversion was performed with guidance by transesopha- geal echocardiography, resulting in sinus rhythm. However, atrial fibrillation recurred after 3 days. Treatment with amiodarone and warfarin was begun.\nDuring the next 5 years, recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detect- ed on ICD interrogation. A repeat TTE showed a left ventricular wall thickness of 23 mm and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation.\nFour years before the current evaluation, dur- ing a holiday trip, the patient was hospitalized in another state because of pulmonary edema that developed after he had consumed food that was high in sodium. He was treated with intra- venous furosemide and discharged with a pre- scription for oral furosemide. Findings on TTE were reportedly similar to those observed previ- ously. Treatment with amlodipine was stopped because of lightheadedness.\nAt follow-up appointments during the next 4 years, the patient reported fatigue and exer- tional dyspnea that occurred after he had climbed one flight of stairs or when he was walking on an incline. In addition, he had nocturia once per night, slept on two pillows, and had intermittent wheezing, including episodes that awakened him from sleep. Treatment with oral furosemide (administered twice daily) was continued. Recur- rent nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were detected on ICD interrogation. Approxi- mately 3.5 years before the current evaluation, the patient sustained a fall that was unrelated to his cardiac condition. At that time, computed tomography of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, did not reveal any evidence of hemorrhage or stroke but showed periventricular and deep white- matter hypodensities. Results of pulmonary- function testing were normal.\nThe patient presented for the current evalua-\ntion at the request of his two teenage grandsons, who wanted to know about any familial cardiac risk factors that could influence their participa- tion in sports. A review of systems was notable for intermittent palpitations, chronic dry eyes, reduced hearing, tinnitus in both ears (greater in the right ear than in the left ear), restless legs, and constipation. The patient reported no head- ache, paresthesia, stroke symptoms, diarrhea, skin changes, or intolerance to heat or cold. His medical history included cardiomyopathy, coro- nary artery disease, atrioventricular block and atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, cataracts, and prostatic hypertrophy with carcinoma in situ. Medications included furosemide, warfarin, amio- darone, aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, enala- pril, and tamsulosin, as well as inhaled flutica- sone. Amiodarone had caused thyroiditis, which had been treated with a course of prednisone; there were no other known adverse reactions to medication.\nThe patient was a retired executive and lived with his spouse in Massachusetts. His family history was notable for brain cancer in his fa- ther, obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in his mother, and lung cancer in his sister, who had died from the disease. There was also a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in his sister and in a niece. His family was of Mediterranean origin; information about other relatives was limited. His son and grandsons were healthy, and his son had reportedly had normal results on an electrocardiogram and echocardiograms. The pa- tient did not drink alcohol and had never used tobacco.\nOn examination, the heart rate was 79 beats per minute and the blood pressure 106/60 mm Hg. The weight was 89 kg and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 26.6. There was a left ventricular heave. Auscultation revealed splitting of the S2 heart sound, a grade 3/6 systolic mur- mur that could be heard throughout the precor- dium and did not change during the Valsalva maneuver, and a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex that radiated to the axilla; there was no S3 heart sound. There was trace leg edema and mild chronic venous stasis. The rest of the examination was normal.\nLaboratory test results were notable for a cre-\natinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter (133 \u03bcmol per liter), a urea nitrogen level of 39 mg per deciliter (13.9 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to 8.9 mmol per liter]), an international normalized ratio of 2.1 (refer- ence range, 0.9 to 1.1), and an N-terminal pro\u2013 B-type natriuretic peptide level of 2523 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800), as well as 1+ protein on urinalysis. The blood levels of iron, glycated hemoglobin, thyrotropin, and free thyrox- ine were normal, and a test for antinuclear anti- bodies was negative. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with ventricular pacing.\nA TTE was obtained.\n\nFigure 1. Electrocardiograms.\nAn electrocardiogram obtained 25 years before the current evaluation (Panel A) shows sinus rhythm, incomplete right bundle-branch block, precordial J-point elevation, and QRS voltage that meets the electrocardiographic criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Electrocardiographic tracings obtained during the next 15 years showed similar find- ings. An electrocardiogram obtained 9 years before the current evaluation (Panel B) shows sinus rhythm with com- plete heart block and escape rhythm with right bundle-branch block and left-axis deviation.\n\nFigure 2 (facing page). Echocardiograms.\nA transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in the parasternal long-axis view (Panel A) shows marked left ventricular wall thickening, aortic and mitral valve thickening, a trace pericardial effusion, and left atrial enlargement; the proxi- mal portion of the aorta is not dilated, and there is no effacement at the sinotubular junction. A TTE in the parasternal short-axis view at the level of the mitral valve (Panel B) shows that the left ventricular wall thickening is symmetric. A continuous-wave Doppler echocardio- gram through the aortic valve (Panel C) shows a peak velocity of 1.5 m per second (reference range at Mayo Clinic laboratory, 0.8 to 1.8), a finding that indicates the absence of clinically significant stenosis. A TTE in the parasternal long-axis view with color Doppler (Panel D) shows no acceleration of flow in the left ventricular out-\nflow tract and no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve; there is moderate mitral regurgita- tion, which is centrally directed, rather than posteriorly directed (as typically seen with hypertrophic cardiomy- opathy). A pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiogram of the mitral inflow (Panel E) shows an elevated peak velocity during early diastole (E-wave velocity, 120 cm per second; reference range, 40 to 88), which is partially due to clin- ically significant mitral regurgitation, as well as a mark- edly abbreviated deceleration time, which is suggestive of a stiff left ventricle and predictive of an increased left ventricular filling pressure. A tissue Doppler echocardio- gram of the lateral mitral annulus (Panel F) shows a se- verely diminished velocity during early diastole (e\u2032 velocity, 5 cm per second; reference value, >9). The markedly in- creased ratio of E-wave velocity to e\u2032 velocity (E:e\u2032 ratio, 24; reference value, <10), in addition to biatrial enlarge- ment and an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 56 mm Hg (not shown), is consistent with restrictive left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Patricia A. Pellikka: This 78-year-old man pre- sented for evaluation of chronic ventricular myo- cardial wall thickening, mitral regurgitation, and recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias. In deter- mining the process underlying his cardiomyopa- thy, it is important to consider the clues from the echocardiograms in the context of the his- tory and findings on physical examination. I re- viewed and interpreted the patient\u2019s most recent echocardiographic images, which were obtained at the time of the current evaluation. The images were remarkable for severe symmetric thicken- ing of the left ventricular myocardial wall, which measured 21 mm in end diastole (Fig. 2A and 2B and Videos 2 and 3). The left ventricular wall\n \nthickness varies according to sex and body-sur- face area but is usually 11 mm or less.1 There was borderline impairment of global systolic function.\n\nLeft Ventricular Wall Thickening\nThe most common cause of left ventricular wall thickening is hypertensive heart disease, which develops in the context of long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension. Patients with hyperten- sion can have concentric hypertrophy, eccentric hypertrophy, or concentric remodeling in the left ventricle. These types of remodeling are differ- entiated according to the left ventricular mass index and relative wall thickness; the presence of concurrent obesity, valvular or ischemic heart disease, and genetic factors can influence the type of remodeling that occurs.2,3 Left ventricu- lar wall thickening that is associated with hyper- tension is reversible. This patient had received treatment for hypertension, and his blood pres- sure was normal at the time of the current evaluation. Also, another feature of hypertensive heart disease, effacement of the sinotubular junction, was not present (Fig. 2A).\nLeft ventricular wall thickening can be a con-\nsequence of athletic training, depending on the type of exercise. Athletes can have increases in the left ventricular diameter, wall thickness, and mass that are associated with normal systolic and diastolic function and with sinus bradycar- dia.4 A left ventricular wall thickness of 13 mm or greater is uncommon in athletes. The wall thickness typically decreases with detraining, although the heart remains enlarged in some athletes. This patient had an extensive history of left ventricular wall thickening, which pro- gressed long after he had stopped participating in sports; this factor suggests that a different underlying process was causing his left ventricu- lar wall thickening.\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy can be caused by\naortic valve stenosis, subvalvular aortic stenosis, supravalvular aortic stenosis, or aortic coarcta- tion, but these abnormalities would have been detected on echocardiography. The patient had thickening of the trileaflet aortic valve, but Dop- pler echocardiography did not reveal clinically significant aortic valve obstruction (Fig. 2C).\nThe conditions that have been considered so far would not explain the concurrent thickening of the right ventricular myocardial wall, which is best visualized in the subcostal view (Video 4). Thus, conditions associated with biventricular wall thickening must be considered in this pa- tient\u2019s differential diagnosis.\n\nBiventricular Wall Thickening\nThe history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the patient\u2019s sister and niece is suggestive of a familial genetic disorder. Conventional hyper- trophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal domi- nant condition that is caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins. It has an estimated preva- lence of 1 in 500 persons, but the prevalence may be higher than estimated because of undi- agnosed disease.5 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most commonly associated with ventricular hypertrophy involving only the left ventricle. However, there is considerable phenotypic hetero- geneity, and right ventricular hypertrophy can occur, which can make it challenging to estab- lish the diagnosis. Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is present or develops over time in 70% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.5 Hypertrophy or displacement of the papil- lary muscles, anomalous insertion of the papillary muscles, and elongation of the mitral valve leaf- lets with systolic anterior motion and posteriorly directed mitral regurgitation are common echo- cardiographic features. Although this patient had papillary muscle hypertrophy, she had mitral valve thickening and centrally directed mitral regurgitation (Fig. 2D and Video 5).\nMyocardial edema can contribute to ventricu- lar wall thickening. It can occur in patients who are in a systemic edematous state due to renal failure6 or heart failure or in patients with acute myocarditis.7 However, the degree of myocardial wall thickening associated with edema or myo- carditis is milder than that observed in this pa- tient. His clinical presentation was not consistent with an edematous state or with acute illness. Systemic Diseases Associated with Ventricular Wall Thickening\nDoes this patient have a systemic, multiorgan disorder that is associated with biventricular wall thickening? He has a history of hypohidro- sis, reduced hearing, chronic dry eyes, constipa- tion, and renal insufficiency, all of which may be features of a systemic disease.\nBiventricular wall thickening can be associ- ated with cardiac amyloidosis, which occurs as part of a systemic disease \u2014 either light chain (AL) amyloidosis or transthyretin amyloidosis. Features of cardiac amyloidosis can include edema, ascites, and dyspnea due to restrictive cardiomyopathy; fatigue due to low cardiac out- put; and bradyarrhythmias and heart block. Heart failure usually progresses rapidly, especially in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis. Soft-tissue involvement is often apparent on physical exami- nation with either AL amyloidosis or transthyre- tin amyloidosis.8\nAL amyloidosis is caused by underlying plasma-\ncell dyscrasia. Transthyretin amyloidosis devel- ops when a protein made by the liver becomes unstable, which causes deposits of amyloid fi- brils to build up in the heart, nerves, and other organs. There is an autosomal dominant form of cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis that is most prevalent in persons of Afro-Caribbean origin, as well as a sporadic form that can develop in the elderly.9\nA striking feature of cardiac amyloidosis is the discrepancy between the wall thicknesses observed on echocardiography and the QRS volt- age observed on electrocardiography; the QRS voltage is classically reduced, although a pseudo- infarct pattern may be present. The feature of this patient\u2019s disease that makes cardiac amyloid- osis very unlikely is its indolent nature. The median survival associated with cardiac amyloid- osis is less than 4 years among untreated pa- tients and is even shorter among those with AL amyloidosis.10 Of note, other systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis and sarcoidosis are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, rather than with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nGenetic Disorders Associated with Ventricular Wall Thickening\nThere are various inherited systemic disorders that are associated with myocardial hypertrophy but also cause other, noncardiac dysmorphisms and manifest early in life. These include Noonan\u2019s syndrome and other disorders resulting from genetic mutations in the RAS\u2013MAPK signaling pathway (known as RASopathies).11 Mitochon- drial myopathies can be associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, but patients typically present at a younger age with proximal muscle weakness, ocular myopathy, and heart block; mitochondrial crisis may be precipitated by stress.12,13 Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, which is an auto- somal recessive disease resulting from a defect in FXN (the gene encoding the mitochondrial protein frataxin), can cause left ventricular hyper- trophy,14 but patients usually have ataxia from nervous system damage. Glycogen storage dis- ease type III, which results from a deficiency in glycogen debranching enzyme, can cause left ventricular hypertrophy, but patients usually present in childhood with hypoglycemia, short stature, and hepatomegaly.15\nLysosomal storage disorders that are associ-\nated with myocardial wall thickening include Danon\u2019s disease, Pompe\u2019s disease, mucopolysac- charidoses, and Fabry\u2019s disease. Danon\u2019s disease (or Danon\u2019s cardiomyopathy) is an X-linked dominant disease resulting from genetic defects in LAMP2 (the gene encoding lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2) that causes moderate-to-severe myocardial wall thickening, skeletal myopathy, and intellectual disability.16 Pompe\u2019s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by a deficiency in acid \u03b1-glucosidase, which leads to the intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen and an increase in myocardial mass. In both children and adults with this disorder, skeletal muscle weakness and respiratory muscle involvement are prominent features. Mucopolysac- charidoses are caused by defects of intralysosomal degradation of glycosaminoglycans. In addition to cardiomyopathy and mitral and aortic valve thickening, mitral annulus calcification and coarsening of skin and facial features are prom- inent findings, and they were not present in this patient.\nFabry\u2019s Disease\nFabry\u2019s disease is an X-linked inherited disor- der that is caused by a deficiency in lysosomal \u03b1-galactosidase A, which leads to the accumula- tion of glycosphingolipids (Fig. 3). The history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the patient\u2019s sister and niece, but not in his son, could be consistent with an X-linked inherited disorder. Fabry\u2019s disease is rare, and there is often a delay between symptom onset and diagnosis, with a mean delay of 14 years in men.17 A common clinical manifestation, and a potentially impor- tant clue in this case, is hypohidrosis. Another common manifestation is systemic hyperten- sion, which is often due to coexisting renal failure. The accumulation of globotriaosylcer- amide in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth-muscle cells leads to myocardial ische- mia, valve abnormalities, and myocardial wall thickening. Diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 2E and 2F) and heart failure can develop. Arrhythmias and conduction system disease commonly occur in patients with Fabry\u2019s disease. In this patient, the prolonged, gradually progressive course of myocardial wall thickening, the associated ar- rhythmias and conduction system disease, the valve thickening, the familial involvement (which is apparently most severe in the affected male family member), and the concurrent kidney dis- ease and hypohidrosis all make Fabry\u2019s disease the most likely diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Amel Karaa: The diagnostic test in this case was sequencing of 26 genes that are known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Genetic test- ing revealed a missense mutation in GLA (the gene encoding \u03b1-galactosidase A): c.901C\u2192G (p.Arg301Gly) in exon 6. This result was consis- tent with a diagnosis of Fabry\u2019s disease. The di- agnosis was further confirmed with testing for \u03b1-galactosidase A in plasma, which revealed no residual activity (0.0001 U per liter; reference range, 0.074 to 0.457).\nFabry\u2019s disease results from a deficiency in the activity of the glycohydrolase enzyme \u03b1-galac- tosidase A. The primary abnormality involves  the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in a variety of cell types, which starts in utero in the most severe cases. This accumulation of globo- triaosylceramide progresses over time and leads to end-organ damage. The organs that are most often affected include the heart (left ventricular wall thickening, arrhythmias, and fibrosis), the kidneys (glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria),and the central and peripheral nervous system (white-matter changes, strokes, and neuropa- thies). If untreated, the accumulation of globo- triaosylceramide can lead to premature death.18 In classic cases of Fabry\u2019s disease, symptom onset occurs in childhood and complications arise in adulthood.\n",
