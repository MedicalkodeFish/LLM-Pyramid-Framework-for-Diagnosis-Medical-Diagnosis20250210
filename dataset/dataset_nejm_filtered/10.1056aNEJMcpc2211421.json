    "Primary Symptom": "A 37-Year-Old Man with a Rash",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Stephanie Lin-Beckford (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a rash.\nThe patient had been well until 9 days before this admission, when a diffuse rash developed on the hands and feet. During the next 3 days, the rash spread proximally to the arms and the legs, then extended to the groin, trunk, and face. Six days before this admission, the patient noticed new throat tightness and lip swelling. Three days before this admission, when difficulty with swallowing and shortness of breath developed, the patient sought evaluation at the emergency de- partment of another hospital.\nOn evaluation at the other hospital, the patient reported that he had received an mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine on the day before the rash appeared. Vital signs and results of routine laboratory tests were reportedly normal. Treatment with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, famotidine, and intravenous fluids was administered. The patient was discharged home.\nDuring the next 3 days, the symptoms did not abate. On the day of this admis- sion, the patient sought evaluation in the emergency department of this hospital. He described having difficulty with opening his mouth because of pain in his lips, as well as mild difficulty with swallowing and breathing. The rash had become more confluent over the arms, legs, chest, back, face, and groin, and there was increased redness and swelling. The patient described the rash as mildly itchy and painful and stated that the affected skin felt \u201ctight.\u201d A review of systems was notable for fatigue, malaise, chills, and night sweats, as well as intermittent nausea, abdominal pain, watery stools, and dysuria. He had no fever, headache, cough, myalgias, or arthralgias.\nThe patient had no known medical conditions, took no medications, and had no known drug allergies. He was born in coastal South America and had immigrated to the United States 17 years before this admission. He lived in suburban New Eng- land with extended family members and had no pets; he had not traveled recently and had no known sick contacts. The patient worked in environmental services and wore gloves whenever he used cleaning products. He had smoked a half pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years; he did not drink al- cohol or use illicit drugs. He was sexually active and reported that his last episode of unprotected sexual intercourse had been with a female part- ner 2 years before this admission. No family members had autoimmune diseases or skin con- ditions.\nOn examination, the temporal temperature was 37.1\u00b0C, the heart rate 105 beats per minute, the blood pressure 138/92 mm Hg, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. There was fissuring at the oral com- missures, and the posterior oropharynx had a cobblestone appearance; no mucosal lesions were noted. There was no conjunctival injection. The lungs were clear on auscultation. No joint swell- ing or cervical lymphadenopathy was present, but he had nontender bilateral inguinal lymphade- nopathy. Morbilliform macules, papules, and plaques were observed on the arms, legs, chest, back, face, scalp, groin, and penis (Fig. 1). The rash became confluent at the dorsa and palms of the hands and at the dorsa and soles of the feet. No skin sloughing, erosions, ulcers, vesicles, or bullae were present. The complete blood count, blood levels of electrolytes, and results of tests of kidney and liver function were normal. The C-reactive protein level was 16.7 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to 8.0) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 30 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). Urinalysis was normal. Other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "Covid-19 Vaccination Reaction;Cutaneous Drug Reaction;Infectious Exanthem;Rash Affecting the Palms and Soles;HIV Infection and Syphilis",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Frank M. Volpicelli: This 37-year-old man had a 9-day history of a progressive, maculopapular rash involving the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (without desquamation), as well as mod- erate systemic symptoms and an elevated globu- lin gap (the difference between the total protein level and the total albumin level). In constructing a differential diagnosis, I will consider cutaneous drug reactions and infectious exanthems. Specifi- cally, I will consider rashes that affect the palms and soles.\n\nCovid-19 Vaccination Reaction\nThe patient\u2019s symptoms began 1 day after he had received a Covid-19 vaccine. It is common for patients to temporally associate Covid-19 vaccina- tion with the onset of a systemic illness, probably because of the sheer volume of Covid-19 vaccines that have been administered. The most common reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine is an early local site reaction that occurs within 1 to 2 days after vaccination; a late local reaction could occur up to 8 days after vaccination. Local site reactions typically occur after the first dose, and the sec- ond dose can be administered safely.1,2 In some cases, immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions occur; such reactions are characterized by urti- caria, flushing, and rarely, self-resolving chest or throat tightness. Although this patient presented with a rash and throat tightness, the extent of the rash and the duration of symptoms are not con- sistent with a local site reaction, hypersensitivity reaction, or anaphylactic reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nCutaneous Drug Reaction\nBecause of the appearance of this patient\u2019s rash, a morbilliform (also called maculopapular) drug eruption should be considered. A drug eruption is the most common drug hypersensitivity reaction. It usually occurs 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to a new drug, but it can occur sooner if the patient has been previously exposed to the drug. Mor- billiform drug eruptions tend to occur in a sym- metric distribution and often spread in a centrifu- gal manner, starting on the trunk and spreading out to the arms and legs. However, the direction of spread of this patient\u2019s rash is centripetal, in that it started on the hands and feet and spread toward the trunk.\nErythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity disorder that can be associated with medication but is most often associated with herpes simplex virus infection. This patient does not have the targetoid cutaneous rashes and mucosal bullae that are typical of erythema multiforme.\nAmong the most severe cutaneous drug reac- tions are the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. These conditions are char- acterized by extensive epidermal necrosis and sloughing and most often involve the mucous membranes in addition to the skin. The Stevens\u2013 Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis result in a spectrum of skin abnormalities: skin sloughing occurs in less than 10% of the body- surface area with the Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome and in greater than 30% with toxic epidermal necrolysis. This patient\u2019s rash is diffuse and widespread; however, he is unlikely to have ei- ther of these conditions because the mucous membranes are spared, there is no skin slough- ing, and he has had no recent exposures to new drugs.\nInfectious Exanthem\nOne of the most common causes of infectious exanthems is varicella\u2013zoster virus (VZV), which can cause either primary infection (chickenpox) or reactivation of latent virus, resulting in herpes zoster (shingles). Primary VZV infection is char- acterized by multiple crops of pruritic vesicles that appear in various stages of development and are distributed all over the body. Herpes zoster is characterized by a single or multiple crops of vesicles that are usually limited to a single der- matome, and their development is preceded by pain and burning. VZV infection is unlikely in this patient, given that his rash is morbilliform, rather than vesicular, in nature.\nMeasles causes a morbilliform rash, and lesions usually appear on the head and neck before spreading to the torso and the rest of the body. It is accompanied by fever, cough, coryza, and con- junctivitis, all of which are absent in this patient. Hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpan- gina are both associated with coxsackievirus in- fection, and fever and sore throat are common manifestations. The exanthem associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease manifests as pain- less, nonpruritic, macular, and maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the hands and feet that rarely spread centripetally. The oral lesions associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease are charac- terized by macules that progress to painful ves- icles and finally ulcers. This patient has a sore throat, but the rash is not consistent with hand, foot, and mouth disease or herpangina.\nCovid-19 causes a wide variety of cutaneous manifestations, including maculopapular and papulovesicular rashes, chilblain acral lesions (also known as \u201cCovid toes\u201d), vascular necrosis, purpura, petechiae, and livedo-like rashes. This patient had been well before his rash appeared, making Covid-19 an unlikely diagnosis.\n\nRash Affecting the Palms and Soles\nOne defining feature of this patient\u2019s rash is that it affects the palms and soles. The differential di- agnosis of rashes that affect the palms and soles is much more limited than that of maculopapular rashes.\nPatients with subacute bacterial endocarditis can present with petechiae and splinter hemor- rhages or with Janeway lesions (erythematous macules on the palms and soles) or Osler nodes (tender, violaceous nodules on the fingers and toes). These characteristics are the result of micro- vascular occlusion that is either acute or subacute in nature. Toxic shock syndrome can manifest with diffuse, red, macular rashes resembling sun- burns on the palms and soles that can progress to desquamation. Rocky Mountain spotted fever usually manifests with headache, high fever, and malaise, followed by the development of a rash within 24 to 72 hours. The rash is blanching and macular in appearance, starts on the ankles and wrists, and then spreads centripetally before ei- ther becoming petechial or, in its most severe form, progressing to confluent necrosis. Neither bacterial endocarditis nor Rocky Mountain spotted fever fits well with this patient\u2019s presentation.\n\nHIV Infection and Syphilis\nAcute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in- fection frequently manifests with systemic symp- toms, including fatigue, fever, myalgias, lymph- adenopathy, and pharyngitis or mucositis, which may cause oral ulcerations. Patients may also have headache, nausea, diarrhea, or a maculopapular rash that may involve the palms and soles. Many of the features of this patient\u2019s presentation fit neatly into the symptoms of acute or early HIV infection.\nWhen acute HIV infection is suspected, it is important to also consider coinfection with other sexually transmitted diseases. Many symptoms of acute HIV infection overlap with those of sec- ondary syphilis, including fatigue, malaise, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. The most severe cutaneous manifestation of secondary syphilis is an ulcerative skin condition known as lues ma- ligna, but the most common manifestation of secondary syphilis is a diffuse maculopapular rash that classically includes the palms and soles, as seen in this patient.\nThis patient\u2019s constitutional symptoms, glob- ulin gap, and diffuse maculopapular rash involv- ing the palms and soles make acute HIV infec- tion with or without secondary syphilis the most likely cause of his presentation. However, the sexual history that he reports would not be con- sistent with this presentation; therefore, I would recommend asking the patient again about his social history. To establish the diagnosis of acute HIV infection, I would perform a screening test for HIV antigen and antibody, as well as a test for HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA viral load. In addi- tion, I would perform a treponemal-specific test to screen for syphilis.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. E. Zachary Nussbaum: The patient underwent nucleic acid amplification testing for Covid-19, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, as well as serologic evaluation for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr vi- rus, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. Blood cultures were also obtained. The results of the Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus tests were consistent with past infection, and  the remainder of the tests were negative. A screening test for HIV-1 antigen and HIV-1 and HIV type 2 (HIV-2) antibodies was positive.\nA screening assay that detects HIV p24 antigen in addition to antibodies is the initial test of choice for the diagnosis of HIV infection, since it can detect evidence of infection earlier than antibody tests alone. HIV p24 antigen is typically detectable approximately 15 to 20 days after viral infection, whereas HIV antibodies generally are not detectable until 20 to 30 days after infection.3 Thus, combination antigen\u2013antibody assays en- hance the sensitivity for diagnosing acute HIV infection, which is defined as the period of HIV infection before the development and detection of HIV-specific antibodies. However, a positive screening assay alone does not establish the di- agnosis of HIV infection. The positive predictive value of the assay is dependent on the prevalence of HIV within the population of the patient be- ing tested. On the basis of the history we are given, this patient does not appear to be from a community with particularly high HIV preva- lence, which further highlights the importance  of confirming the diagnosis with an HIV-1 and HIV-2 differentiation immunoassay, as is recom- mended for all patients with a positive screening test.4\nIn this case, the HIV differentiation assay was\npositive for HIV-1, thus confirming the diagno- sis of HIV-1 infection. The patient\u2019s HIV-1 RNA viral load was 3,420,000 copies per milliliter of plasma, and the CD4+ T-cell count was 700 per microliter (reference range, 500 to 1500). HIV-1 RNA levels that are elevated to this degree typi- cally occur during acute or early HIV infection but may occur late in the disease course. Given the preserved CD4+ T-cell count, the patient had most likely acquired the infection recently; how- ever, his infection did not meet the definition for acute HIV infection because the differentiation assay confirmed the presence of HIV-1 antibod- ies and therefore documented that seroconver- sion had occurred.\nAlthough nonspecific, the elevated globulin gap and lymphopenia observed in this case were clues to the diagnosis. A globulin gap of greater than 4 g per deciliter is often observed in pa-  tients with HIV infection and reflects polyclonal B-cell activation.5 Lymphopenia is common even in the early stages of infection and is typically associated with an inversion of the CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio.6\nThe patient also underwent testing for syphilis. Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphi- lis, cannot be visualized with the use of Gram\u2019s staining or standard microscopy. Although  it can be visualized with dark-field microscopy, this test is highly operator-dependent and dark-field microscopes are unavailable in many clinical labo- ratories. As such, syphilis diagnostics rely on se- rologic tests, which can be categorized as treponemal and nontreponemal tests. Owing to the fact that treponemal tests are more sensitive than nontreponemal tests in early disease and have higher overall specificity, many clinical laborato- ries have adopted the \u201creverse\u201d screening algo- rithm, in which the initial screening test is a treponemal test.7 This patient underwent initial testing with a treponemal IgM and IgG immu- noassay, which showed a positive result.\nAs with HIV diagnostic testing, the initial di- agnosis of syphilis cannot be made with a single serologic test; confirmation with an additional serologic assay is required. A positive treponemal test should be confirmed with a nontreponemal test; the most common such test is the rapid  plasma reagin (RPR) test, which detects antibod- ies against lipid antigens, as opposed to antibod- ies against the bacterium itself. Nontreponemal tests, which lack specificity, are positive in ap- proximately 2% of persons tested in the United States. False positive nontreponemal tests are particularly common in pregnant women and in persons with liver disease or other acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. An advantage of nontreponemal tests is that the results are reported as a titer, which can be tracked over time to assess therapeutic response. This patient had a positive RPR test, with a titer of 1:8. Be- cause the patient had never received a diagnosis of syphilis, this result confirms the diagnosis.\nIt is not possible to definitively know the stage of syphilis that this result represents. Clinically, the patient\u2019s rash is highly suggestive of second- ary syphilis, although it should be noted that RPR titers are typically higher during this stage of infection.\n\n\n",
