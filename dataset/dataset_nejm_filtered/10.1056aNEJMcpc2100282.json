    "Primary Symptom": "A 48-Year-Old Man with Fatigue and Leg Swelling",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Jonathan R. Wing: A 48-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of fatigue and swelling in both legs.\nThe patient had been well until 8 months before the current admission, when fatigue and lethargy developed. He thought the fatigue was associated with alcohol consumption and reduced his intake to 12 beers weekly; before this, he had con- sumed 24 beers weekly for 15 years. Three months before the current admission, the patient\u2019s weight had decreased by 9.1 kg. However, 3 weeks before this admis- sion, the weight had increased by 9.6 kg and swelling developed in both legs. He thought the weight gain was related to diet changes, including consumption of pizza, pasta, and soup, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nOne week before the current admission, the patient was evaluated by his pri- mary care physician. He was instructed to elevate his legs, wear compression stockings, and decrease dietary sodium to 2 g daily. On the day of the current admission, the leg swelling had not abated and new abdominal distention oc- curred. He called the primary care clinic and was instructed to seek evaluation at the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation, a review of systems was notable for fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, abdominal bloating, constipation, penile swelling, decreased libido, in- tolerance of cold temperatures, and ankle and knee pain in both legs that was worse when the patient was climbing stairs. There was no fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, or hematochezia.\nSixteen months before the current evaluation, the patient had been admitted to this hospital with pneumonia involving the right upper and middle lobes that was due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. During that admission, he received diagnoses of diabetes and normocytic anemia. After discharge from the hospital, laboratory evaluation revealed a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.1% (reference range, 4.3 to 6.4). Metformin was prescribed, and follow-up evaluation was recommended; how- ever, the patient had not returned to the primary care clinic before the current illness.\nThe patient had not started taking metformin\nuntil 3 weeks before the current evaluation; he took no other medications and had no known drug allergies. He lived with his wife and two children in an urban area of New England. He did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His mother had Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia; he did not know the health of his father or pa- ternal half-siblings.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 98/54 mm Hg, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.3. The patient did not have jaun- dice, scleral icterus, or spider angiomas. He had jugular venous distention and an S3 gallop; there\nwere no rales. The abdomen was distended, with\ndullness on percussion of the flanks; there was no hepatosplenomegaly. There was 2+ symmet- ric pitting edema in the lower legs up to the knees. Mild palmar erythema was present; there was no asterixis.\nThe blood glucose level was 402 mg per deci- liter (22.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 70 to 110 mg per deciliter [3.9 to 6.1 mmol per liter]); the glycated hemoglobin level was 11.6%. The platelet count was 82,000 per microliter (refer- ence range, 150,000 to 400,000). Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Reece J. Goiffon: Radiography of the chest re- vealed new elevation of the right hemidiaphragm and atelectasis in the lower lobes. Ultrasonogra- phy with Doppler analysis of the abdomen re- vealed mild thickening of the gallbladder wall, coarsened liver echotexture, moderate ascites, and mild splenomegaly; the portal veins were patent. Duplex ultrasonography revealed nonocclusive deep-vein thrombosis of the right popliteal vein.\nDr. Wing: Paracentesis was performed with ultrasonographic guidance, and 50 ml of perito- neal fluid was drained. Results of peritoneal fluid analysis are shown in Table 1; cytologic examination of the fluid revealed no malignant cells. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with occasional premature atrial com- plexes, left axis deviation, and T-wave inversions in leads I and aVL. Insulin and enoxaparin were administered subcutaneously, and the patient was admitted to the hospital. A diagnostic test was performed.\n\nTable 1.

Abdominal and Cardiac MRI. Abdominal MRI was performed. Out\u2011of\u2011phase and in\u2011 phase T1\u2011weighted images (Panels A and B, respectively) show selective signal loss in the liver (L) and pancreas\n(P), as compared with the spleen (S) and kidneys (K). An R2* map (Panel C) localizes increased signal decay to the liver and quantifies the signal decay rate, which is mathematically related to the iron content; the liver was found to contain 10 mg of iron per gram of dry weight. Cardiac MRI was also performed. Images ob\u2011 tained in a four\u2011chamber long\u2011axis view at end diastole and end systole (Panels D and E, respectively) show globally reduced right ventricular (RV) and left ventricu\u2011 lar (LV) ejection fractions (31%). A T2*\u2011weighted image (Panel F) shows signal loss in the liver and left ventricu\u2011 lar wall, as compared with the spleen and skeletal mus\u2011 cle (SM); in the left ventricular wall, T2* (the observed transverse relaxation constant) was decreased, at 8 to 10 msec.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Amber B. Moore: This 48-year-old man with a history of substantial alcohol use presented with new edema of the lower legs, diabetes, subacute fatigue, joint pain, and loss of libido. The results of liver-enzyme tests were abnormal, and the findings on abdominal imaging were suggestive of chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis. I will formulate a differential diagnosis in two steps. First, I will use a pathophysiological approach to define broad categories of conditions that can cause edema. Then, I will incorporate other de- tails provided in this case to narrow the list to a likely diagnosis.\n\nEdema\nEdema develops when there is a net efflux of fluid from the intravascular space into the inter- stitial space. There are four common mechanisms associated with edema formation: increased hydro- static pressure, increased membrane permeability, decreased oncotic pressure, and decreased lym- phatic drainage. The underlying cause of any of these mechanisms determines the distribution of the edema. Vascular or lymphatic obstruction typically results in a focal area of edema, where- as a disorder of albumin production, a decrease in osmolality due to kidney excretion, or a lack of absorption in the gut results in symmetric diffuse edema. Increased plasma volume due to renal sodium retention, which can occur in the presence of heart failure or liver disease, results in symmetric dependent edema. Increased hydro- static pressure due to heart failure typically causes edema distally. This patient had no evi- dence of renal disease or protein-losing enter- opathy, and therefore, a primary hepatic or car- diac process (or a combination of the two) is the most likely explanation of his edema. Processes that affect both the liver and the heart should be considered.\nAlcohol Use Disorder\nThis patient is at increased risk for alcoholic cir- rhosis, which is the most likely cause of liver disease in a middle-aged man with a history of substantial alcohol consumption. This possibility is further supported by the aspartate aminotrans- ferase level (which was elevated and greater than the alanine aminotransferase level), thrombocy- topenia, leukopenia, macrocytosis, abdominal distention, and findings on abdominal ultraso- nography, including coarsened liver echotexture, ascites, and splenomegaly. Furthermore, diagnos- tic paracentesis with peritoneal f luid analysis revealed a serum ascites albumin gradient of 2.9 g per deciliter, a finding consistent with portal hypertension. Before the chronic liver disease can be attributed to alcohol use, other causes \u2014 in- cluding viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune hepatitis \u2014 should be ruled out. The patient\u2019s history of alcohol use also increases his risk for alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which can result in congestive hepatopathy and lower-leg edema. Although alcohol use may be contribut- ing to this patient\u2019s presentation, it is unlikely to explain the full constellation of symptoms, in- cluding the elevated glycated hemoglobin level, joint pain, and loss of libido.\nMycoplasma Pneumonia\nThis patient had recently been hospitalized with an episode of pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumonia typically causes mild and self-limited infection in patients who are otherwise healthy, relatively young, and immuno- competent. The fact that this patient\u2019s illness was severe enough to result in hospital admis- sion is notable and may suggest a predisposition to infection. Furthermore, the possibility that symptoms arising after the infection could be caused by mycoplasma is worth considering. IgM-mediated hemolysis is a common complica- tion of mycoplasma infection and could have caused anemia at the time of the initial hospitali- zation. Persistence of subclinical cold-agglutinin disease could explain the ongoing fatigue, cold intolerance, and possibly even the development of deep-vein thrombosis, given the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia.1 However, this patient did not have anemia at the time of the current presentation, and a laboratory evaluation for hemolysis was unremarkable. Of note, the rapid increase in the glycated hemoglobin level could also be due to hemolysis, with red-cell turnover causing a falsely low initial glycated hemoglobin level. In addition, mycoplasma in- fection has known, albeit uncommon, cardiac manifestations, including myocarditis, which can lead to heart failure. Although this patient had symptoms that could be consistent with myco- plasma infection, the manifestation of symp-\n \n\ntoms many months after the initial infection would be unusual, so this diagnosis is unlikely.\n\nVenous Thromboembolism\nThis patient was found to have deep-vein throm- bosis in the lower leg on presentation. This find- ing could represent either a complication of his recent fatigue and immobility or a clue to the underlying process that led to his current pre- sentation. Thromboembolic disease can cause pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular heart strain, and right ventricular heart failure; how- ever, this diagnosis is less likely in the absence of dyspnea. That said, obstruction of the iliac vein or inferior vena cava alone could cause lower-leg edema, and portal vein thrombosis may cause ascites. That the patient was not found to have portal vein thrombosis is reassuring; iliac vein thrombosis would not explain his entire clinical presentation.\n\nDiabetes\nThe patient\u2019s elevated glycated hemoglobin level and new diagnosis of diabetes have yet to be explained. Although diabetes can develop inde- pendently in a person with known prediabetes and risk factors, this patient\u2019s rapid increase in the glycated hemoglobin level in association with new edema, fatigue, joint pain, and cold intoler- ance suggests a systemic process. An infiltrative process affecting the heart, liver, and pancreas should be considered, with potential causes in- cluding sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and hemochro- matosis. Sarcoidosis is unlikely in the absence of pulmonary symptoms and specific abnormalities on imaging. Amyloidosis can cause both cardiac and liver disease, as well as joint disease; how- ever, amyloid deposition does not typically cause pancreatic disease and diabetes. Given that this patient\u2019s presentation is not suggestive of sar- coidosis or amyloidosis, the most likely diagno- sis is hemochromatosis.\nHereditary Hemochromatosis\nHereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of in- creased iron absorption that results in total body iron overload and iron deposition in the heart, liver, joints, and pancreas. Manifestations typi- cally occur in the fourth or fifth decade of life in men, which is consistent with this patient\u2019s presentation. The liver is the organ most com- monly affected, and excessive alcohol use is a risk factor for the development of liver disease in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Iron deposition in both the heart and the liver can contribute to organ dysfunction and cause edema. The presence of extrahepatic manifestations is suggestive of clinically significant iron deposi- tion in the myocardium and heart failure; review of an echocardiogram would help to confirm the presence of heart failure. Iron deposition in the pancreas is a likely cause of new-onset diabetes. Iron deposition in the pituitary can cause hypo- pituitarism and decreased libido. Hypopituitarism may also result in hypothyroidism; given the pa- tient\u2019s history of cold intolerance, constipation, and lethargy, a thyrotropin level should be ob- tained. The severe illness due to mycoplasma infection could have resulted from increased susceptibility to infection in the context of heredi- tary hemochromatosis; however, such increased susceptibility to infection is more commonly associated with siderophilic bacteria.2,3\nCan the development of deep-vein thrombosis\nbe explained by a diagnosis of hereditary hemo- chromatosis? Small studies have shown an in- creased prevalence of the factor V Leiden muta- tion (associated with deep-vein thrombosis) among patients with a specific mutation of the HFE gene (associated with hereditary hemochro- matosis),4 but this correlation is not well estab- lished.5 I suspect that the deep-vein thrombosis in this patient is more likely to have resulted from his immobility due to symptoms of heredi- tary hemochromatosis. An elevated ferritin level and an elevated transferrin saturation (serum iron level divided by total iron-binding capacity) would help to establish the diagnosis of heredi- tary hemochromatosis; however, the definitive test result would be detection of an HFE mutation.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Joseph Misdraji: The diagnostic test was HFE ge- netic testing, which revealed homozygous C282Y mutations of the HFE gene. This is the most com- mon genetic abnormality in patients with heredi- tary hemochromatosis, but it is not the only one. HFE genetic testing in clinical laboratories often involves techniques that detect common mutations only. In our laboratory, HFE genetic testing is performed with an allelic discrimination assay that detects C282Y or H63D mutations.The patient underwent a liver biopsy. Examina- tion of the biopsy specimen revealed cirrhosis. On an iron stain, there was 4+ iron deposition in hepatocytes (Fig. 2). There was also iron de- position in epithelial cells of the bile ducts, a finding that is characteristic of but not specific for hereditary hemochromatosis. Mild steatosis was noted, without features of steatohepatitis. A separate core biopsy specimen of liver tissue was sent for iron quantification, which revealed a he- patic iron concentration of 15,642 \u03bcg per gram (reference range, 200 to 2400). Because the he- patic iron concentration increases over a person\u2019s lifetime, the result can be adjusted for age with calculation of the hepatic iron index. In this case, the hepatic iron index was 5.8 \u03bcmol of iron per gram of liver tissue per year. In the past, before HFE genetic testing was commonly available, a hepatic iron index of greater than 1.9 was used to establish the diagnosis of hereditary hemochroma- tosis; values above this threshold were considered to be highly specific for genetic iron overload.\n\nFigure 2.
