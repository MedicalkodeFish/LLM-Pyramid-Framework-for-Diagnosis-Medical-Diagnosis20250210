    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Sara R. Schoenfeld: A 44-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of joint pain, unintentional weight loss, and chest pain.\nTen months before admission, arthralgias developed in the shoulders.tAGbyyxt After 2 months of discomfort, the patient was evaluated by a rheumatologist at another hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulders was reportedly nor- mal. Piroxicam was prescribed, and glucocorticoid injections to the shoulders were administered. During the next 4 months, arthralgias developed in the fingers and knees. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made by the rheumatologist. Naproxen was prescribed at a dose of 250 to 500 mg two or three times daily, as needed, and additional glucocorticoid injections to the shoulders were administered.\nSix weeks before admission, anorexia, odynophagia, and epigastric pain devel- oped. Two weeks later, the patient began to have episodic anterior pleuritic pain, which was characterized as sharp and was worse when he was in the supine posi- tion; he also had intermittent dyspnea and nonproductive cough. He had fatigue that was sometimes severe enough to prevent him from getting out of bed. One week before admission, subjective fevers and increased dyspnea occurred.\nOne day before admission, the patient\u2019s sister thought that the patient appeared weak and ill and took him to the emergency department of a second hospital. Laboratory test results were notable for a white-cell count of 2000 per cubic milli- meter (normal range, 4500 to 11,000) and a hematocrit of 21% (normal range, 41 to 53). Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Andrew S. Fox: A posteroanterior chest radiograph showed an enlarged car- diac silhouette, changes consistent with small bilateral pleural effusions, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed small-volume ascites with peritoneal enhancement (Fig. 1B), a moderate- to-large circumferential pericardial effusion, and small bilateral pleural effusions (Fig. 1C).\nDr. Schoenfeld: The patient was transferred to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and treatment. A review of systems was notable for fatigue, mild bilateral joint pain, pleuritic pain, intermittent dyspnea, nonproductive cough, anorexia, odynophagia,an unintentional weight loss of 18 kg during the past year, polyuria, and a pruritic rash on the arms that had some sloughing and spared the hands. He had no night sweats, chills, melena, hematochezia, diarrhea, photosensitivity, dry eyes or mouth, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, urinary symptoms, penile lesion or discharge, orthopnea, or edema.\nThe patient\u2019s medical history was notable for malaria and depression. Medications included bupropion and naproxen as needed. Diphenhydra- mine had caused oral and facial swelling and pruritus. The patient was born and raised in sub-Saharan Africa and had immigrated to New England 18 years earlier; he had not traveled outside the United States in 15 years. He was currently unemployed. He was divorced and had been sexually active with women, most recently 7 months before the current presentation. He lived with his sister and his two young children; one son had had symptoms of an upper respira- tory infection 2 weeks earlier. The patient re- ported that he had had a 7-year period of heavy beer drinking but had been abstinent for almost 20 years; he had smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 12 years but had quit 15 years earlier. There was no history of illicit drug use. There was no family history of heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, tuber- culosis, autoimmune disease, or cancer.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.7\u00b0C,\nthe heart rate 100 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure 93/57 mm Hg (pulsus paradoxus, 12 mm Hg), the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The height was 173 cm, the weight 54.3 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 18.1. The patient had signs of chronic illness, including cachexia and bitemporal wasting. The jugular venous pressure was 14 cm of water. He had a yellow coating on the tongue but no lesions in the mouth. He had scaling and dry skin on the arms and chest but no overt rash. Diffuse subcentimeter lymph nodes in the cervical chain were palpable, as were larger bilateral axillary lymph nodes. The heart rhythm was tachycardic and distant, and the lungs were clear. There was mild epigastric tenderness, with- out rebound or guarding. Shoulder abduction was limited to 90 degrees bilaterally, and there was pain on external rotation. The knees were warm, with moderate effusions, and there was pain on knee flexion. The patient had synovitis and tenderness of the wrists and proximal inter- phalangeal joints. The rest of the examination was normal.\nResults of blood tests for phosphorus, magneplastin time 36.4 seconds (normal range, 22.0 to 35.0), and the prothrombin-time international normalized ratio 1.1 (normal range, 0.9 to 1.1). Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Fox: CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlargement of the bilateral pleural ef- fusions to a moderate size, with loculation of pleural effusions on the right side, as well as enlargement of the pericardial effusion (Fig. 1D). There were enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes (Fig. 1E).\nDr. Schoenfeld: On the fourth day, the patient\u2019s temperature was 38.8\u00b0C. The heart rate increased to 120 beats per minute, and the systolic blood pressure was 80 to 90 mm Hg.\nDr. Tanguturi: Repeat echocardiography revealed preserved left ventricular function. There was a large circumferential pericardial effusion (mea- suring 3 cm); the pericardial effusion was larger than it had been on the echocardiogram ob- tained 3 days earlier and was causing diastolic inversion of the right ventricular free wall and right atrium (Fig. 2). The presence of right ven- tricular diastolic inversion suggests increased intrapericardial pressure and a 20% decrease in cardiac output, and the presence of right atrial compression during more than one third of the cardiac cycle is nearly 100% sensitive and spe- cific for tamponade.1 There was diffuse fibrin deposition along the visceral pericardium, a find- ing suggestive of chronicity. There was respiro- phasic variation of 40% in the Doppler-flow velocities across the mitral valve. Respirophasic variation of at least 30% in the Doppler-flow velocities across the mitral valve is considered to be suggestive of cardiac tamponade caused by increased filling of the right ventricle during inspiration, with compression of the right ven- tricular free wall and subsequent decreased fill- ing of the left ventricle.1 There was new dilata- tion of the inferior vena cava without compression during inspiration, a finding suggestive of ele- vated pressures on the right side of the heart.\nCatheterization of the right side of the heart\nrevealed elevation and equalization of diastol- ic pressures, with a right atrial pressure of 20 mm Hg, a right ventricular end-diastolic pres- sure of 24 mm Hg, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 20 mm Hg; these findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade. Pericardiosium, bilirubin, amylase, lipase, and thyrotropin were normal; additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was notable for yellow, slightly cloudy urine, with 1+ urobilino- gen (normal value, negative), 2+ protein (normal value, negative), 0 to 2 erythrocytes per high- power field (normal range, 0 to 2), and 3 to 5 leu- kocytes per high-power field (normal range, <10). An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 96 beats per minute, subtle PR-segment depression, and borderline low limb-lead voltage. A chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette and small bilateral pleural effusions. Echocardiography was performed.\nDr. Varsha K. Tanguturi: Echocardiography re-\nvealed normal left ventricular size and function. There was a moderate-sized pericardial effusion with diffuse fibrin deposition. There was brief right ventricular diastolic inversion without sub- stantial respirophasic variation (i.e., variation from expiration to inspiration) in the intracardiac Doppler-flow velocities. The inferior vena cava was not dilated.\nDr. Schoenfeld: Intravenous normal saline and esomeprazole were administered, and the pa- tient was admitted to the cardiology unit of this hospital.\nOn the second day, the patient\u2019s temperature reached 39.1\u00b0C. Blood specimens were obtained for culture, and an induced-sputum specimen was obtained for microbiologic studies, including mycobacterial smear and culture. Testing of a nasopharyngeal sample was negative for influ- enza A and B. Screening tests for HIV types 1 and 2 and HIV p24 antigen, antibodies to Lyme dis- ease, and heterophile antibodies were negative. Serologic testing for IgG antibodies to cytomega- lovirus was positive. A purified protein derivative was planted to assess for a response to Mycobacte- rium tuberculosis antigens. The systolic blood pres- sure remained within a range of 90 to 100 mm Hg, with the heart rate ranging from 100 to 110 beats per minute; runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred, the longest of which was 28 beats. Intravenous magnesium and amioda- rone were administered.\nOn the third day, the patient\u2019s temperature\nreached 39.7\u00b0C. The systolic blood pressure re- mained within a range of 90 to 100 mm Hg, and runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per- sisted. The prothrombin time was 14.5 seconds (normal range, 11.0 to 14.0), the partial-thrombocentesis was notable for retrieval of 570 ml of bloody fluid, which reduced the intrapericardial pressure from 18 mm Hg to 3 mm Hg.\nDr. Schoenfeld: Gram\u2019s staining of the pericar- dial fluid revealed abundant neutrophils and very few mononuclear cells but no organisms. The glucose level was 77 mg per deciliter (4.3 mmol per liter), the lactate dehydrogenase level 1487 U per liter, and the total protein level 4.0 g per deciliter. The red-cell count was 18,000 per cubic millimeter, and the nucleated-cell count 9439 per cubic millimeter, 93% of which were neutro- phils. Microbiologic culture of the pericardial fluid was also performed. Cytologic examination of the pericardial fluid for malignant cells was negative, as were additional blood tests, includ- ing an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for tuberculosis and tests for rheumatoid factor, antitreponemal antibodies, antibodies to hepatitis B virus, and IgM antibodies to parvovirus.\n\nFigure 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sheila L. Arvikar: Many features of this patient\u2019s presentation are nonspecific, but the disease process that involved the pericardium and caused tamponade deserves foremost consideration and will probably provide key clues that point us to- ward the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis of pericarditis and pericardial effusion varies on the basis of geography. In the United States, approxi- mately 80% of cases of pericarditis are idio- pathic, 5 to 10% are due to cancer, 2 to 7% are due to autoimmune or pericardial-injury syndromes,\n4% are due to tuberculosis, and less than 1% are due to a purulent bacterial infection.2 However, in developing countries, the epidemiology of peri- cardial disease is quite different, such that 70% of cases are attributed to tuberculosis. Does the nature of this patient\u2019s pericardial effusion pro- vide us with any clues? The pericardial effusion was fibrinous, exudative, and neutrophilic, but these features are not helpful in distinguishing the cause. Tamponade, however, may be more often associated with infection and cancer than with other causes. The presence of a bloody ef- fusion may also suggest tuberculosis and cancer. This patient did not have drug exposures, abnor- mal renal function, recent trauma, or invasive procedures that would explain the development of pericarditis. Thus, we are left with infection, cancer, and inflammatory diseases as the major diagnostic considerations in this case.\nInfection\nThe patient was originally from sub-Saharan Africa, and therefore, particular consideration needs to be given to infections common in that region of the world. He had clinically significant constitutional symptoms, including fevers and weight loss, which suggest the possibility of tuberculosis. However, he had no family history or other findings suggestive of tuberculosis. His interferon-\u03b3 release assay was negative, but the sensitivity of this test in patients with active tuber- culosis can vary, depending on the site of infec- tion and the patient\u2019s immune status. The dura- tion of his illness would be rather long for a viral infection. The presence of odynophagia could be suggestive of esophageal candidiasis, which can occur in patients with HIV infection, but HIV testing was negative; odynophagia could also be attributed to esophageal compression by the large pericardial effusion. Furthermore, although the patient had leukopenia at presentation, he was not known to be immunocompromised. He had not recently been in any areas in which fungal or parasitic infections are endemic. The negative Gram\u2019s stain of the pericardial fluid is reassur- ing and is not consistent with a typical bacterial infection.\nCancer\nFevers, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, along with hematologic abnormalities, are suggestive of cancer. Lymphoma, metastatic disease, and mesothelioma are possible causes of malignant pericardial effusion. However, the patient\u2019s im- aging studies did not suggest a primary source of cancer, and cytologic examination of the peri- cardial fluid was negative. Although he had for- merly smoked tobacco, he had no known expo- sure to asbestos; the absence of asbestos exposure decreases the likelihood of mesothelioma. The enlarged bilateral axillary lymph nodes on CT may be revealing and will need to be investi- gated further.\n\nRheumatic Disease\nCould the patient have a rheumatic disease? The joint symptoms at the onset of illness, anemia, lymphopenia, and elevated levels of ferritin and inflammatory mediators are suggestive of an autoimmune process. The rheumatic diseases that are most commonly associated with pericardial involvement include systemic lupus erythemato- sus, rheumatoid arthritis, adult-onset Still\u2019s dis- ease, and systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis is unlikely in this case, given the absence of Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and sclerodactyly. The absence of hilar lymphadenopathy and pulmo- nary infiltrates makes sarcoidosis unlikely. The patient had no muscle weakness suggestive of inflammatory myopathy or sicca symptoms sug- gestive of Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. He had no history of oral and genital ulcers typical of Beh\u00e7et\u2019s dis- ease or bowel symptoms suggestive of inflam- matory bowel disease. The absence of vasculitic rash, neuropathy, and hematuria makes vasculi- tis an unlikely diagnosis.\nRheumatoid arthritis, adult-onset Still\u2019s dis-\nease, and systemic lupus erythematosus could all explain the joint symptoms, pericarditis, fe- vers, anemia, and lymphadenopathy. Leukopenia is more typical of systemic lupus erythematosus than of the other conditions, but it can occur in certain forms of rheumatoid arthritis and adult- onset Still\u2019s disease.\n\nRheumatoid Arthritis\nThis patient had some features that are not typical of rheumatoid arthritis, including a joint distribution with predominant involvement of large joints. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis usually present with symmetric polyarthritis that affects small joints in the hands and feet. Pericarditis can occur in rheumatoid arthritis, but peri- tonitis is rare. Although a test for rheumatoid factor was negative in this case, we are not pro- vided with results of a test for anti\u2013citrullinated protein antibodies. Patients with severe extra- articular involvement are often seropositive for rheumatoid autoantibodies, particularly rheuma- toid factor.3 Finally, the patient had leukopenia, which can develop in the context of Felty\u2019s syn- drome4 \u2014 a rare disorder, characterized by the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia, that usually occurs in patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis who are pos- itive for rheumatoid factor. However, this patient had lymphopenia rather than neutropenia, and he did not have splenomegaly on clinical examination or abdominal imaging.\n\nAdult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease\nThe constellation of arthritis, serositis, and fevers, along with the elevated serum ferritin level and abnormal results on liver-function tests, may fit better with the diagnosis of adult-onset Still\u2019s disease. The patient did not have the typical eva- nescent rash that usually occurs with fever. Leukopenia is not a typical feature of adult-onset Still\u2019s disease; in fact, leukocytosis is one of the major criteria for diagnosis.5 However, leukopenia can occur in the presence of the macrophage activation syndrome, a form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis that can develop in the con- text of rheumatic disorders, most frequently systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult- onset Still\u2019s disease. Patients with this syndrome generally have a low-to-normal erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate, whereas the rate was markedly elevated (105 mm per hour) in this patient. In addition, in patients with hemophagocytic lym- phohistiocytosis, cytopenias usually involve all three cell lineages, and neutropenia, rather than lymphopenia, is a diagnostic feature.6\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus\nOne might not initially suspect a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in this case, given that 90% of affected patients are female. How- ever, this diagnosis could explain all the features of this patient\u2019s presentation, including the ar- thritis, pericarditis and other types of serositis, fevers, lymphadenopathy, lymphopenia, anemia, and possible renal involvement. The incidence\n \nand prevalence of lupus are highest among per- sons of African descent.7 Lupus is more severe in persons of African descent than in persons of European descent,8,9 and serositis is more com- mon.10 In addition, the disease is more severe and hematologic abnormalities and serositis are more common in men than in women.11\nLupus may affect any organ and is a clinically heterogeneous disease. Constitutional symptoms, rashes, arthritis, and serositis are common mani- festations. Another hallmark feature is immuno- logic abnormalities, such as an elevated level of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). Pericarditis is the most common cardiac manifestation of lupus. Symptomatic pericarditis may develop in 25% of patients and is often accompanied by pleuritis; subclinical pericarditis is even more common.12 Tamponade, however, is rare, occurring in 1 to 2.5% of patients with lupus.13,14 In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, tamponade has been associated with hemolytic anemia, renal dis- ease, hypocomplementemia, and female sex.14,15 The pericardial fluid is typically a neutrophilic, inflammatory exudate.14\nThe diagnosis of systemic lupus erythemato-\nsus is based on clinical and laboratory features. There are no formal diagnostic criteria. However, classification criteria, including the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria16 and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria,17 are helpful in consider- ing the diagnosis. This patient meets at least three clinical criteria (Table 2); he may meet more criteria, depending on the results of addi- tional immunologic studies, such as ANA and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody testing. It is unclear whether he had any compo- nent of hemolysis in addition to anemia of chronic disease. He had mild coagulation abnor- malities, but his status with regard to antiphos- pholipid antibodies is unknown. Proteinuria was noted on urinalysis, but further details are not described. Finally, his reported rash with scaling could suggest discoid lupus erythematosus but could also be an incidental condition, such as eczema or tinea.\nIn summary, I think this patient\u2019s clinical presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. To establish this diagnosis, additional testing is needed, in- cluding tests for ANAs, anti-dsDNA antibodies,and complement levels. Measurement of the urine protein level and examination of urinary sediment would help to determine whether there is renal involvement. I would also perform further test- ing for hemolysis, including a direct Coombs\u2019 test, as well as testing for antiphospholipid anti- bodies. Regardless of the immunologic test re- sults, it would be necessary to rule out alterna- tive diagnoses, such as tuberculosis and cancer. To that end, examination of the pericardial fluid for acid-fast bacilli and a lymph node biopsy should be performed\n\nTable 2.

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Lena D. Stuart: The diagnostic laboratory tests in this case were the ANA and anti-dsDNA antibody tests, both of which were positive. The ANA test showed homogeneous nuclear staining, with intense staining of the chromosomal regions of cells in mitosis, and was positive up to the high- est dilution (1:5120). A homogeneous ANA pat- tern is seen in most patients with systemic lupus erythematosus but can also been seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, and other autoimmune dis- eases. This pattern is produced by anti-dsDNA antibodies, histone\u2013DNA complexes, and other histones.18 The anti-dsDNA antibody assay was positive up to a dilution of 1:80. A positive anti- dsDNA antibody test is specific for systemic lupus erythematosus and distinguishes it from most forms of drug-induced lupus, which would gen- erally be associated with a negative anti-dsDNA antibody test.\nBiopsy of an axillary lymph node was subse-\nquently performed, and examination of the biopsy specimen revealed a moderately enlarged lymph node with mostly preserved architecture and scattered lymphoid follicles, areas of paracortical hyperplasia, and patent sinuses (Fig. 3A). There were foci of necrosis with apoptotic debris and many histiocytes, including some with vacuolated cytoplasm (Fig. 3B). No granulocytes were pres- ent in the necrotic foci, and no granulomas or viral inclusions were seen. There were clusters of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. On flow cytometry, no clonal B-cell population or unusual T-cell population was present. Immunostains showed a normal distribution of B cells and T cells; there were many CD20+ B cells in follicles and along sinuses, as well as many interfollicular CD3+ T cells, which were appropriately composed of more CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3C and 3D). Immunohistochemical staining for kappa and lambda immunoglobulin light chains showed many scattered polytypic plasma cells. Staining for CD123 showed clusters of plasmacytoid den- dritic cells.\nIn summary, these findings are consistent\nwith reactive lymphoid hyperplasia with foci of necrosis and no evidence of cancer. This histopathological appearance is most consistent with Kikuchi\u2019s disease or lupus lymphadenitis, entities that are essentially indistinguishable on the basis of histologic features alone. The presence of hematoxylin bodies or the Azzopardi phenomenon on basement membranes of blood vessels is associated with lupus lymphadenitis,19 and these findings were absent in this case. However, in a patient with markedly elevated ANA and anti- dsDNA antibody levels, the histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sys- temic lupus erythematosus.\n\nFigure 3. Lymph Node\u2013Biopsy Specimen.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining (Panel A) shows mostly preserved architecture with focal necrosis. At higher magni\u2011 fication (Panel B), there are necrotic areas with apoptotic debris and histiocytes with vacuolated cytoplasm. On immu\u2011 nostaining (Panels C and D), CD20+ B cells are appropriately concentrated in follicles (Panel C) and CD3+ T cells are present mostly outside the follicles (Panel D).\n\n",
