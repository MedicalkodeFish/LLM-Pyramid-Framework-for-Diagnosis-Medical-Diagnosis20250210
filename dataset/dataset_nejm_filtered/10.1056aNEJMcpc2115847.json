    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Cory A. Perugino: A 70-year-old man was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of a recurrent left pleural effusion.\nFive years before this presentation, the patient had pain in the shoulders and proximal muscles of the arms and legs. The pain was worse in the morning and was associated with fatigue. There was no associated stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were elevated. Prednisone was initiated for the treatment of a working diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms abated quickly. During the next year, attempts to discontinue predni- sone led to recurrent myalgias, as well as elevations in the erythrocyte sedimenta- tion rate and the C-reactive protein level.\nThree years before this presentation, swelling, erythema, and pain developed in the cartilaginous portion of the left ear, sparing the earlobe (Fig. 1). There was no reduction in these symptoms after empirical antibacterial therapy was initiated for the treatment of presumed cellulitis. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the symptoms involving the ear resolved; however, they recurred when the dose of prednisone was tapered. Biopsy of the left auricle revealed perichondrial inflam- mation and degenerative changes in the cartilage. The dose of prednisone was increased for a presumed diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis. The symptoms involving the ear resolved, and weekly therapy with methotrexate was initiated.\nDuring the next 6 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose were associ- ated with worsening inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms, along with eleva- tions in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was as high as 89 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13) and the C-reactive protein level as high as 73.6 mg per liter (reference value, <8.0).\nTwo years before this presentation, the patient began treatment with tocilizu- mab for fatigue, markedly elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythro- cyte sedimentation rate, all of which persisted despite treatment with prednisone and methotrexate. The administration of tocilizumab allowed for the tapering of prednisone to a lower dose without causing an exacerbation of inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms. Two weeks after the patient began receiving tocilizumab therapy, and upon taper- ing of the prednisone dose, pain and swelling developed in the right leg; ultrasound examina- tion revealed a distal deep-vein thrombosis in the right posterior tibial vein. Repeat ultrasonogra- phy of the leg performed 2 weeks later did not show propagation of the deep-vein thrombosis, and the pain and swelling resolved with the continued use of a compression stocking and elevation of the right leg. However, 2 months later, when further tapering of the prednisone dose was started, inflammatory joint and carti- lage symptoms recurred, and pain and swelling developed in the left leg. Ultrasound examina- tion revealed deep-vein thromboses in the left popliteal and left calf veins and in the right femoral vein; therapy with rivaroxaban was initi- ated. The development of recurrent deep-vein thromboses was attributed to the underlying inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, methotrexate was continued, and tocilizumab was replaced with infliximab therapy. During the next 6 months, the inflammatory joint and cartilage symptoms worsened when attempts were made to taper the prednisone dose, and these conditions abated only when the dose of prednisone was increased. Blood tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), rheumatoid factor, and anti\u2013cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were negative. Fifteen months before this presentation, treatment with rituxi- mab was initiated. However, after an attempt to taper the dose of prednisone, bilateral scleritis developed (Fig. 1); the dose of prednisone was increased again, which resulted in resolution of the ocular pain and redness. During the next 3 months, attempts to taper the prednisone dose resulted in recurrent episodes of scleritis and in- flammatory joint and cartilage symptoms; addi- tional rituximab treatment was not administered. One year before the current presentation, treatment with low-dose cyclophosphamide was initiated, but the use of this medication was complicated by severe neutropenia, which did not allow for the dose to be escalated. Nine months before this presentation, treatment with cyclophosphamide was stopped, and intravenous tocilizumab was restarted, given its previous effi- cacy in this patient. However, the use of tocilizu- mab also resulted in moderate but transient\nneutropenia after each infusion.\nSeven months before this presentation, pleu- ritic chest pain on the lower left side developed, along with dyspnea on exertion and a dry cough. Chest radiography revealed a moderate left pleu- ral effusion (Fig. 2A and 2B). Thoracentesis was performed, and 1 liter of straw-colored pleural fluid was removed; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Gram\u2019s staining of the pleural fluid revealed abundant polymorphonuclear cells but no organisms; bacterial, fungal, and myco- bacterial cultures were without growth. Cytologic examination of the pleural f luid revealed no malignant cells. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (performed after the pleural fluid was drained) showed a small left pleural effusion, a trace right pleural effusion, and bibasilar depen- dent atelectasis without consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2C). The pleural effu- sions were attributed to ongoing inflammatory disease. The dose of prednisone was increased, and the pleurisy and dyspnea resolved. Five months before this presentation, tocilizumab therapy was stopped, and tofacitinib was initiated. One week before this presentation, the patient had sudden onset of back pain on the left side. Imag- ing studies were performed.\nDr. Vincent V. Dinculescu: CT of the chest and abdomen, performed 6 months after the first CT of the chest, revealed a small left pleural effu- sion that was larger than it had been on the first chest CT (Fig. 2D). A punctate stone in the lower pole of the left kidney was also observed, with no evidence of hydronephrosis.\nDr. Perugino: The patient presented to the rheu- matology clinic for further evaluation. He had no dyspnea, cough, or fever. On examination, the temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the heart rate 64 beats per minute, the blood pressure 145/75 mm Hg,\nthe respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 29.2. There was no scleral redness or erythema of the helix of the ear. The heart sounds were regular. Breath sounds were decreased at the base of the left lung. There was no leg edema, joint swelling or tenderness, pur- pura, petechiae, or deficits in motor strength.\nThe patient had a history of mucinous adeno- carcinoma of the cecum, which had been diag- nosed 10 years before this presentation and had been treated with laparoscopic colectomy of the right side of the colon and with oxaliplatin therapy, without evidence of recurrence. Other history included peripheral neuropathy (attrib- uted to the oxaliplatin therapy), hypothyroidism, and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Macrocytic anemia had been pres- ent for 3 years before this presentation, with normal blood levels of cobalamin and folate. The patient also had a history of leukopenia and neutropenia; these conditions had occurred in- termittently over the course of the 10 years pre- ceding this presentation but were most pro- nounced after treatment with cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab. Medications included alendro- nate, atorvastatin, cholecalciferol, folic acid, levo- thyroxine, methotrexate, omeprazole, prednisone, rivaroxaban, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, and tofacitinib. The patient drank alcohol occasional- ly; he did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. He lived in New England and was retired. There was no family history of autoimmune disease.\nThe blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, and\nthyrotropin were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests. Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs.\nA photograph of the posterior portion of the left ear (Panel A) obtained 3 years before this presentation shows prominent auricular edema and erythema; a small portion of the ear (the noncartilaginous portion) is un\u2011 affected. These findings are consistent with chondritis. The unaffected right ear (Panel B) is shown as a refer\u2011 ence to highlight the degree of inflammation involving the contralateral auricle at the time of onset of chon\u2011 dritis. A photograph of the left eye (Panel C) obtained 15 months before this presentation shows ocular injec\u2011 tion (i.e., redness), which was more prominent in the left eye than in the right eye, with sparing of the lim\u2011 bus \u2014 a finding that is consistent with scleritis. This sign was associated with ocular pain and reduced visual acuity.\n\nFigure 2. Imaging Studies of the Chest.\nPosteroanterior (Panel A) and lateral (Panel B) chest radiographs obtained 7 months before this presentation show a moderate left pleural effusion (arrows). A contrast\u2011enhanced axial CT image through the thorax (Panel C), obtained after thoracentesis, shows a small left pleural effusion and a trace right pleural effusion (arrows) with bibasilar atelec\u2011 tasis but no consolidation, nodules, or lymphadenopathy. Six months later, an axial CT image through the thorax (Panel D), obtained without intravenous contrast enhancement, shows a small left pleural effusion (arrows) that is larger than it was on the previous CT image.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Peter C. Grayson: This 70-year-old man pre- sented with a recurrent left pleural effusion in the context of a severe, systemic illness that was characterized by musculoskeletal pain, chondri- tis, recurrent deep-vein thrombosis, scleritis, and elevated levels of acute-phase reactants. His pre- sentation was notable for a series of seemingly unrelated and progressive inflammatory symp- toms that were refractory to treatment with medications other than glucocorticoids.\n\nPolymyalgia Rheumatica\nThis patient\u2019s initial symptoms of pain in the shoulders and hip girdle were diagnosed as poly- myalgia rheumatica. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a misnomer, since this condition does not primar- ily involve muscle or cause weakness. Specifical- ly, symptoms of pain or stiffness associated with polymyalgia rheumatica are caused by interspi- nous, subacromial, and trochanteric bursitis. The symptoms are extremely responsive to treatment\n \nwith low-to-moderate doses of glucocorticoids; however, gradual reduction of treatment over a period of many months is usually necessary be- fore symptoms fully resolve. In suspected cases, it is important to maintain a high index of sus- picion for concurrent diseases. In approximate- ly 10 to 20% of patients who have polymyalgia rheumatica, giant-cell arteritis can develop.1 This patient had no symptoms or vascular abnor- malities that were suggestive of a concomitant large-vessel vasculitis. Polymyalgia rheumatica can be a harbinger of rheumatoid arthritis; how- ever, this patient had no features of peripheral arthritis. Musculoskeletal symptoms within the spectrum of polymyalgia rheumatica have been reported in association with various cancers, particularly hematologic neoplasms.\n\nAuricular Chondritis\nThis patient had clinical features of auricular chondritis, including cartilaginous inflamma- tion in the external ear, sparing the noncartilaginous earlobe. Symptoms of chondritis are not commonly associated with polymyalgia rheu- matica. The differential diagnosis for systemic diseases that are manifested by symptoms of auricular chondritis is limited. Relapsing poly- chondritis is an inflammatory disease character- ized in part by cartilaginous inflammation of the ear, nose, airway, and joints.2 Chondritis of the nose and airway can be subtle and over- looked. It is important to obtain additional in- formation from the patient, including whether he had nasal pain, difficulty breathing, cough, neck tenderness, or chest-wall pain. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with chon- dritis of the airway, the presence of symptoms involving the airway warrants further evaluation for subglottic stenosis and tracheobronchomala- cia by direct visualization of the airway or non- invasive imaging.\nCartilaginous inflammation of the ear, nose, and airway is also a feature of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The clinical features of GPA overlap with those of relapsing polychon- dritis. The absence of detectable ANCAs and of kidney involvement in this patient is more con- sistent with relapsing polychondritis than with GPA. This patient subsequently had scleritis, which is a feature of both GPA and relapsing polychondritis. Although infections (including mycobacterial infections) also cause chondritis of the ear in rare instances, they are unlikely to be the cause of this patient\u2019s presentation be- cause of the chronic, relapsing nature of the ear pain, with a reduction in symptoms noted in response to glucocorticoid therapy.\nRecurrent Thromboembolic Disease\nAnother notable feature of this patient\u2019s history is the development of deep-vein thrombosis. Re- current deep-vein thrombosis raises the possi- bility of an underlying hypercoagulable disease or occult cancer, especially given the history of gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. Thromboem- bolic disease occurs in association with a broad spectrum of systemic inflammatory diseases, including many forms of vasculitis.3\n\nExudative Pleural Effusion\nSeven months before this patient\u2019s current pre- sentation, he had a left pleural effusion. Analysis of the pleural fluid revealed a sterile, exudative effusion without cytologic evidence of cancer. Exudative pleural effusions are associated with certain rheumatologic diseases. Serositis is com- mon in patients with systemic lupus erythema- tosus; however, this diagnosis can essentially be ruled out in this case, given the patient\u2019s unde- tectable levels of antinuclear antibodies and ab- sence of other supporting features. Pleural effu- sions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are\n \ncharacteristically associated with a low pH and low glucose level in pleural fluid4; we are not given the pH of this patient\u2019s pleural fluid, but the level of glucose was not low. Exudative effu- sions occur rarely in patients with GPA but are not a feature of relapsing polychondritis. It is important to consider autoinf lammatory dis- eases, such as familial Mediterranean fever and tumor necrosis factor receptor\u2013associated peri- odic syndrome, in cases of recurrent serositis with systemic inflammation and musculoskele- tal pain. The development of an exudative pleu- ral effusion later in the disease course expands, rather than narrows, the differential diagnosis in this case.\n\nHematologic Abnormalities\nThis patient had laboratory abnormalities that were consistent with macrocytic anemia, neutro- penia, and a monoclonal gammopathy. Anemia of chronic disease, which is commonly associ- ated with systemic inflammatory diseases, is char- acterized by normocytic or microcytic anemia. Macrocytic anemia is exceedingly uncommon in most rheumatologic diseases, unless it is caused by toxic effects of medication. After common causes of macrocytic anemia have been ruled out, this finding may signify a bone marrow disease such as a myelodysplastic syndrome. Concomitant myelodysplastic syndromes have been reported in association with a spectrum of inflammatory diseases, including relapsing poly- chondritis among older men.5,6 Toxic effects re- sulting from medication use are the most com- mon cause of neutropenia in patients with rheumatologic diseases; however, neutropenia may be a feature of systemic lupus erythemato- sus or Felty\u2019s syndrome. Finally, monoclonal gammopathy suggests the possibility of multiple myeloma, a condition that can occur simultane- ously with polymyalgia rheumatica.\nVEXAS Syndrome\nIn late 2020, a new disease entity that was re- ferred to as VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinf lammatory, somatic) syndrome was re- ported.7 VEXAS syndrome is caused by somatic mutations in UBA1 (the gene that encodes ubiqui- tin-like modifier activating enzyme 1), which initiates the first step of cellular ubiquitylation. The mutations arise later in life and are con- fined to hematopoietic precursor cells in bone marrow and myeloid cells (e.g., neutrophils and monocytes) in peripheral blood. Since UBA1 is an X-linked gene and women are protected by a second allele, VEXAS syndrome occurs almost exclusively in men. The majority of disease- defining mutations are missense mutations in codon 41 in UBA1, which impairs translation and function of the cytoplasmic isoform of the UBA1 enzyme.\nPatients with VEXAS syndrome can have in- f lammatory symptoms that mimic rheumato- logic diseases.8 Specifically, patients with VEXAS syndrome can meet diagnostic or classification criteria for one or more diseases, including re- lapsing polychondritis, polyarteritis nodosa, giant- cell arteritis, Sweet\u2019s syndrome, ANCA-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and adult-onset Still\u2019s disease.7,9,10 This patient had several clinical features that were consistent with VEXAS syndrome. Chondritis is a common clini- cal feature in patients with VEXAS syndrome, is typically confined to the ear or nose, and can be transient and subtle without resultant damage.7 Fever and cutaneous manifestations that reflect neutrophilic dermatosis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, or medium-vessel vasculitis are common in patients with VEXAS syndrome but were not present in this case.7 Pulmonary involvement can occur, often in the later stages of disease. Sterile neutrophilic alveolitis is the most common pul- monary manifestation, but exudative pleural ef- fusions have been reported in a minority of pa- tients. Musculoskeletal conditions that can mimic polymyalgia rheumatica have been described. Re- current thromboembolic disease, in the absence of traditional risk factors for hypercoagulability, is common in patients with VEXAS syndrome. Inflammation can be severe and difficult to treat, and only glucocorticoids have shown con- sistent effectiveness in ameliorating symptoms.7,11 In addition to systemic inflammatory disease, progressive bone marrow failure is a defining feature of VEXAS syndrome. Mutations in UBA1 in bone marrow stem cells and in hematopoietic progenitor cells, with subsequent clonal expan- sion, result in hematologic abnormalities. Macro- cytosis is the most common hematologic mani- festation and is typically an early feature of disease. Progressive cytopenias, especially thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, occur in the later phases of disease.12 Bone marrow biopsies that are performed in patients with VEXAS syndrome typically reveal hypercellular marrow with my- eloid predominance. Numerous cytoplasmic vacu- oles in erythroid and myeloid precursor cells are present in the bone marrow aspirate in almost all patients with VEXAS syndrome.8 Monoclonal gammopathy has been reported in approximate- ly 20% of patients.7 Serial bone marrow biopsies may reveal progression to myelodysplastic syn- drome or to multiple myeloma.12\nA simple clinical algorithm to identify pa- tients with VEXAS syndrome with near-perfect accuracy has been proposed.13 Men with chon- dritis of the ear or nose are likely to have VEXAS syndrome if the mean corpuscular volume is greater than 100 f l or if the platelet count is greater than 200,000 per microliter. When the algorithm is applied to this patient, the findings suggest that genetic testing will confirm a diag- nosis of VEXAS syndrome. A bone marrow biopsy should be performed to rule out hematologic cancer; however, genetic testing for VEXAS syn- drome may be performed on either bone marrow or peripheral-blood cells, since mutational bur- den is typically high in both compartments.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Judith A. Ferry: The diagnostic procedure was a bone marrow biopsy. The core-biopsy specimen was hypercellular for the patient\u2019s age. The mar- row specimen showed maturing trilineage hema- topoiesis with an increased myeloid-to-erythroid ratio. The aspirate smear showed complete matu- ration of myeloid and erythroid elements. Multi- ple cytoplasmic vacuoles were present, mainly in early myeloid elements (including promyelocytes, occasional myelocytes, and rare blasts) and in- frequently in early erythroid precursors (Fig. 3). Vacuoles were not conspicuous in more mature myeloid or erythroid elements or in lymphoid cells. On iron staining, an aspirate smear showed decreased iron stores and no ring sideroblasts.\nFlow cytometry revealed 5% T cells (with no\nimmunophenotypic abnormalities and a normal ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells), less  than 1%\n \nnatural killer cells, no detectable B cells, and no increase in myeloid blasts. Next-generation se- quencing revealed single-nucleotide variants in DNMT3A and TET2; in the absence of morpho- logic evidence of dysplasia, these variants were interpreted as clonal hematopoiesis of indeter- minate potential. Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY).\nIn addition, peripheral blood was submitted to the National Human Genome Research Insti- tute of the National Institutes of Health. A single variant (c.122T\u2192G; p.Met41Thr) was identified in the UBA1 gene by means of Sanger sequencing. In conjunction with the clinical and pathologi- cal findings in this case, this genetic abnor- mality confirms a diagnosis of VEXAS syndrome. The p.Met41Thr variant is the most common mutation that causes VEXAS syndrome.7,8 The presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles, as seen in this case, is not a specific finding; they can also be seen in marrow elements in association with zinc toxicity, copper deficiency, alcohol use, and myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as in certain types of neoplastic cells. However, the mutation in UBA1 indicates that the vacuoles are related to VEXAS syndrome and not to some other cause.\n",
