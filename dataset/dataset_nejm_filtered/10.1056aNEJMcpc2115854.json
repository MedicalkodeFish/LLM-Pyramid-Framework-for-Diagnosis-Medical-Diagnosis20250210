    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Annabelle Anandappa (Medicine): A 25-year-old man with a history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospi- tal because of vision changes.\nTen months before this presentation, the patient was evaluated for fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 3.5 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5) and a white-cell count of 23,450 per micro- liter (reference range, 4000 to 11,000), with 81% lymphocytes and 4% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was performed.\nDr. Judith A. Ferry: Examination of the bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen (Fig. 1) revealed markedly hypercellular marrow with a loss of normal elements. There were sheets of blasts, including larger cells with oval-to-irregular nuclei, fine chro- matin, distinct nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm, as well as more mature-appearing lymphocyte-like blasts with more condensed chromatin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed  an  abnormal  karyotype:  46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[15]/46,idem,t(2;12) (p13;p13),?del(10)(p13)[3]/46,idem,del(6)(p21),add(7)(p13)[2].  On  next-generation sequencing, SNaPshot analysis identified a RUNX1 mutation, and gene fusion analysis was positive for BCR-ABL1 e13a2. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with BCR-ABL1 was made.\nDr. Anandappa: Induction chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, metho- trexate, cytarabine, and prednisone was administered, along with dasatinib and intrathecal cytarabine, methotrexate, and hydrocortisone. One month later, exami- nation of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed 7% blasts. Treatment with blinatumomab was started, and dasatinib was continued.\nSeven months before this presentation, examination of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen revealed a complete hematologic response. BCR-ABL1 was undetectable by means of reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction testing.\nFive months before this presentation, the patient underwent allogeneic hemato- poietic-cell transplantation (HCT) from a matched, unrelated donor after myeloab- lative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Early post- transplantation complications included severe mucositis and febrile neutropenia.\nTwo months before this presentation, exami- nation of a bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen re- vealed a complete hematologic response, no BCR-ABL1 rearrangement, and full donor chime- rism. Dasatinib was continued as maintenance therapy. During the next 2 months, the patient had worsening anemia, and dasatinib was stopped. Two days before this presentation, the patient noticed \u201clarge black blobs\u201d that looked like shadows in the periphery of the visual fields of both eyes. There were also intermittent episodes of blurry vision in both eyes that resolved after 10 minutes. Two days later, the patient sought an evaluation in the oncology clinic of this hos- pital and was transferred to the emergency de-\npartment for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient re- ported ongoing vision symptoms but no eye pain, f lashing lights, or f loaters. He also reported 3 weeks of night sweats, areas of swelling in the neck and groin, and a pruritic rash on the upper chest, upper back, and both arms. He had a his- tory of chronic daily migraine headaches, which had frequently been associated with eye pain and photophobia but had not been associated with vision changes. Other medical history included depression and obesity. Medications included tacrolimus, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, fam- ciclovir, omeprazole, and escitalopram, as well as vitamin D and magnesium supplementation. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived in a coastal town in New England with his mother. He had previously worked in the food- service industry. He had never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs; he drank three cans of beer weekly. His family history included breast cancer and headaches in his maternal grandmother, prostate cancer in his paternal grandfather, and hypertension in his father.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C,\nthe blood pressure 136/88 mm Hg, the pulse 104 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Visual acuity was 20/25 in both eyes with correc- tion, and visual fields were full on confrontation testing. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light. There was no proptosis. Slit-lamp exami- nation revealed few cells in the anterior cham- ber, and funduscopic examination was normal. Test results for cranial nerve function, strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and gait were normal. There was palpable lymphadenopathy in the cervical, clavicular, axillary, and inguinal regions. Discrete papules were present on both arms, and diffuse xerosis and an eczematous rash were present on the upper back and chest. Laboratory testing revealed a platelet count of 47,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). Blood testing for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), varicella\u2013zoster virus, and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) DNA was negative. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and Lyme disease was also nega- tive. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear confirmed the presence of anemia and thrombo- cytopenia; there were no schistocytes. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nImaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Karen Rodriguez: Magnetic resonance imag- ing (MRI) of the head was performed. T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (Fig. 2A and 2B) showed multiple new hyperintense lesions, measuring up to 11 mm in greatest dimension, within the supratentorial and infratentorial re- gions of the brain. Images obtained after the administration of contrast material showed faint enhancement of the lesions. These foci appeared to be centered within the juxtacortical and peri- ventricular white matter and could reflect areas of demyelination, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving the central nervous system (CNS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involve- ment, or an infectious process. There was no abnormal enhancement of the optic nerves or the orbital structures.\n18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)\u2013positron-emis-\nsion tomography (PET) and computed tomogra- phy (CT) was also performed. The PET-CT scans (Fig. 2C through 2H) showed moderate-to- intense FDG uptake associated with widespread lymphadenopathy, including bilateral cervical, ax- illary, external iliac, and inguinal lymph nodes. There was also abnormal uptake in the spleen.\nDr. Anandappa: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and lumbar puncture was per- formed. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a total protein level of 147 mg per deciliter (refer- ence range, 5 to 55) and a glucose level of 49 mg per deciliter (2.7 mmol per liter; reference range, 50 to 75 mg per deciliter [2.8 to 4.2 mmol per liter]). The white-cell count was 21 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with 61% lymphocytes, 27% neutrophils, and 3% eosinophils; the red- cell count was 16,000 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5), with xanthochromia present. Gram\u2019s staining of cerebrospinal fluid showed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells and no organisms. Cytologic studies were notable for increased lymphocytes and plasma cells. \n\nFigure 1. Initial Bone Marrow\u2013Biopsy Specimen.\nAn initial bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen was obtained 10 months before this presentation. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the specimen (Panel A) shows mark\u2011 edly hypercellular marrow. At higher magnification (Panel B), there are larger blasts with fine chromatin (top half) and smaller blasts with more condensed chromatin (bottom half).\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Zachariah DeFilipp: I participated in the care of this patient, and I am aware of the final diagno- sis. This 25-year-old man with a history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented 5 months after allogeneic HCT with vision changes, lymph- adenopathy, worsening anemia, thrombocytope- nia, and monoclonal protein detected on serum protein electrophoresis. MRI of the head showed multiple lesions in the periventricular white matter. In developing a differential diagnosis, I will consider diseases that would be likely to occur in this patient, given his history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and subsequent alloge- neic HCT.\n\nRelapse of Acute Leukemia\nAlthough outcomes of transplantation in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have improved substantially in recent decades,1 the leading cause of unsuccessful HCT remains dis- ease relapse (cumulative incidence, 30 to 40%).2 Disease relapse can occur at any time but is most likely to occur within the first year after HCT. This patient presented 5 months after transplan- tation with worsening anemia, thrombocytope- nia, lymphadenopathy, and CNS lesions. These features could be attributed to relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with bone marrow in- volvement and extramedullary manifestations, but this is uncommon. In general, disease re- lapse with CNS involvement occurs infrequently after allogeneic HCT (cumulative incidence, 2 to 3%) and is more likely to occur in patients with previous CNS involvement,3 which had not been present in this patient. Nevertheless, disease re- lapse remains a possibility, and bone marrow biopsy would be performed to evaluate for evi- dence of relapse if there was no alternative ex- planation for his presentation.\nInfection\nAn opportunistic infection involving the CNS is an important consideration in a patient present- ing with acute vision changes within the first year after allogeneic HCT. Recipients of alloge- neic HCT remain immunocompromised after transplantation until recovery of the donor- derived immune system. The degree and length of immunosuppression vary and can be influ- enced by characteristics such as the donor source and the use of an immunosuppressive regimen, as well as the development and treatment of chronic GVHD.4\nFive months after transplantation, this pa- tient was still being treated with tacrolimus and was at risk for infectious complications, despite the administration of trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethox- azole and famciclovir prophylaxis. Several infec- tions can cause mass lesions in the brain, including fungal, bacterial, and protozoan infections.5 This patient was at risk for infection with a fungus or mold during the periods of prolonged neutropenia that occurred while he was receiv- ing treatment for leukemia before transplanta- tion. Ongoing immunosuppression could allow for the development of fulminant clinical dis- ease, despite neutrophil recovery. In addition, the lack of immune reconstitution could contrib- ute to the reactivation of a previous Toxoplasma gondii infection. However, these pathogens would be unlikely to explain the widespread lymphade- nopathy observed on PET-CT, as well as the ane- mia, thrombocytopenia, and monoclonal protein.\n\nMedication\nCould any of this patient\u2019s medications account for his current presentation? He was taking tacro- limus, which has been associated with throm- botic microangiopathy6 and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.7 Transplantation-asso- ciated thrombotic microangiopathy should be considered because the patient had new throm- bocytopenia; this disorder is often overlooked, since its clinical features mimic those of other disorders that occur after transplantation. How- ever, the absence of schistocytes on the periph- eral-blood smear makes transplantation-associ- ated thrombotic microangiopathy unlikely. In addition, this diagnosis would not account for the lymphadenopathy or CNS lesions. Patients with posterior reversible encephalopathy syn- drome can present with headache, seizures, al- tered mental status, and vision loss, along with associated changes on imaging. However, the MRI findings in this patient were not consistent with this diagnosis. Furthermore, complications from tacrolimus would not explain the wide- spread lymphadenopathy.\nGraft-versus-Host Disease\nGVHD is one of the more common immuno- logic complications that occur after allogeneic HCT. Acute GVHD typically occurs early after transplantation and mainly affects the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.8 Chronic GVHD clas- sically occurs later in the transplantation course and can manifest as inflammatory or fibrot- ic changes in a wide array of target organs.9 At 5 months after transplantation, it would be pos- sible for late acute GVHD, classic chronic GVHD, or an overlap subtype with both acute and chronic features to develop. GVHD can cause thrombocytopenia10 but is not commonly associ- ated with lymphadenopathy or CNS disease. In addition, this patient had a rash but had no other typical symptoms of GVHD, such as dry eyes or mouth, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, or joint tightness.\n\nSecondary Cancer\nThe imaging findings in this patient, including the lymphadenopathy and CNS lesions, could represent a secondary cancer, such as solid or extramedullary treatment-related myeloid disease. These cancers can occur after transplantation, especially when the transplantation is performed with total-body irradiation.11 However, they are rare, particularly within the first year.\nPost-Transplantation Lymphoproliferative Disorder\nPost-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare complication after allogeneic HCT (127 cases in 26,901 transplant recipients)12; it is more likely to occur after solid-organ trans- plantation.13 PTLD represents a spectrum of clinical and morphologic lymphoproliferative states, ranging from benign reactive polyclonal hyperplasia to lymphoma. Most cases of PTLD after HCT are associated with an EBV infection of donor origin and occur within the first year after transplantation.14 In the context of im- paired T-cell\u2013mediated immunity, previously la- tent EBV-infected cells can proliferate and con- tribute to the pathogenesis of PTLD. Patients with PTLD often present with fever, lymphade- nopathy, and organ-specific manifestations. CNS disease is rare. Risk factors include the use of ex vivo T-cell depletion, the presence of anti\u2013T-cell antibodies, the use of umbilical cord blood as the graft source, and the presence of HLA mis- match, none of which were factors in this patient. When patients with PTLD have a negative test for EBV, the next most common viral cause, HHV-8, is considered.15 This patient had nega- tive blood tests for both EBV and HHV-8 DNA. However, his diffuse lymphadenopathy was most consistent with a diagnosis of PTLD, so other causes of PTLD were considered. Notable labora- tory findings on presentation included elevated blood levels of globulin and IgG; these findings prompted serum protein electrophoresis, which showed monoclonal protein (IgG kappa M component at a level of 5.18 g per deciliter in the gamma region). This finding was quite unex pected and, in the context of the PET-CT find- ings, was suggestive of PTLD related to plasma- cell myeloma or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma with associated monoclonal protein. Given the pos- sible diagnosis of PTLD, we elected to proceed with biopsy of a lymph node in the inguinal re- gion, which was the most easily accessible area with lymphadenopathy.",
