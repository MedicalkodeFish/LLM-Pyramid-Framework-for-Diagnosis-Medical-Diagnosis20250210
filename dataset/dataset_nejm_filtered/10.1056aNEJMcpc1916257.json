    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Kristin M. D\u2019Silva (Medicine): A 55-year-old man was transferred to this hospital from a rehabilitation facility because of abdominal pain and painful skin lesions. One year before the current presentation, the patient received a diagnosis of pancreatitis at another hospital after magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogra- phy (MRCP) performed for the evaluation of chronic abdominal pain revealed pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic fat stranding involving the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Blood levels of triglycerides and IgG subclasses were report- edly normal, and the patient had not been drinking alcohol; the pancreatitis was attributed to bevacizumab, which had been administered for the treatment of neurofibromatosis. Bevacizumab therapy was stopped for 2 months. After bevaciz- umab therapy was restarted, elevated blood lipase levels recurred without any ab-\ndominal symptoms, and bevacizumab therapy was discontinued.\nSeven months before the current presentation, another MRCP showed pancre- atic ductal dilatation and a pancreatic pseudocyst with internal calcification. Endo- scopic ultrasonography revealed changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis and a pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient was advised to continue to avoid alcohol and fatty foods. Blood lipase levels returned to normal.\nThree and half months before the current presentation, pain in the ankles de- veloped. The patient reported that the pain was worse after prolonged rest and that his ankles felt stiff for 1 hour after he awoke in the morning. Two weeks later, pain, redness, and swelling in the left lower leg developed, with a central fluctuant nodule on an erythematous base (Fig. 1A). Over the next 2 weeks, swelling and redness of the left fifth toe and the right first metacarpophalangeal joint devel- oped (Fig. 1B and 1C). The patient was evaluated by his primary care physician. Range of motion was limited in the ankles, which had overlying soft-tissue swelling and tenderness on palpation. There was also erythema, tenderness, and soft-tissue swelling of the right fourth metacarpophalangeal joint, the left second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, and the right fourth proximal interpha- langeal joint of the hand. The erythrocyte sedi- mentation rate was 76 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 15), and the C-reactive protein level was 102 mg per liter (reference range, 0 to 8). Blood levels of calcium, uric acid, angiotensin- converting enzyme, rheumatoid factor, cyclic citrullinated peptide, streptolysin, and DNase were normal; tests for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A chest radiograph was normal. Empiri- cal treatment with cephalexin was administered. After several days, the patient\u2019s condition had not improved, and he was evaluated by a rheu- matologist. He received a diagnosis of possible L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome, and prednisone was pre- scribed. Over the next 2 weeks, there was a de- crease in the swelling and pain in the left fifth toe and right first metacarpophalangeal joint but not in the ankle pain or the skin lesion in the left leg. Pain in the ankles worsened, was minimally alleviated with the administration of oxycodone, and limited the patient\u2019s ability to walk. The dose of prednisone was increased, and colchicine was administered, with a decrease in the ankle pain and resolution of the skin lesion in the left leg.\nFive weeks before the current presentation, the patient was admitted to a second hospital with septic and hemorrhagic shock in the con- text of infected pancreatic necrosis and bleeding from a gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm. Dr. Lauren A. Roller: Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple peripancreatic fluid collections and ir- regularity of the branch vessels of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries, including the gas- troduodenal artery, adjacent to areas of pancre- atic necrosis and inflammation (Fig. 2A and 2B). Dr. D\u2019Silva: Percutaneous drainage of the pan- creatic necrosis and angioembolization of the gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm were performed. On the fourth hospital day, the pa- tient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nAt this hospital, five intraabdominal drainage catheters were placed, with a decrease in the size of the multifocal fluid collections in the abdo- men. Cultures of intraabdominal f luid grew Pantoea agglomerans (formerly Enterobacter agglom- erans), abiotrophia species (formerly nutritionally variant streptococci), and lactobacillus species. The patient completed a course of piperacillin in combination with tazobactam and was dis- charged from this hospital to a rehabilitation facility on the 24th hospital day.\nSeven days after discharge, periumbilical and right lower abdominal pain developed, and the patient returned to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation. There was no fe- ver, nausea, vomiting, or joint pain. He reported 5 days of painful skin lesions and swelling of the right leg.\nOther medical history included hypertension, neurofibromatosis type 2, gastroesophageal re- flux disease, sensorineural hearing loss, benign prostatic hypertrophy, and anxiety. There was no history of sinusitis, inflammatory eye disease, neuropathy, or testicular disease. Neurofibroma- tosis had been complicated by cervical spine ependymoma, meningiomas, and vestibular schwannomas and had been treated with bevaciz- umab for 8 months before the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Medications included aspirin, gabapentin, hydrochlorothiazide, lorazepam, losartan, meto- prolol, omeprazole, oxycodone, pancrelipase, prednisone, tamsulosin, and tolterodine. There was a history of heavy alcohol use, but the patient had stopped drinking alcohol 3 years before this presentation. There was a remote history of to- bacco use and no history of illicit drug use. He lived with his mother in a suburb of Boston.\nThe temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the blood pres- sure  107/68  mm  Hg,  the  pulse  118  beats  per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The weight was 73.6 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 22. The abdomen was soft and nontender, with five percutaneous drainage catheters in place. There was pitting edema in the right foot. A blanching, erythematous, indu- rated plaque (5 cm in diameter) with superficial scale was present on the medial aspect of the right knee (Fig. 1D); a similar lesion (1 cm in diameter) was present on the superior aspect of the right knee. There were two blanching, erythematous, thin plaques (1 cm in diameter) on the left lateral calf (Fig. 1E). There were several nontender, hyperpigmented patches on the low- er legs that were consistent with postinflamma- tory hyperpigmentation. There was pain on pal- pation and diffuse erythema and warmth of the right lower calf. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nBlood levels of electrolytes and glucose were\nnormal, as were results of kidney- and liver- function tests. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Roller: CT of the abdomen and pelvis, per- formed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a slight decrease in the size of multiple necrotic peripancreatic fluid collections, with drainage catheters in place (Fig. 2C). There was evidence of previous embo- lization of the gastroduodenal artery without evidence of residual or new pseudoaneurysm. Duplex ultrasonography of the right leg showed nonocclusive thrombosis in the distal right femo- ral vein.\nDr. D\u2019Silva: A specimen of fluid from the larg- est abdominal collection and a specimen of blood were obtained for culture; ceftriaxone was ad- ministered. A diagnostic test was performed.\n\nFigure 1. Clinical Photographs.\nThree months before the current presentation, the patient presented with erythema and swelling in the left lower leg, with a central fluctuant nodule on an erythematous base (Panel A). Ten weeks before the current presentation, erythema and swelling of the left fifth toe (Panel B) and right first metacarpophalangeal joint (Panel C) developed. During the current evaluation, blanching, erythematous, indurated plaques on the medial aspect of the right knee (Panel D) and the lateral left calf (Panel E) were seen.\n\nFigure 2.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Mariko R. Yasuda: This 55-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis complicated by infected pan- creatic necrosis presented with skin lesions at two discrete time points. The first skin lesion, which occurred 3 months before the current admission, was a fluctuant nodule on an ery- thematous base on the distal leg that developed in the context of ankle and metacarpal pain. The lesions that were present on the current admis- sion were different, consisting of blanching, ery- thematous, indurated plaques with superficial scale on the knee, with blanching, erythema- tous, thin plaques on the calf and several hyper- pigmented patches on the lower legs.\nAlthough these lesions have different morphologic features, the fact that the second le- sions occurred within 3 months after the first lesion suggests that they are part of the same cutaneous process but are in different stages of evolution \u2014 the fluctuant nodule on a red base represents the acute phase and the plaques with fine scale and hyperpigmented patches represent a chronic or resolving process. I will therefore focus my differential diagnosis on causes of red nodules on the legs, including vasculitis, cancer, infection, and panniculitis.\n\nVasculitis\nCould this patient have cutaneous vasculitis? Vasculitis involving small or medium-sized ves- sels can have dermatologic manifestations.1 Typ- ically, the size of the skin lesion correlates with the size of the involved vessel.2 Small-vessel vasculitis, such as Henoch\u2013Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, typically manifests as crops of small, palpable purpura.1 The size of this patient\u2019s lesions is more consistent with medium-vessel vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa. However, if this patient were to have medium-vessel vasculitis, I would expect to see punched-out ulcers or le- sions that are consistent with livedo reticularis.1 In addition, this patient\u2019s normal renal function, normal chest radiograph, and negative test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies make vas- culitis unlikely.\n\nCancer\nCancer can mimic inflammatory skin disorders. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma is a rare primary cutaneous lymphoma of mature cytotoxic T cells, and the disease typically follows an indolent course. Lesions are usually single or multiple nodules and plaques on the legs. How- ever, the disease most commonly occurs in middle- aged women with coexisting conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclero- sis, or hypothyroidism.3 Furthermore, the nod- ules are usually painless. Thus, the diagnosis is unlikely in this case.\nPrimary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma often causes necrotizing plaques and tumors or red, scaly plaques that mimic mycosis fungoides. However, patients with primary cuta- neous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma typically have a more aggressive course than that seen in this patient, and I would not expect the skin le- sions to resolve spontaneously.4-6\n\nInfection\nCould this patient have cellulitis? Patients with cellulitis typically have acute, unilateral, diffuse, poorly demarcated, tender erythema.7 This pa- tient had bilateral, tender nodules that persisted even after he received a course of cephalexin early in the disease process, as well as ceftriax- one later during his illness; thus, uncomplicated cellulitis is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.\nFungal infections are an important consider- ation in this patient, who was immunocompro- mised owing to chronic poor health and predni- sone use. Invasive candidiasis is the leading cause of mycosis-associated death in the United States.8 This patient\u2019s risk factors for invasive candidiasis include intraperitoneal drainage catheters, gastrointestinal infection, and recent bevacizumab use. However, typical dermatologic manifestations of invasive candidiasis are ec- thyma gangrenosum\u2013like lesions, oral thrush, and a folliculitis-like eruption. In addition, cul- tures of intraabdominal fluid obtained from this patient did not grow any candida species. Over- all, systemic candidiasis is unlikely.\nThe risk of primary cutaneous aspergillosis\nincreases with prednisone use and can occur at venipuncture sites,8 but this patient did not have a history of venipuncture at the lesion sites or of local trauma. Cutaneous manifestations of sys- temic aspergillosis vary and can include subcu- taneous nodules, necrotic papulonodules, pur- puric nodules, and eschars.8 Mucormycosis has a predilection for the arms and legs and for sites of local trauma. Cutaneous manifestations of systemic mucormycosis also vary and can in- clude papules, pustules, vesicles, and hemor- rhagic bullae.8 If this patient\u2019s skin lesions were due to aspergillosis or mucormycosis, I would expect the number of lesions to increase quickly and the disease to spread rapidly in the context of ongoing prednisone use. Because of the vari- able cutaneous manifestations and high mortal- ity associated with angioinvasive fungi, I would maintain a high degree of suspicion until a biopsy of the skin or other affected tissue was per- formed and histopathological and microbiologic evaluation could reliably rule out aspergillosis and mucormycosis.\nPanniculitis\nWhen this patient initially presented with cuta- neous lesions and joint pain, prednisone therapy was started for possible L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome. L\u00f6fgren\u2019s syndrome is characterized by a classic triad of erythema nodosum, hilar lymphadenopa thy, and acute polyarthritis, although diagnosis of this condition does not require all three clini- cal findings.9 This patient had a normal chest radiograph, without evidence of hilar lymphade- nopathy. Moreover, his initial lesion, a fluctuant nodule on a red base, was not consistent with classic erythema nodosum, a panniculitis that typically manifests as multiple symmetric, tender subcutaneous nodules without bullae or ulcer- ation.9\nCould this patient, with elevated levels of in- flammatory markers and joint pain, have lupus panniculitis? Lupus panniculitis often precedes chronic cutaneous (discoid) lupus or systemic lupus.10 However, lupus panniculitis is most common in women and is characterized by ten- der subcutaneous nodules and plaques on the face, proximal arms, and trunk but not on the legs.10 This patient\u2019s skin lesions were confined to the legs, which makes lupus panniculitis unlikely.\nAnother cause of panniculitis to consider in this patient is pancreatic panniculitis. Patients with pancreatic panniculitis have tender, some- times fluctuant subcutaneous nodules that com- monly involve the legs. The nodules can ulcerate, releasing oily, thick, yellowish-brown material indicative of necrotic adipose tissue.11 Other fea- tures that can be observed in patients with pan- creatic panniculitis include pancreatic pseudo- cysts and polyarthritis, both of which are features of this patient\u2019s presentation.10 Exami- nation of a skin-biopsy specimen would reveal fat saponification by calcium salts, with homo- geneous basophilic material or \u201cghost cells\u201d \u2014 a histologic feature that distinguishes pancreatic panniculitis from other panniculitides.10 Treat- ment of the underlying pancreatic disease can result in resolution of cutaneous lesions.\nI think the most likely diagnosis in this patient is pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome. This rare syndrome, which is described mainly in case reports, is thought to be due to elevated pancreatic enzymes in the blood that lead to fat necrosis particularly affecting the subcutaneous adipose tissue, joints, and bones.10,12 It is most common in middle-aged men with alcohol use disorder.12 Patients with this syn- drome have the cutaneous clinical and histo- pathological features of pancreatic panniculitis. To establish the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis, and specifically of pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome, I would perform a skin biopsy.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Mai P. Hoang: A punch biopsy of the skin on the medial aspect of the right knee was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed lobular panniculitis with marked fat necrosis and saponification (Fig. 3A). Anucleate and necrotic adipocytes with basophilic cyto- plasm, which are features of coagulative fat ne- crosis, were seen (Fig. 3B). These findings are most consistent with pancreatic panniculitis.\nIn patients with pancreatic panniculitis, the necrotizing inflammation in the subcutaneous fat is probably a result of adipocyte necrosis due to systemic release of pancreatic enzymes (lipase, amylase, phosphorylase, and trypsin) and subse- quent neutrophilic infiltration. Dystrophic calci- fication may be present. Chronic changes can include granulomatous inflammation and hemo- siderin deposition. Fibrosis and lipoatrophy can occur late in the disease process.11",
