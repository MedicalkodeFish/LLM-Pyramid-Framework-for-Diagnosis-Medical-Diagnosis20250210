    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Christian C. Mewaldt (Medicine): An 83-year-old man was transferred to this hos- pital because of pancytopenia and acute renal failure.\nFive days before this presentation, the patient was found conscious on his bed- room floor; he had been well the previous evening. A caregiver noticed that the patient had new generalized weakness and unsteadiness and was unable to walk with a walker. He was taken to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.\nThe temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, the pulse 103 beats per minute, the blood pressure 165/55 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen satura- tion 95% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and oriented to self and date of birth. The cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal examinations were normal. The creatinine level was 3.2 mg per deciliter (283 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.7 to 1.2 mg per deciliter [62 to 106 \u03bcmol per liter]), increased from his baseline level of 2.4 mg per deciliter (212 \u03bcmol per liter). Other labora- tory test results are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph showed mild pulmonary congestion. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a right parietal ventriculo- peritoneal shunt terminating in the left lateral ventricle that had been placed 2 years earlier because of normal pressure hydrocephalus. The bilateral ventricles were smaller than they had been on previous imaging studies. An infusion of sodium bicarbonate, a single dose of ceftriaxone, and subcutaneous heparin were admin- istered.\nOn the second day at the other hospital, the white-cell count was 3800 per\nmicroliter (reference range, 4500 to 10,500), the hemoglobin level 12.8 g per deci- liter (reference range, 13.3 to 16.3), and the platelet count 75,000 per microliter (reference range, 150,000 to 400,000). The d-dimer level was 229,926 ng per milli- liter (reference range, 0 to 500), the fibrinogen level 180 mg per deciliter (reference range, 200 to 393), the international normalized ratio 1.2 (reference range, 0.9 to\n1.1)\t, and the prothrombin time 13.5 seconds (reference range, 10.6 to 13.4). Sub- cutaneous heparin was stopped. During the next 3 days, pancytopenia worsened and the creatinine level increased. On the fifth hospital day, doxycycline was administered, and the patient was transferred to this hospital for further treatment.\nThe patient had a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic kidney disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, mild dementia, hyperten- sion, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease, which had led to multivessel coronary-artery bypass grafting 14 years earlier and to the place- ment of drug-eluting coronary stents 11 months before this evaluation. He had been treated for Lyme disease 3 years before this evaluation. Medications included aspirin, clopidogrel, atorva- statin, ezetimibe, isosorbide mononitrate, meto- prolol succinate, and amlodipine. Penicillin had reportedly caused anaphylaxis. The patient was a widower and lived in a house in New England with his son, daughter-in-law, and grandson, with- out pets. He had previously worked as a home inspector; in retirement, he enjoyed reading and spending time outside. The patient used a walker for ambulation and was able to perform most activities of daily living; he required assistance from his family and home health services for activities requiring more advanced executive function. He did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicitdrugs. His mother had had heart disease; his father had had dementia.\nThe temperature was 37.3\u00b0C, the pulse 93 beats per minute, the blood pressure 153/68 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 90% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.7. On examination, the patient was oriented to self and location. The mucous membranes were dry, and the neck was supple. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy, bruising, or rash. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nBlood cultures were obtained. Blood levels of\nvitamin B12 and folate were normal. Other labo- ratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Eric W. Zhang: CT of the chest (Fig. 1A), performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, revealed symmetric pul- monary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. There were scattered mildly enlarged mediasti- nal lymph nodes, measuring up to 1.4 cm in short-axis diameter. CT of the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1B and 1C), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material,showed cholelithiasis with trace pericholecystic fluid and mild gallbladder-wall thickening. Follow- up ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of chole- cystitis; Murphy\u2019s sign was negative.\nDr. Mewaldt: Doxycycline and intravenous fluids containing sodium bicarbonate were continued. Metoprolol, amlodipine, and isosorbide mono- nitrate were administered.\nOn the second day at this hospital, the hema- tology service was consulted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed red cells with hypochromic forms, scattered schistocytes (3 per high-power field), and echinocytes. Atypical neu- trophils without dysplasia were present, and there were no immature forms or blasts. The platelets were decreased in number and well granulated, without clumping and with some scattered larger forms.\nOn the third hospital day, tretinoin (often called all-trans retinoic acid) was administered because of concerns about acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). On the fourth hospital day, ad- ditional diagnostic test results were received.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. David B. Sykes: This elderly man suddenly be- came ill and was admitted to this hospital in the context of an undiagnosed systemic process as- sociated with multiple laboratory abnormalities, including pancytopenia, with concerns about possible hemolysis and disseminated intravascu- lar coagulation (DIC). In complex medical cases in which teams from multiple medical subspe- cialties may be consulted, it can be tempting to formulate a long list of potential diagnoses; however, it is often more useful to consider the available information with the goal of moving diagnoses down or completely off the list. With this case, we are charged with determining whether this patient\u2019s constellation of symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are related to a primary hematologic problem or are secondary to a nonhematologic process.\nTo start building a differential diagnosis, we\ncan focus on two features of this case: pancyto- penia and renal failure. The patient\u2019s laboratory test results initially suggest dysregulated coagu- lation and the potential for hemolysis. These results prompt us to assemble a list of \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d hematologic conditions \u2014 conditions that, if untreated, could rapidly result in complications or death (Table 2). Many of these diag- noses stick in the memory as convenient three- letter acronyms, with destructive processes such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome at the top of the list of diagnoses that can result in pancytopenia and renal failure.\n\nHemolysis\nDoes this patient have hemolysis? He presented with progressive anemia and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level, findings that prompt con- sideration of hemolysis. Of note, his serum haptoglobin level was slightly elevated at 277 mg per deciliter (reference range, 30 to 200 mg per deciliter). Haptoglobin is a protein produced by the liver that forms a complex with free plasma hemoglobin, and the haptoglobin\u2013hemoglobin complex is cleared by CD163-expressing macro- phages of the reticuloendothelial system. This process, which protects organs from the highly oxidative nature of hemoglobin, lowers the se- rum haptoglobin level.\nWhat is the likelihood that a patient with\nclinically significant hemolysis would have a normal serum haptoglobin level? The interpreta- tion of a low haptoglobin level (<30 mg per deciliter) or low-normal haptoglobin level (30 to 100 mg per deciliter) is subject to confounding variables, including liver dysfunction, chronic hemolysis, mechanical hemolysis, recent trans- fusion, and congenital anhaptoglobinemia. How- ever, an elevated haptoglobin level, as seen in this patient, is more reliable.\nIn realizing that this one laboratory value dramatically alters the differential diagnosis, I would obtain the measurement again, thereby avoiding the rare but real possibility of a pre- analytical error, such as the presence of the wrong patient\u2019s blood in the tube.1 Under the assumption that the correct patient\u2019s blood was tested, a haptoglobin level of 277 mg per deci- liter argues strongly against the possibility of hemolysis.\n\nLactate Dehydrogenase Level\nThis patient\u2019s lactate dehydrogenase level was markedly elevated at 2592 U per liter, a level that is more than 10 times the upper limit of the normal range. Although an elevated lactate dehydrogenase level is most often attributed to the breakdown of erythrocytes, it is important to remember that lactate dehydrogenase activity is present in all tissues. Lactate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the bidirectional conversion be- tween lactate and pyruvate, is an enzyme tetra- mer composed of H and M subunits. Five isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase can be distinguished in the blood on the basis of the composition of the subunits. Isoform 1 (H4) predominates in cardiac myocytes and erythrocytes, whereas isoform 5 (M4) is found in hepatocytes and skeletal myocytes.\nGiven the concomitant elevation of this pa-\ntient\u2019s creatine kinase level (6290 U per liter), alanine aminotransferase level (195 U per liter), and aspartate aminotransferase level (583 U per liter), the lactate dehydrogenase isoform detected in his blood is most likely isoform 5, released from cells in his liver and skeletal muscle. Specialized testing can be performed to distinguish the lac- tate dehydrogenase isoform, but I do not think such testing is clinically necessary in this case.\n \nPancytopenia\nOver the course of the 5-day admission at the other hospital, the patient\u2019s hematocrit fell from 37.8% to 27.8%, his platelet count fell from 121,000 to 21,000 per microliter, and his white- cell count fell from 4500 to 3710 per microliter. At this hospital, examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a few schistocytes (3 per high- power field) but was otherwise unrevealing. Is there a primary hematologic cause underlying this patient\u2019s worsening pancytopenia, or are these changes consistent with what we would expect in the context of another critical illness? I suspect that this patient\u2019s anemia is due to the combination of three factors: decreased erythrocyte production, increased erythrocyte turnover, and iatrogenic enthusiasm (i.e., anemia associated with excessive phlebotomy). He almost certainly had anemia associated with inflamma- tion, in which increased levels of hepcidin, inter- leukin 6, interferon-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 led to temporary inhibition of new red-cell production (reticulocyte count, <0.5%), as well as a shortened erythrocyte life span and in- creased erythrophagocytosis within the reticulo- endothelial system.2\nThe combination of a patient with an undiag- nosed condition and involvement of multiple subspecialty consultant teams often leads to a broad diagnostic laboratory workup, including the usual daily tests and blood counts as well as an extensive search for infectious or rheumato- logic causes. In this case, the workup was prob- ably repeated at both hospitals. Using a rough calculation, I estimate that this patient\u2019s iatro- genic blood loss over the course of 5 days would have easily exceeded 500 ml, with a resultant predictable contribution to his anemia.\nThrombocytopenia in a critically ill patient can\nbe due to several causes.3 In this case, a diagno- sis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura seems unlikely, and the timing of heparin exposure makes a diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombo- cytopenia also unlikely.\n\nAcute Promyelocytic Leukemia and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation\nAPL is high on the list of \u201ccan\u2019t miss\u201d hemato- logic diagnoses, given its association with DIC and the potential for rapid decompensation and death early during the disease. Current treatment of APL with prodifferentiation therapy (e.g., treti- noin) is a success story in oncology. Before the identification of tretinoin, a diagnosis of APL was akin to a death sentence, with low survival rates. Now, APL is the most treatable form of adult acute leukemia, with survival rates higher than 90%.4\nA diagnosis of acute leukemia is usually con- sidered when the white-cell count is highly ele- vated and circulating blasts are identified on examination of a peripheral-blood smear. How- ever, APL has the potential to manifest in an unusual fashion, with a low white-cell count in peripheral blood and an absence of circulating leukemic blasts, a combination of findings that is sometimes referred to as aleukemic leukemia. In such cases of APL, the bone marrow may still be packed with malignant promyelocytes that crowd out the normal progenitors (with resulting pancytopenia), but these promyelocytes remain tethered within the marrow, as would be expected of their normal promyelocyte counterparts.\nIt is with this possibility in mind that we\n \nevaluate this patient\u2019s laboratory test results in order to consider underlying DIC. Although the partial-thromboplastin time is quite prolonged (61.8 sec) and the d-dimer level is markedly ele- vated (>10,000 ng per milliliter), these values are out of proportion to the nearly normal interna- tional normalized ratio (1.2) and fibrinogen level (144 mg per deciliter). DIC involves the nonspe- cific consumption of clotting factors and would not be expected to disproportionately consume factors involved in the partial-thromboplastin time relative to factors involved in the prothrom- bin time. The extent of elevation of the d-dimer level argues in favor of a widespread infection, metastatic cancer, or inflammation in the con- text of a fulminant autoimmune process. Although the prolonged partial-thromboplastin time re- mains puzzling, I wonder whether it could be a residual effect of use of subcutaneous heparin with a prolonged half-life in the context of a very low creatinine clearance. Overall, with regard to consideration of APL, this would be a very atypi- cal presentation of a rare disease, with unex- plained muscle and liver involvement despite the absence of circulating blasts and with coagula- tion test results that are inconsistent with DIC.\nSummary\nWith some sense of relief, when we return to a careful review of this patient\u2019s history, we find a couple of important clues: the patient enjoyed spending time outside and had been treated for Lyme disease 3 years earlier. These features raise the question of whether another tickborne dis- ease would explain his acute illness, widespread inflammation, and multiorgan (muscle, liver, and kidney) involvement, in addition to his bone mar- row suppression and hematologic abnormalities. Infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum \u2014 a type of intracellular bacteria that is endemic in the New England area and is transmitted by the same ixodes tick species that transmits Lyme disease \u2014 would be a unifying diagnosis in this case, which has features consistent with other reported cases.5,6 As a hematologist, I would try to make the diagnosis of anaplasmosis by re- viewing the peripheral-blood smear to identify morulae in the cytoplasm of circulating neutro- phils. However, the peripheral-blood smear was prepared after the administration of doxycycline, which reduces the sensitivity of this evaluation, and therefore, nucleic acid testing would be more reliable; it would also be helpful in ruling out infection with ehrlichia species.",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sarah E. Turbett: The diagnostic test was a nu- cleic acid test of whole blood for A. phagocytophilum, which was positive. Nucleic acid testing for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii, E. canis, and E. mu- ris\u2013like agent was negative, as was examination of a blood smear for intraerythrocytic parasites. An immunoassay for Lyme IgM and IgG was positive, as was a confirmatory Western blot test for Lyme IgG, with only five IgG bands present. The diagnosis of human granulocytic ana- plasmosis is often made by means of examina- tion of a peripheral-blood smear, serologic test- ing, or whole-blood nucleic acid testing. Although culture is the most accurate method, its use is often limited to research settings, given the expertise and specific culture require- ments needed.11 Examination of a peripheral- blood smear can be a useful tool for the diagno- sis of human granulocytic anaplasmosis but is limited by variable sensitivity (ranging from 20 to 80%); in addition, this method is labor inten- sive and requires a high degree of expertise, and these factors limit its use in the clinical set- ting.12 On serologic testing, documentation of a rise in titer by a factor of 4 between the acute and convalescent phases of infection is required for diagnosis confirmation, and antibody re- sponses can persist for months or years after infection.11 Of the available diagnostic methods, nucleic acid testing is the most widely used, with high sensitivity within the first week of illness.11 The diagnosis of Lyme disease is most com- monly made with a two-tiered approach to sero- logic testing, with an initial immunoassay fol- lowed by either a Western blot test or a second approved immunoassay, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.13 In this case, the patient\u2019s initial and confirmatory serologic test results for Lyme disease met crite- ria for positivity, with the presence of five IgG bands, a pattern most commonly seen in late infection. The patient had a known history of treated Lyme disease, and both IgM and IgG can persist for years after successful treatment of infection.14 There is no current commercially available diagnostic test that can be used to dis- tinguish past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi from recurrent infection.\nGiven the patient\u2019s history of treated Lyme disease and the time course of his symptoms,his serologic test results for Lyme disease seemed most consistent with past, treated infection. Ac- tive coinfection with B. burgdorferi, however, could not be completely ruled out.\nDr. Valentina Nardi: The bone marrow\u2013biopsy specimen and bone marrow aspirate showed marrow that was hypercellular for the patient\u2019s age, with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of cancer (Fig. 2A and 2B). The periph- eral-blood smear showed mature leukocytes with abundant toxic granulation. Very rare neutro- phils (approximately 1 in 500) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate had basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions that were suggestive of morulae of A. phagocytophilum (Fig. 2B and 2D). These findings, in conjunction with the positive blood nucleic acid test for A. phagocyto- philum, were consistent with A. phagocytophilum infection.\nFigure 2.
