    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Scott B. Silverman: A 68-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of worsening confusion.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. A myo- cardial infarction had occurred 18 years before the current admission; atrial fibril- lation had also been diagnosed at that time. He had taken warfarin for many years but had stopped taking it 10 years before this admission.\nSeven and a half weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to another hospital with aphasia. His score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 3, with scores ranging from 0 to 42 and higher scores indicating greater severity. The score of 3 was due to partial loss of the right visual field and mild-to-moderate aphasia and dysarthria.\nComputed tomography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed no abnormalities. CT angiography of the head and neck revealed calcified atherosclerosis along the arch of the aorta, the origin of the left vertebral artery, the intracranial portion of the left vertebral ar- tery, the carotid bifurcations, and the cavernous portions of both internal carotid arteries; there was no hemodynamically significant stenosis. Treatment with aspi- rin and clopidogrel was initiated. The  patient was admitted to the hospital, and  the aphasia resolved on the second hospital day.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, performed without the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a few small foci of acute infarc- tion involving the frontal lobes, the posterior limb of the right internal capsule, and the right middle cerebellar peduncle. There was also a small focus of remote petechial hemorrhage in the subcortical white matter of the left parietal lobe.\nAlthough continuous telemetry revealed no evidence of atrial fibrillation, the patient\u2019s strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, resulting from atrial fibrillation. Treatment with aspirin was continued, clopidogrel was discontinued, and apixa- ban was started; previously prescribed antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine and lisinopril was resumed. The patient was dis- charged home on the second hospital day.\nFour days after discharge, and 7 weeks before the current admission, the patient presented to the other hospital with transient mild aphasia. Results of CT of the head (performed without the administration of intravenous contrast mate- rial) and MRI of the head (performed with and without the administration of intravenous con- trast material) were reportedly unchanged from the studies obtained 6 days earlier. The patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure was less than 100 mm Hg, and his symptoms were thought to be due to hypoperfusion or recrudescence of symptoms from previous stroke. Treatment with amlodipine and lisinopril was stopped, and the systolic blood pressure increased. The patient was dis- charged home on the fourth hospital day.\nThree weeks after discharge, and 3.5 weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s daugh- ter noticed that the patient had confusion and lethargy, and she took him to the other hospital for evaluation. She reported that he had new urinary incontinence, unsteady gait, and with- drawn affect. MRI of the head, performed with- out the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona ra- diata bilaterally.\nDr. Javier M. Romero: CT of the chest (Fig. 1A)\nrevealed diffuse emphysematous changes, includ- ing a spiculated mass (1.7 cm in diameter) with perilesional rectilinear markings in the lower lobe of the left lung.  CT  of  the  abdomen  (Fig. 1B) revealed an exophytic hyperdense mass (1.6 cm in diameter) arising from the anterior cortex of the left kidney.\nDr. Silverman: On the fourth hospital day, the\npatient was transferred to a rehabilitation facil- ity with plans for an oncology evaluation after discharge. After 10 days at the rehabilitation center, he was discharged home.\nThree days after discharge from the rehabili- tation center, and 1 week before the current ad- mission, numbness and tingling in the right  hand and forearm developed, and the patient\u2019s daughter again took the patient to the other hospital. On examination, he had pronator drift of the right arm and dysmetria on finger-to-nose testing. MRI of the head revealed new foci of acute infarction involving the left thalamus, the subcortical white matter of the right frontal  lobe, and the periventricular white matter on the left side, but there was no hemorrhage. Treat- ment with apixaban was stopped, and enoxapa- rin was started. The patient was discharged home on the third hospital day.\nFive days after discharge, the patient\u2019s daugh- ter noticed that the patient had new difficulty with swallowing pills and worsening confusion, and she brought him to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital for evaluation. The patient was not able to provide additional history, but his daughter reported that his aphasia and dif- ficulty with balance had worsened since dis- charge from the other hospital. Other medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Medications in- cluded enoxaparin, aspirin, atorvastatin, and met- formin. There were no known drug allergies. The patient lived alone in a suburb of Boston and was retired. He had smoked cigarettes for 40 years, but he had recently decreased tobacco use from one pack per day to three cigarettes per day. He smoked marijuana occasionally, and he drank alcohol rarely. His father had had coro- nary artery disease with a myocardial infarction in the fourth decade of life.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the\nblood pressure 158/75 mm Hg, the pulse 70 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body- mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 25.1. The patient was alert and interactive. He was able to answer orientation questions correctly, although he was slow to respond. His speech was fluent, with no paraphasic errors. He had some diffi- culty with following simple commands and was unable to follow complex commands. There was decreased activation of the right nasolabial fold with preserved wrinkling of the forehead. Prona- tor drift of the right arm was present, and there was mild hemiparesis on the right side. The re- mainder of the examination was normal.\nBlood  levels  of  electrolytes  and rheumatoid\nfactor were normal, as were results of liver- function and kidney-function tests. The hemo- globin level was 12.7 g per deciliter (reference range, 13.5 to 17.5); the remainder of the com- plete  blood  count  with  differential  count was\nnormal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 15 mm per hour (reference range, 0 to 13). The d-dimer level was 912 ng per milliliter (refer- ence value, <500). Urinalysis showed more than 100 white cells per high-power field (reference value, <10). A test for lupus anticoagulant was negative, as were tests for antibodies against cardiolipin and \u03b22-glycoprotein 1. Antinuclear antibodies were present at a titer of 1:160 in a speckled pattern. Blood specimens were obtained for culture. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Romero: CT angiography of the head and neck (Fig. 1C), performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed focal encephalomalacia within the left frontal corona radiata and right  cerebral  pedun- cle. Atheromatous changes had resulted in mul- tifocal mild narrowing of the cervical and intra- cranial arteries. MRI of the head  (Fig.  1D  and 1E), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed  numer-  ous new small foci of acute infarction involving the centrum semiovale and corona radiata bilat- erally, the left thalamus, the left internal capsule and lentiform nucleus, the left  subinsular  re-  gion, the medial right precentral gyrus, the an- terior right  frontal  lobe,  the  superior  frontal gyri, and the right temporal  lobe.  There  were  also several scattered patches of increased signal intensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and T2-weighted imaging, find- ings that are indicative of moderate small-vessel disease.\nDr. Silverman: The patient was admitted to the hospital, and intravenous heparin was adminis- tered. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the second hospital day revealed a normal ejection fraction and no valvular vegetations or patent foramen ovale. Blood cultures showed no growth.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Aneesh B. Singhal: In this 68-year-old man, multiple focal and nonfocal neurologic deficits developed over a period of 7 weeks, along with cognitive decline. Imaging revealed  accumulat-  ing multifocal small ischemic lesions and white- matter lesions. In addition, lung and  kidney masses that were suggestive of cancer were identified. Determining the cause of the strokes   in this patient is important to assess the risk of recurrence and initiate appropriate preventive therapy. The correlation between clinical and imaging findings provides important diagnostic clues, as does the distribution of the ischemic lesions. Stroke classification schemas1,2 can be helpful in considering potential mechanisms  of the strokes in this patient.\n\nMechanisms of Stroke\nSmall-Vessel Disease\nAlthough this patient had small infarcts, small- vessel disease can be ruled out as the cause of his strokes because he did not have a lacunar syndrome. Patients with stroke that is caused by small-vessel disease typically have single infarcts in the distribution of penetrating cerebral arter- ies, which have been affected by lipohyalinosis associated with chronic hypertension and have become occluded.3\n\nCardioembolism\nThis patient had longstanding atrial fibrillation, which is the most frequent cause of stroke in the United States. At the time of his initial presenta- tion, 7.5 weeks before the current admission, he was not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, which reduces the risk of stroke by approxi- mately 60%. He had aphasia and hemianopia, which are typical of cardioembolism to the left middle cerebral artery. However, imaging re- vealed scattered small infarcts in deep regions of the brain and not the wedge-shaped larger infarcts that are more typical of atrial fibrillation\u2013 related stroke.\nAphasia recurred a few days later, but imag- ing revealed no new brain lesions. The aphasia was attributed to poststroke recrudescence, which is a consequence of previous stroke that has been characterized within the past decade.4 This patient\u2019s third and fourth hospital admis- sions were due to confusion and changes in his affect and gait, which do not fit into typical clinical stroke syndromes.5 Instead, he probably had embolic encephalopathy.6\nThe rapidly progressive clinical presentation and the infarct distribution suggest the possibil- ity of embolism that is caused by a condition other than atrial fibrillation, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, aortic arch athero- ma (cholesterol embolism), infective endocardi- tis, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, cardiac tumor, or cardiomyopathy. However, the patient had a normal platelet count, negative blood cul- tures, and no abnormalities on echocardiogra- phy, and he did not have symptoms of systemic infection. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocardi- tis remains a possibility, given the likelihood of underlying cancer. However, this condition invariably results in much larger multifocal in- farcts, which are presumably due to the embolic burden associated with underlying cancer- related hypercoagulability and friable valvular vegetations.6\n\nLarge-Artery Atherosclerosis\nThis patient had several risk factors for athero- sclerosis: older age, untreated atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smok- ing, marijuana use, and a family history of early- onset coronary artery disease. It was not surpris- ing that imaging showed atherosclerosis in the extracranial and intracranial arteries, as well as white-matter lesions, which were possibly due to chronic microvascular ischemia. However, he had frequent episodes within a 4-week period, which would not be typical of stroke that is caused by atherosclerosis, especially in the con- text of treatment with antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants.7 It is possible that underlying atherosclerosis and chronic microvascular ische- mia lowered the threshold for stroke associated with other mechanisms.\nUndetermined and Other Causes\nThis patient could have had a condition known as cryptogenic embolic stroke of undetermined source. Recent studies have elucidated occult causes of this condition that can be identified with focused testing.8\nIn this patient, the overall differential diag- nosis can be narrowed on the basis of the rapid clinical progression, the infarct distribution, and the absence of nonatherosclerotic arteriopathy on CT angiography. It is important to note the location of the infarcts in the deep regions of the brain (e.g., the cerebral peduncle and forceps minor). Embolic showers from a central embolic source (e.g., a thrombus in the left atrial ap- pendage in a patient with atrial fibrillation who is not receiving anticoagulation) usually travel to distal cortical regions. In contrast, the deep loca- tion of the infarcts in this patient favors arterial thrombosis as the cause of his strokes.\n\n \nSmall-Vessel Cerebral Arteriopathies\nApproach to Diagnosis\nThis patient probably had small-vessel cerebral arteriopathy. The differential diagnosis for small- vessel cerebral arteriopathy is broad (Table 1). Diagnosis of a specific arteriopathy relies on factors such as the patient\u2019s age, the family his- tory, the tempo of progression, the presence of systemic signs (e.g., skin and retinal lesions) and extracerebral neurologic deficits (e.g., neuropa- thy), the features observed on imaging of the brain and vasculature, and the results of diag- nostic tests, including tests for inflammatory and cancer biomarkers, genetic tests, cerebrospi- nal fluid (CSF) analysis, and biopsy of the skin, temporal artery, and brain.9\n\nInfections, Inflammation, Radiation, and Drugs\nIn this patient, infectious and rheumatologic causes of small-vessel cerebral arteriopathy are unlikely owing to the absence of fever, consti- tutional symptoms, skin lesions, and signs of meningeal irritation. Nevertheless, CSF analy- sis and additional studies would be needed to rule out these conditions. Arteriopathy in- duced by radiation or drugs can be ruled out because the patient had no history of exposure to radiation or use of vasoconstrictive drugs. Although he had smoked marijuana, this drug has only weak vasoconstrictive properties and would be unlikely to cause recurrent multifo- cal infarcts.10\n\nMonogenic Conditions\nCould this patient have a genetic arteriopathy? Patients with cerebral autosomal dominant arte- riopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoen- cephalopathy (CADASIL),  which  is  caused  by a NOTCH3 mutation on chromosome 19p, can have mood disturbances, migraines, and small- vessel strokes.11 The expected MRI findings are small infarcts and white-matter changes  affect-  ing the external capsule and anterior temporal lobe. Patients with retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy and systemic man- ifestations (RVCL-S), which is caused by a TREX1 mutation, can have vision symptoms, retinal and small cerebral infarcts, and mild  liver  and  kid- ney dysfunction.12 CADASIL, RCVL-S, and other genetic arteriopathies are rare, collectively  caus- ing less than 1% of all strokes. In addition,symptoms typically develop when the patient is 25 to 50 years age, and disease progression is much slower than that observed in this pa- tient.13 Therefore, monogenic arteriopathy is unlikely.\n\nPrimary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System\nThis patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS), a rare vasculitis that is restricted to the small and medium arteries and veins of the brain, spinal cord, and leptomeninges.14-16 PACNS is most likely to occur in patients 40 to 60 years of age. It occurs twice as frequently in men as in women. The acute-to-subacute encephalopathy and multifocal neurologic deficits that were ob- served in this patient are consistent with the diagnosis of PACNS. Headache was not reported by this patient but is also common.\nThe multifocal punctate infarcts that were seen on this patient\u2019s MRI are typical of PACNS. Other potential MRI findings include diffuse bihemispheric white-matter hyperintensities, leptomeningeal enhancement, and mass lesions that mimic tumors.17 CSF analysis reveals an ele- vated protein level and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Cerebral angiography, when positive, reveals multifocal nonconcentric arterial irregularities, usually in the distal branches. However, the sen- sitivity of cerebral angiography for the diagnosis of PACNS is only 10 to 20% because PACNS predominantly affects small-caliber arteries, which cannot be visualized. Intracranial vesselwall MRI may show concentric wall thickening and contrast enhancement, features that may distinguish PACNS from other inflammatory as well as noninflammatory arteriopathies. How- ever, brain biopsy is needed for the definitive diagnosis of PACNS.18\nThe clinical course of PACNS is typically progressive.19 Treatment strategies include in- duction therapy with glucocorticoids and intra- venous cyclophosphamide, followed by mainte- nance therapy with immunomodulatory agents such as oral cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, or metho- trexate. An important mimic of PACNS is in travascular lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS); CSF analysis for malignant cells and brain biopsy are needed to rule out this entity.\nParaneoplastic Vasculitis\nAlthough PACNS is a possibility in this case, the findings on imaging of the chest and abdomen were indicative of probable cancer. Lung, gastro- intestinal, and other cancers are identified in up to 10% of patients with stroke, and stroke is the first manifestation of cancer in approximately 5% of cases.20 Common mechanisms of cancer- related stroke include hypercoagulability as well as nonbacterial (marantic) thrombotic endocar- ditis, which usually causes multifocal, widely distributed large and small infarcts.6 In rare cases, a paraneoplastic vasculitis that is similar to PACNS can result from one of the following processes: an immunologic reaction against vas- cular endothelium (molecular mimicry), endo- thelial injury due to the release of proinflamma- tory cytokines by tumor cells, or hypersensitivity to deposits of tumor protein or circulating im- mune complexes that contain tumor antigens on the vessel wall.21,22\n\nSummary\nThis patient most likely had multifocal small- vessel thrombotic strokes due to paraneoplastic cerebral vasculitis in the context of lung cancer. I suspect that, in addition to biopsy of the lung, kidney, and brain, diagnostic testing included CSF analysis and intracranial vessel-wall MRI as ad- junctive studies to assess for CNS vasculitis and to rule out diagnoses that mimic this condition.\n\n\n\n\n",

Microbiologic studies were negative.\nCore-biopsy specimens of the lung mass and mediastinal lymph nodes (Fig. 3A and 3B) showed adenocarcinoma that was composed of clusters of atypical cells with enlarged irregular nuclei and scant cytoplasm. The tumor cells were positive for TTF1 on immunohistochemical staining; this finding is consistent with primary lung adenocarcinoma. A biopsy specimen of the kidney mass (Fig. 3C, 3D, and 3E) showed bland polygonal cells that were forming tubular struc- tures. The tumor cells were positive for PAX8, this  finding  is  consistent  with  primary renal neoplasm, rather than metastasis from the lung adenocarcinoma. The tumor cells also expressed AMACR and CD117. The morphologic features and immunophenotype were consistent with low-grade papillary renal neoplasm, which has a differential diagnosis of papillary adenoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. To distinguish between these two entities, the pathological findings would need to be correlated with the results on imaging studies. However, overall, this low- grade lesion was unlikely to be the cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms.\n\n",
