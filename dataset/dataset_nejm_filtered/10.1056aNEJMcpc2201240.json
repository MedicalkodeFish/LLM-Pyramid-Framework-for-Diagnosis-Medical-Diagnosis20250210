    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. George Karandinos (Medicine): A 76-year-old man was evaluated in the emergency department of this hospital because of dizziness and altered mental status.\nOn the day of the current evaluation, the patient was observed crawling on a city sidewalk. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. On evaluation by emergency medical services, he reported feeling dizzy and \u201cweird.\u201d A fingerstick blood glu- cose level was 152 mg per deciliter (8.4 mmol per liter). He was brought to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation.\nIn the emergency department, the patient could not recall recent events, but he reported shortness of breath, as well as chronic back pain and persistent ringing in the ears. He was unable to give additional details of his history, but he pro- vided the name of the hospital where he routinely received care. On a phone con- sultation, physicians at that hospital reported that the patient had a history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine. There were no known drug allergies. The patient had consumed alcohol in the past but not for 40 years. His family history was unknown.\nThe temporal temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, the blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The pa- tient appeared disheveled and diaphoretic. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli. He was oriented to person, place, and time but only intermittently followed commands. A small superficial skin abrasion was noted above the left eyebrow. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nPoint-of-care ultrasonography, performed with an approach known as FAST (focused assessment with sonography for trauma), showed no abnormalities. The blood ethanol level was undetectable, and urine toxicologic testing was negative for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opiates. The blood levels of  lipase,  magnesium, and N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide were normal, as were results of liver-function tests. There was mild normocytic anemia, but the complete blood count with differential count was otherwise normal. Other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1. Testing of a nasopha- ryngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syn- drome coronavirus 2 was negative. Samples of blood and urine were obtained for culture. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, intra- ventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, and nonspecific minor ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Brooks P. Applewhite: Radiographs of the\nchest and pelvis showed no acute abnormalities. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the head and neck (Fig. 1A) revealed nonspecific mild white-matter changes, a nonspecific small focal calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter, atherosclerosis without high-grade cere- brovascular stenosis, and multilevel spondylotic changes without severe spinal canal stenosis. There was no evidence of acute intracranial hem- orrhage or territorial infarction. CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1B and 1C) revealed no evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, lung consolidation, or pericardial effu- sion. There was a left adrenal nodule that mea- sured 19 mm in diameter, a finding consistent with an adenoma.\nDr. Karandinos: Normal saline with 5% dex-\ntrose was administered intravenously. During the next 8 hours, the patient was agitated and com- bative. He repeatedly removed peripheral intra- venous catheters and disconnected monitors. He was no longer oriented to place or time. Two doses of olanzapine were administered intrave- nously, and the patient slept for several hours during the night.\nSixteen hours after the patient arrived in the emergency department, the temporal temperature  was  37.7\u00b0C,   the  heart  rate  78   beats  per minute, the blood pressure 160/72 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while he was breathing ambient air. The patient was observed to be breathing deeply. He was able to state his name, but his speech was otherwise nonsensical and dysarthric. He followed commands only when visual cues were given; for example, he stuck out his tongue after the examiner demonstrated the task. Motor, sensory, and reflex examinations were normal; tests of cerebellar function were not performed. Additional laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The results of electroen- cephalography (EEG) were normal, without epi- leptiform abnormalities. Normal saline with po- tassium chloride was administered intravenously, as was lorazepam. Additional imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Applewhite: Magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) of the head (Fig. 2) revealed no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute or sub- acute infarction. T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a mild burden of white-matter signal hyperintensities, which are nonspecific but typical of chronic small-vessel disease. The previously detected calcification in the right-peritrigonal white matter correlated with an 8-mm focus of T1 and T2 signal abnor- malities with associated susceptibility blooming, a finding suggestive of either a calcified cavern- ous malformation or sequelae of previous infec- tion or inflammation.\nDr. Karandinos: The patient\u2019s mental status did\nnot improve. Twenty-four hours after he arrived in the emergency department, he was admitted to the hospital with a working diagnosis of sei- zure. The temporal temperature was 37.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 77 beats per minute, the blood pres- sure 151/70 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 98% while he was breathing ambient air. Respi- ratory effort appeared increased. He was somno- lent, and he followed simple commands but did not open his eyes in response to sternal rub. The blood levels of creatine kinase, fibrinogen, and ammonia were normal. Other laboratory test re- sults are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Antonio Granfone: This 76-year-old man was initially brought to the hospital because of ab- normal behavior. While he was in the emergency department, a progressively decreased level of consciousness was observed, along with disorien- tation. I will first consider common and \u201ccannot miss\u201d causes of altered mental status; I will then use the findings on physical examination and laboratory testing to narrow the differential diagnosis.\n\nIntoxication or Withdrawal\nThe negative urine toxicologic testing makes intoxication from drugs that are commonly as- sociated with substance use disorders unlikely. Although alcohol withdrawal could cause altered mental status, ethanol was not detected, and the patient reportedly had not consumed alcohol for 40 years.\n\nToxins and Medications\nThe history obtained from the patient, although limited, does not suggest potential exposure to poisons. Lisinopril and transdermal lidocaine  are the only known prescribed medications, and neither agent is associated with altered mental status. However, it remains possible that the patient had been taking nonprescription medica- tions or supplements that can cause altered mental status.\n\nCentral Nervous System Disorders\nThe absence of fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, and leukocytosis makes an infection involving the central nervous system unlikely. However, causes of viral encephalitis \u2014 such as herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, and Powassan virus \u2014 should be considered in this patient. Given his history  of seizure disorder, seizure was considered  in the emergency department, and an EEG was\n \nobtained. The normal EEG makes seizure un- likely but does not rule out an underlying seizure disorder or a postictal state as the cause of al- tered mental status. However, I would expect an elevated creatine kinase level to be detected if the patient had had a seizure. In addition, I would expect his altered mental status to im- prove with time if it was due to a postictal state; this patient\u2019s altered mental status worsened.\n\nMetabolic Disorders\nBoth hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can cause altered mental status. Initial laboratory testing revealed a low thyrotropin level, as well as low free thyroxine and triiodothyronine lev- els. This pattern is consistent with central hypo- thyroidism, but this diagnosis is unlikely be- cause the patient did not have signs or symptoms of other pituitary-hormone deficiencies. Alterna- tive explanations for this pattern on thyroid- function testing are euthyroid sick  syndrome and malnutrition. In the context of euthyroid sick syndrome, instead of converting thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the body tries to conserve energy by converting thyroxine to reverse tri- iodothyronine. The patient\u2019s level of triiodo- thyronine was more reduced than his level of free thyroxine, which is consistent with mal- nutrition.1\nHypocalcemia  is  another  potential  cause of altered mental status, and the blood calcium level was low. The patient had concurrent alka- losis,  which enhances the binding of calcium  to albumin and further decreases the free calcium level. The ionized calcium level is not reported, so the amount of physiologically active calcium is unknown. To rule out hypocalcemia, I would obtain an ionized calcium level, but severe hypo- calcemia is unlikely to be the cause of this pa- tient\u2019s altered mental status.\n\nHypertensive Encephalopathy\nThis patient\u2019s initial blood pressure of 183/113 mm Hg suggests the possibility of hypertensive encephalopathy. However, the absence of head- ache, papilledema, acute coronary syndrome, imaging findings consistent with changes in the brain, and laboratory evidence of end-organ damage argues against hypertensive encepha- lopathy as the cause of his altered mental status.\n\nWernicke\u2019s Encephalopathy\nWernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is an important con- sideration in this patient with altered mental status. He reportedly did not drink alcohol, but he could still be at risk for Wernicke\u2019s encepha- lopathy in the context of malnutrition. Patients with Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy can present with metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and hyperventilation. Dysarthria, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities may also be present; ataxia and ocular abnormalities were not described in this case. Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy would be more likely if the altered mental status had developed after prolonged exposure to dextrose before thiamine was administered. However, this pa- tient had altered mental status on presentation and received only a minimal amount of dextrose before thiamine was administered, so Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy is unlikely.\nHyperventilation and Respiratory Alkalosis The patient initially reported dyspnea and was noted to have both deep breathing and increased work of breathing. In addition, arterial  blood gas measurements were consistent with respira- tory alkalosis, a finding that further  supports the possibility of hyperventilation. In patients with hyperventilation, alkalinization of the blood increases the oxygen avidity for hemoglobin, which decreases the availability of oxygen to per- fuse tissues, including brain cells. Hypocapnia leads to increased vascular resistance, vasocon- striction, and decreased cerebral blood flow. Patients may report breathlessness, dizziness, lightheadedness, or confusion, symptoms simi- lar to those reported by this patient. He had a history of mild pain and anxiety, but there was no evidence of psychosis, fever, intracranial ab- normalities, or cardiopulmonary disorders that would be driving hyperventilation. However, many widely available substances \u2014 such as sa- licylates, methylxanthines, catecholamine ana- logues, and nicotine \u2014 can cause hyperventilation.\n\nAnion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis\nIn addition to respiratory alkalosis, the patient had an elevated anion gap (19 mmol per liter), which indicates concurrent anion-gap metabolic acidosis. He had mild lactic acidosis and suspect-\n \ned malnutrition, with 2+ ketones in the urine, but there was no evidence of diabetic ketoacido- sis or severe renal failure. Anion-gap metabolic acidosis, in combination with hyperventilation with respiratory alkalosis and altered mental status, is suggestive of salicylate toxicity.2\n\nSalicylate Toxicity\nSources of salicylate include not only oral medi- cations but also foods, herbs,3 supplements, and topical products such as liniments and oint- ments. One teaspoon (5 ml) of some of these products contains up to 7 g of salicylate, which is equivalent to the amount in more than 21 full- dose tablets of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Sa- licylates are rapidly absorbed through the gastric mucosa; the peak blood level typically occurs within 1 hour after ingestion but may be reached more slowly with enteric-coated and extended- release preparations.4 After absorption, 90% of the salicylate molecules are protein bound. Salicylates are metabolized in the liver to salicyluric acid, which is then excreted through the kid- neys. Overdose and toxicity lead to peak levels that are higher and occur later (especially with enteric-coated or extended-release preparations), which may saturate hepatic detoxification mech- anisms, increasing the level of non\u2013protein- bound molecules in circulation and prolonging the half-life from 2 to 4 hours to up to 30 hours. Unbound molecules are excreted through the kidneys but are rapidly reabsorbed through the epithelium of the renal collecting tubule, which exacerbates toxicity.\nSalicylates activate the respiratory center of the medulla, causing hyperventilation and respi- ratory alkalosis. Tachypnea and increased respira- tory effort, which were observed in this patient, can be clues for early diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. Salicylates cause metabolic acidosis through interference with both cellular metabo- lism in the Krebs cycle and oxidative phos- phorylation, as well as through accumulation of unbound salicylate molecules.5,6 Oxidative phos- phorylation uncoupling leads to an elevated lactate level, which was seen in this patient. Un- bound salicylate molecules easily cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, which leads to altered men- tal status, neuroglycopenia,7 and cerebral edema. An elevated blood salicylate level correlates with altered mental status, and hemodialysis may be considered in patients with salicylate toxicity and altered mental status.8,9 Tinnitus, which was reported by this patient, is a side effect that can occur even with the use of therapeutic doses of salicylates, but it can also be a clue to salicylate toxicity.\nSalicylate toxicity can explain this patient\u2019s altered mental status, hyperventilation with re- spiratory alkalosis, and anion-gap metabolic acidosis. The patient had received a prescription for lidocaine patches for back pain and may have been taking other, nonprescription medications for pain. I suspect that the diagnostic test in this case  was  measurement  of  the  blood salicylate level.\n",

    "Diagnosis": "Chronic salicylate toxicity",
    "Key testing": "blood salicylate level",
    "Key testing result": "Dr. Soma Jobbagy: The diagnostic test in this case was measurement of the blood salicylate level. The patient had a salicylate level of 56 mg per deciliter (4.05 mmol per liter; reference value,\n<20 mg per deciliter [1.45 mmol per liter]), a finding that confirmed the diagnosis of salicy- late toxicity.\nThe assay that is used to measure the salicy- late level relies on hydroxylation and simultane- ous decarboxylation of salicylate by the enzyme salicylate hydroxylase to yield catechol, along with concomitant stoichiometric oxidation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide (NADH) to nicotinamide adenine dinucle- otide (NAD+). The consumption of NADH is measured spectrophotometrically according to the change in absorption at 340 nm.10\nSalicylate hydroxylase does not have complete substrate specificity. Medicinal salicylate prepa- rations include esters and analogues of salicylic acid, and these compounds are substrates with variable efficiency.11 Salicylic acid is a commonly used topical medication for dermatologic condi- tions, and toxic effects from percutaneous ab- sorption have been reported.12 Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) undergoes rapid enteric and he- patic hydrolysis to salicylic acid, which is the preferred substrate for salicylate hydroxylase. However, the enzyme also shows activity toward the acetyl ester. Likewise, methylsalicylate \u2014 found in topical analgesic agents, mouthwash, and oil of wintergreen \u2014 is metabolized to sali- cylic acid but also is itself a low-efficiency sub- strate.13 Other therapeutically relevant salicylate analogues that may be detected by the assay in- clude 5-aminosalicylate (mesalamine) and the antitubercular compound 4-aminosalicylate. Re- sults of salicylate testing should be interpreted within the context of the clinical history to de- termine the intoxicating agent.\n",
