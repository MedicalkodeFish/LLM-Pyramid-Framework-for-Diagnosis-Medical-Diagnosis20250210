    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Sarimer Sanchez (Medicine): A 37-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of a facial droop, dysarthria, and kidney failure.\nThe patient had been well until 1 week before admission, when weakness of the right arm and hand developed, along with difficulty with balance while walking. Two days before admission, the patient was told by family members that his speech sounded slurred while he was speaking on the telephone. On the day of admission, the family members noticed that the patient had new facial asymmetry that had not been present 2 months earlier; in addition, he paused for extended periods of time before answering questions and spoke with slow and slurred speech. The family members brought the patient to the emergency department of this hospital for evaluation.\nOn evaluation, the patient reported malaise and lethargy. He vomited once in the emergency department but reported no nausea or abdominal or flank pain. He had no fever, chills, headache, vision changes, dysuria, hematuria, or urinary fre- quency or urgency. There was a history of depression, anxiety, and attention defi- cit\u2013hyperactivity disorder. The patient had used heroin intravenously since he was 16 years of age and frequently missed veins during injections; his last injection was on the morning of this evaluation. On rare occasions, he had used cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, lysergic acid diethylamide, amphetamines, prescription opiates, benzodiazepines, and marijuana. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years and seldom drank alcohol. The patient had previously been homeless, but at the time of this evaluation, he was living alone in an apartment. He was unemployed but had previously worked in international nonprofit consulting. He had never been sexually active. His father, brother, sister, and paternal cousin had substance use disorders; his mother was healthy. The patient took no medications and had no known drug allergies.\nThe temperature was 36.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 130/86 mm Hg, the pulse 92\nbeats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 26.6. The patient appeared chronically ill, with a flat affect. He was alert and oriented but had difficulty stating the days of the week backward. He was able to follow simple com- mands after a delay. His speech was slow and dysarthric. There was a facial droop on the right side. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Strength was 4+/5 in the right arm and 5\u2212/5 in the right leg. Pronator drift was present on the right side. Strength was normal in the left arm and leg. Sensation and deep-tendon reflexes were normal. The Babinski reflex was present in the right foot. Dorsiflexion of the ankles was followed by seven beats of clonus on the right foot and three on the left foot. There was inter- mittent spontaneous shaking of the right leg in episodes of approximately 10 seconds in dura- tion. Examination of the skin revealed multiple track marks on the arms, with scattered areas of erythematous induration without fluctuance or tenderness. The remainder of the examination was normal.\nResults of liver-function tests were normal, as were results of routine urine and blood toxico- logic screening. The blood level of urea nitrogen was 124 mg per deciliter (44.3 mmol per liter; reference range, 8 to 25 mg per deciliter [2.9 to\n8.9 mmol per liter]), creatinine 16.1 mg per deci- liter (1423 \u03bcmol per liter; reference range, 0.6 to\n1.5 mg per deciliter [53 to 133 \u03bcmol per liter]), and carbon dioxide 9 mmol per liter (reference range, 23 to 32). Four years before this evalua- tion, the creatinine level had been normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Examination of the urinary sediment revealed granular casts and scattered white cells, with no cellular casts. Tests for antinuclear anti- bodies, anti\u2013double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), and rheumatoid factor were negative. Blood lev- els of C3, C4, lactate dehydrogenase, and gly- cated hemoglobin were normal. Blood samples were obtained for culture. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and 2 anti- bodies and p24 antigen was nonreactive; plasma HIV type 1 RNA was not detected. Tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV) core IgM, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, Treponema pallidum antibodies, and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were negative. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Myco- bacterium tuberculosis was negative, and 1,3-\u03b2-d- glucan was not detected on a blood test. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Otto Rapalino: Computed tomography (CT) of the head (Fig. 1A), performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed areas of ill-defined hypoattenuation in the deep frontal white matter and striatal region on the left side. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head (Fig. 1B through 1F), performed with- out the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an expansile lesion in the deep gray nuclei and deep white matter on the left side that was associated with signal hyper- intensity on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and with increased perfusion on arterial spin labeling imaging. Within the abnormality, there was a 4-mm focus of restricted diffusion in the left globus pallidus and the posterior limb of the left internal cap- sule. There was associated mass effect with partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle and a rightward midline shift of 7 mm.\nDr. Sanchez: Vancomycin, cefepime, and metro-\nnidazole were administered. The patient was admitted to the hospital. Seven hours after anti- microbial therapy was initiated, a lumbar punc- ture was performed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The opening pressure was 23 cm of water, and the CSF was colorless. The glucose and total protein levels were normal, the total nucleated-cell count was 1 per microliter (refer- ence range, 0 to 5), and the red-cell count was\n61 per microliter (reference range, 0 to 5). Gram\u2019s staining of the CSF revealed a moderate amount of mononuclear cells, rare polymorpho- nucleocytes, and no organisms.\nDr. Rapalino: The next day, renal ultrasonogra- phy (Fig. 2) revealed mildly enlarged kidneys (right kidney measuring 12.7 cm in length and left kidney 13.5 cm; reference range, 10.1 to 12.8)1 with normal parenchymal echotexture. The left kidney had multiple simple-appearing cysts, and there was no hydronephrosis. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed with- out the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed splenomegaly but was other- wise unremarkable.\nDr. Sanchez: On the third hospital day, compre- hensive transthoracic echocardiography revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 66% with no valvular abnormalities; these findings were confirmed on transesophageal echocardiography. During the next 3 days, the patient\u2019s neurologic deficits did not improve. Fluids containing sodi- um bicarbonate were administered intravenously; the carbon dioxide level increased to 19 mmol per liter. The creatinine level decreased to 10.5 mg per deciliter (928 \u03bcmol per liter). No Bence Jones protein was detected in urine. Cultures of blood and CSF samples obtained 72 hours earlier were without growth. On the fourth hospital day, the patient reported more fatigue; there were more errors in his speech, and he was slower to re- spond to questions. Positron-emission tomogra- phy of the skull base to midthighs, performed after the intravenous administration of 18F-fluo- rodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed nonspe- cific foci of moderate FDG uptake in a multi- nodular goiter but showed no other abnormal FDG uptake.\nOn the sixth hospital day, seizurelike activity was observed. Lorazepam and levetiracetam were administered. On a repeat blood test, the 1,3-\u03b2-d- glucan level was 256 pg per milliliter (reference range, <60). A stereotactic biopsy of the lesion involving the left internal capsule was performed with CT guidance, and grossly purulent material was aspirated. Pathological examination revealed debris with abundant neutrophils and fungal hyphae.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Jeffrey S. Berns: This 37-year-old man with a his- tory of injection-drug use presented with a facial droop and mild weakness on the right side, dys- arthria that had apparently been caused by a fungal brain abscess, and severe kidney failure. The first question in developing a differential di- agnosis is whether the patient has one process that can explain all the findings or has two unre- lated life-threatening diseases. Although several features of the presentation could ultimately lead us to the correct diagnosis, I will focus on causes of the kidney disease in order to identify a unify- ing diagnosis that explains the development of  a brain abscess.\nGiven that this patient reportedly had had normal kidney function 4 years earlier, there are several questions to consider: Is the kidney fail- ure acute or chronic? What structures in the kidney are affected? And, if the glomeruli are primarily involved, is the disorder inflammatory (\u201cnephritic\u201d) or noninflammatory (\u201cnephrotic\u201d)?\n\nKidney Failure\nClinical features suggestive of acute kidney fail- ure include the absence of reduced kidney size on imaging studies, oliguria, and the recent onset of symptoms or other manifestations of systemic disease. Patients who have few uremic symptoms despite the presence of severe azote- mia and small kidneys are more likely to have chronic kidney disease than acute kidney failure. Urinalysis can be extremely helpful; the presence of dysmorphic red cells and red-cell casts, for instance, suggests acute glomerulonephritis. Other routine laboratory tests are not very dis-\n \nKidney Disease Associated with Injection- Drug Use\nSeveral kidney diseases are associated with injec- tion-drug use. HIV, HCV, and HBV infections are associated with specific glomerulopathies. Pa- tients with HIV-associated nephropathy can pre- sent with advanced kidney failure and nephrotic- range proteinuria. They often have normal-sized or large kidneys on ultrasonography, but the kidneys are often described as being very \u201cecho- dense,\u201d2 which was not the case in this patient. The typical finding on histologic analysis of a renal biopsy specimen is focal segmental glo- merulosclerosis, commonly with dilated tubules and extensive chronic interstitial nephritis. Acute, immune complex\u2013mediated glomerulonephritis can also occur.\nKidney diseases that can develop in patients\nwith HCV or HBV infection include membrano- proliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, and polyarteritis nodosa.3,4 Heroin- associated nephropathy, which shares some clini- cal and pathological features with HIV-associated nephropathy, has become uncommon in recent years.5 Bacterial infections and, much less com- monly, fungal infections related to injection- drug use can lead to acute, immune complex\u2013 mediated, crescentic glomerulonephritis. Fungi can also cause granulomatous interstitial nephri- tis. Thrombotic microangiopathy has been as- sociated with the use of cocaine and, to a lesser extent, with other drugs. Pauci-immune vasculi- tis has been associated with cocaine as well as with levamisole, an adulterant that is mixed into cocaine.6,7\nGiven this patient\u2019s nephrotic-range protein-uria, I will focus the differential diagnosis on glomerular diseases. The patient had a clinically significant component of nonalbumin protein- uria. This finding is often due to the presence of immunoglobulin light chains in the urine, but a test for these was negative, suggesting the pos- sibility of a concomitant tubulointerstitial dis- ease process that led to urinary excretion of abnormal amounts of low-molecular-weight proteins, a feature referred to as tubular protein- uria. Increased blood levels of kappa and lambda light chains, which were observed in this patient, are typically found in patients with reduced kid- ney function, with a greater elevation of kappa than of lambda light chains and with an increase in the kappa:lambda ratio.8 In addition, the pres- ence of glucosuria in the absence of hyperglyce- mia suggests the possibility of a tubulointersti- tial disease causing proximal tubular dysfunction, given that virtually all filtered glucose is nor- mally reabsorbed in this nephron segment.\n\nPrimary Glomerular Disease\nIn this case, it is worth considering primary glomerular diseases that would be unrelated to the neurologic process and fungal brain lesion, including IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glo- merulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. Patients with these diseases can present with severe kidney failure and nephrotic-range pro- teinuria. They usually present for medical care early in the disease process because of the devel- opment of edema, hematuria (in the case of IgA nephropathy), or other symptoms, but late pre- sentations can occur. These three entities together account for at least 50% of the presentations with primary glomerular diseases that occur in this patient\u2019s age group. Although there is no diagnostic blood test for IgA nephropathy or fo- cal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the blood test for antibodies to the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R antibodies) is sensitive and highly specific for membranous nephropathy.8,9 A renal biopsy would be required for diagnosing the other disorders. IgA nephropathy and, less commonly, membranous nephropathy can man- ifest as a rapidly progressive endocapillary pro- liferative crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n\nInfection-Associated Immune Complex\u2013 Mediated Glomerulonephritis\nIn the presence of injection-drug use, an acute, immune complex\u2013mediated, proliferative glomer- ulonephritis that is often associated with glo- merular crescents and with a rapidly progressive course must be considered.10 This manifestation may be related to infective endocarditis, acute or chronic skin infections, other superficial or deep-seated bacterial infections, or, in rare cases, fungal infections. Hypocomplementemia is often present. In recent years, there has been recogni- tion of an immune complex\u2013mediated glomeru-\n \nlonephritis associated with glomerular deposits that are often IgA dominant or codominant with IgG or C3. This type of glomerulonephritis is related to infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or, less commonly, methicil- lin-sensitive S. aureus or other staphylococci. Some affected patients have had positive tests for cyto- plasmic ANCAs (to proteinase 3), perinuclear ANCAs (to myeloperoxidase), or both or for other cellular antigens.\n\nAA Amyloidosis\nSerum amyloid A protein is an acute-phase reac- tant that is produced mainly in the liver; its plasma level can increase from approximately\n0.03 mg per deciliter to 100 to 200 mg per deci- liter in the presence of inflammatory diseases.11 Systemic AA amyloidosis results from tissue deposition of fibrils of serum amyloid A protein. AA amyloidosis occurs primarily in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or inflam- matory bowel disease) or chronic infections (e.g., osteomyelitis or tuberculosis); in some pa- tients, the cause is not identified. In recent years, presumably with improved treatments, some of these disorders are now less commonly associ- ated with AA amyloidosis.12 However, there ap- pears to have been an increase over the past decade or two in the fraction of patients with AA amyloidosis who have chronic skin or other soft- tissue infections related to injection-drug use, caused by what is often referred to as \u201cskin pop- ping\u201d or \u201cmuscling.\u201d13-15\nIn patients with AA amyloidosis, kidney in-\nvolvement is nearly universal, typically resulting in reduced kidney function and proteinuria that may be in the nephrotic range. Microscopic he- maturia may be present but is not common. Many patients present with advanced chronic kidney disease that may progress rapidly, over a period of months, to end-stage kidney failure. Some patients have proximal tubular dysfunction or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. There are very rare reports of crescentic pauci-immune glo- merulonephritis, perhaps related to rupture of glomerular capillary loops due to amyloid depo- sition.\nIn cases of AA amyloidosis associated with injection-drug use, heroin is the most com- monly implicated drug. A specific type of heroin, \u201cblack tar,\u201d may be more likely to cause AA amyloidosis than other types.15 Most patients who have AA amyloidosis associated with heroin use have evidence of HCV infection; HIV and HBV infections are less common.\nOn the basis of this patient\u2019s history and the features of his presentation, the most likely cause of severe kidney failure is AA amyloidosis associated with heroin use. In establishing this diagnosis, abdominal fat-pad aspiration may be useful for the detection of systemic amyloidosis. However, in this patient, a renal biopsy is war- ranted. Although there is some concern regard- ing an elevated risk of bleeding associated with renal biopsy in patients with amyloidosis, the elevation in risk is not significant.16\n\nFungal Brain Abscess\nIn this case, the one loose end is the concurrent development of a fungal brain abscess. The most likely explanation is that the patient unfortu- nately acquired two diseases related to injection- drug use. It is likely that a fungus gained portal of entry through injection-drug use and hema- togenously spread to the brain, causing an ab- scess. This process was probably exacerbated in the context of profound acidosis and severe kid- ney failure.\n\n\n\n",

The amorphous material is also pale on periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining (Panel B). Arterioles show involvement by similar material, which is strongly congophilic on Congo red staining (Panel C, arrows) and shows apple\u2011green birefringence under polarized light (Panel D), findings indicative of amyloid. On immunofluorescence studies, the material is positive for amyloid A (Panel E) and negative for other reactants (not shown). An electron microscopic study (Panel F) shows extensive deposition of haphazardly arranged nonbranching fibrils (inset; mean fibril diameter, 10.6 nm), a finding consistent with amyloid.\n\nRenal Findings\nDr. Veronica E. Klepeis: The portion of the renal biopsy specimen that was submitted for light microscopy consisted of two cores of renal cor- tex with 44 glomeruli, 1 of which was globally sclerosed and 41 of which showed segmental or global mesangial expansion and capillary-wall thickening with pale amorphous eosinophilic material (Fig. 3). Arterioles showed deposition of similar material. The amorphous material was also pale on periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining and was strongly positive on Congo red staining, with apple-green birefringence under polarized light, a finding consistent with amyloid. Congo red staining also revealed focal amyloid deposi- tion in the interstitium and, rarely, in tubular basement membranes. No segmental scarring, crescents, necrosis, or thrombi were identified. There was advanced interstitial fibrosis and tu- bular atrophy, as well as moderate interstitial inflammation, which was composed of mostly lymphocytes with a few eosinophils and plasma cells and was located mainly in areas of scar- ring. Tubules showed evidence of injury in the form of luminal dilatation, brush-border loss, and epithelial-cell flattening.\nImmunofluorescence  studies  performed on\nfrozen tissue revealed strong staining of extra- cellular mesangial material for amyloid A and was negative for other reactants, including IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, and kappa and lambda immu- noglobulin light chains. There was also focally positive staining for amyloid A in vessels. Electron microscopy revealed extensive deposition of haphazardly arranged nonbranching fibrils in the mesangium and along the glomerular base- ment membrane, with a mean (\u00b1SD) fibril diam- eter of 10.6\u00b11 nm, a feature consistent with amyloid. The amyloid deposition was associated with widespread effacement of podocyte foot processes. No electron-dense deposits were iden- tified. Focal amyloid deposition was also present in tubular basement membranes.\nThe overall findings were consistent with AA amyloidosis with extensive involvement of glom- eruli, as well as vascular and occasional tubu- lointerstitial involvement. Other histologic features included acute tubular injury and advanced chronic parenchymal changes. The interstitium showed chronic active interstitial inflammation, which is not typically associated with amyloid but has been reported in AA amyloidosis17 and warranted evaluation for other potential causes.\n\nMicrobiologic Findings\nDr. Melis N. Anahtar: Histologic examination of the lesion involving the left internal capsule revealed a cerebral abscess with numerous fun gal hyphae that were easily seen on hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 4). The hyphae were broad, measuring 5 to 15 \u03bcm in width, with oc- casional ribbonlike forms, very rare septations, and predominantly wide-angle branching. Go- mori methenamine silver staining weakly out- lined the hyphae. The histologic appearance of a pauciseptate hyaline mold was most consistent with an organism in the order mucorales, of which rhizopus species are the most common.18 No growth was observed on fungal culture.\nSubsequently, frozen brain tissue was sent to a reference laboratory for mucorales-specific poly- merase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing, which de- tected Rhizopus oryzae complex DNA. Of note, the organism was not detected in either paraffin- embedded or frozen brain tissue when a broad- range fungal PCR assay was performed, which highlights the increased sensitivity of pathogen- specific nested PCR methods.\nR. oryzae is a ubiquitous environmental patho- gen that is commonly found in soil and rotting fruit. It grows rapidly in vivo, resulting in aggres- sive infections associated with high mortality. The majority of patients with mucormycosis have an underlying predisposing condition, such as poorly controlled diabetes, cancer, a history of solid-organ transplantation, or injection-drug use.19 This patient had an additional risk factor, metabolic acidosis, which promotes R. oryzae growth by increasing the availability of free iron in the serum and impairing phagocyte function.\nFigure 4.

The hyphae are broad with wide\u2011angle branching and very rare septations (arrowheads).",
