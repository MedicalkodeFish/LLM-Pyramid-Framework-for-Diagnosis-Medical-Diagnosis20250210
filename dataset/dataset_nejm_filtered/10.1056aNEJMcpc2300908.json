    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Elliott Winford (Medicine): An 86-year-old man was admitted to this hospital because of shortness of breath.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of health until 6 months before the current admission, when he began to have shortness of breath that occurred in- termittently during his daily walk of 1 to 2 miles. Ten weeks before the current admission, posterior lumbar decompression was performed for the treatment of spinal stenosis. The patient healed from the surgery; however, as his mobility in- creased, he noticed that shortness of breath occurred more frequently.\nDuring the 7 weeks after the surgery, shortness of breath occurred with de- creasing levels of exertion. Three weeks before the current admission, the patient\u2019s symptoms worsened such that he was unable to walk across a room, and he sought evaluation in the primary care clinic of another hospital. The d-dimer level was 3220 ng per milliliter (reference value, <500), and he was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital.\nOn evaluation in the emergency department, the patient described shortness of breath that was worse with exertion or lying down. He also noted mild swelling in the right leg. There was no fever, cough, or chest discomfort. The temporal temperature was 35.8\u00b0C, the blood pressure 156/74 mm Hg, the heart rate 81 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 99% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He appeared fatigued. The lungs were clear on auscultation; there was a systolic murmur. Trace edema was present in the right leg. The high-sensitivity troponin level was 24 ng per liter (reference range, 0 to 14), and the N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was 1105 pg per milliliter (reference range, 0 to 1800). Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus types A and B were negative. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Ryan Chung: Computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography was negative for pulmonary emboli but showed bilateral subpleural clustered nodules and tree-in-bud opacities, as well as ground-glass and reticular opacities at the lung bases. The right atrium and right ventricle were dilated.\nDr. Ada C. Stefanescu Schmidt: Myocardial perfu-\nsion imaging, performed after  the  administra- tion of intravenous regadenoson, revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 75%. There was no evidence of ischemia or infarction. Dr. Winford: The patient was discharged home with  instructions  to  follow  up  in  the  primary\ncare clinic.\nDuring the 2 weeks after hospital discharge, shortness of breath persisted. On the day of the current admission, the patient was unable to walk even a few steps because of his shortness of breath. He returned to the primary care clinic\n \nof the other hospital for evaluation. The oxygen saturation was 78% while he was breathing am- bient air. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula, and he was brought to the emergency department of this hospital.\nThe patient reported that the shortness of breath had worsened such that he used hiking poles to walk to the bathroom and sometimes used a wheelchair. The review of systems was notable for weight loss of 11 kg during the past 3 months, intermittent dizziness, cough that was worse when he was lying down, and diarrhea.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastro- esophageal reflux disease, depression, migraines, spinal stenosis, and osteoarthritis. Medications included omeprazole, sertraline, cholecalciferol, and a fluticasone inhaler. He took oxycodone as needed for musculoskeletal pain, and he used an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. There were no known drug allergies. The patient was retired and lived in a suburban area of coastal New England with his wife and two dogs. He drank one glass of wine weekly and did not smoke tobacco or use illicit drugs. His father had died of stroke and his mother of heart disease.\nOn examination, the blood pressure was 150/73 mm Hg, the heart rate 75 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 94% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute. The body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) was 20.7. The patient appeared tired, and there were telangiectasias on his cheeks. He had dys- pnea during the conversation and needed to take short breaks between sentences. He had an ele- vated jugular venous pressure with a prominent c-v wave; Kussmaul\u2019s sign was absent. Crackles were heard at both lung bases, and there was no wheezing. There was a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, which was heard best at the left lower sternal border, as well as a soft diastolic mur- mur. The abdomen was nontender on palpation, and the liver was pulsatile. There was 1+ edema in both legs. The NT-proBNP level was 1788 pg per milliliter. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Stefanescu Schmidt: An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a right bundle- branch block. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (Fig. 1; and Videos 1, 2, and 3, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)  revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 68%. The right ventricle was dilated, and the interventricular septum was f lattened; these findings are consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The tricuspid valve, particu- larly the septal leaflet, was thickened and re- tracted and had restricted motion. There was resultant severe tricuspid regurgitation with a large coaptation gap; the jet was directed pre- dominantly toward the atrial septum. The pul- monic valve was thickened, with at least moder- ate pulmonic regurgitation. The mitral and aortic valves were mildly thickened, without clinically significant stenosis or regurgitation. The right atrium was dilated, and there was a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with right-to-left shunting on color Doppler imaging. The right ventricular systolic pressure was estimated to be 30 mm Hg.\nDr. Winford: Intravenous furosemide was administered. The patient was admitted to the hospital.\n\nTable 1.

The tricuspid valve, particularly the septal leaflet, is thickened and retracted (Panel A, oval). There is resultant severe tricuspid regurgitation (Panel B, arrow) with a large coaptation gap (Panel B, line with stars). The pulmonic valve is also thickened (Panel C). Addi\u2011 tional images were obtained in the apical four\u2011chamber view (Panels D and E). The anterior and septal leaflets of the tricuspid valve are thickened (Panel D, oval), and tricuspid regurgitation is present, with the jet directed eccentrically and medially (Panel E). A continuous\u2011wave Doppler profile (Panel F) shows a short pressure half\u2011time (<100 msec), a finding suggestive of moderate\u2011to\u2011severe pulmonic regurgitation.\n",

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sushil Allen Luis: This 86-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of progressive shortness of breath and hypoxemia. He  was  found to have tricuspid and pulmonic valvular disease and a PFO with right-to-left shunting.\n\nPulmonary Embolism\nWhen the patient presented to the emergency department 3 weeks before the current admis- sion, he had shortness of breath that had pro- gressed after recent surgery, swelling in the right leg, and an elevated d-dimer level. This clinical presentation is suggestive of pulmonary embolism. Although an elevated d-dimer level is traditionally associated with thromboembolism, there are numerous other causes, including in- flammation, surgery, and trauma. In this pa- tient, the risk of pulmonary embolism would have been evaluated with a validated scoring system (e.g., the Wells score).1 The unilateral leg swelling would have been interpreted as a pos- sible clinical sign of deep-vein thrombosis. In addition, the overall clinical context would have suggested that other diagnoses were less likely than pulmonary embolism. Therefore, the prob- ability of pulmonary embolism was high. CT pulmonary angiography was appropriately pur- sued to rule out this diagnosis.\n\nPulmonary Diseases\nAlthough CT pulmonary angiography ruled out pulmonary emboli, bilateral subpleural clustered nodules and tree-in-bud opacities were identi- fied, along with ground-glass and reticular opacities at the lung bases. Subpleural nodules are typically inflammatory, and ground-glass and reticular opacities are nonspecific findings. Tree-in-bud opacities may suggest infection (e.g., tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial disease, as- pergillosis, aspiration pneumonia, or viral bron- chiolitis), congenital disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis or Kartagener\u2019s syndrome), or bronchovascular infiltration (e.g., sarcoidosis or lymphoma). This patient did not have radiologically significant consolidation or bronchiectasis, so pulmonary infection and congenital disease are unlikely. In addition, he had only a solitary 12-mm subcari- nal lymph node, so sarcoidosis and lymphoma are also unlikely.\nAcute Coronary Syndrome and Left Ventricular Heart Failure\nGiven the patient\u2019s progressive shortness of breath that was worse with exertion or lying down, myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure should be considered. Myocardial infarc- tion is unlikely because the patient had only mild elevation of the high-sensitivity troponin level and did not have evidence of ischemia or infarction on myocardial perfusion imaging. In addition, left ventricular failure is unlikely be- cause he did not have evidence of pulmonary edema on CT pulmonary angiography.\n\nPlatypnea\u2013Orthodeoxia Syndrome\nThe patient had shortness of breath and cough that was worse with lying down, as well as hy- poxemia that was readily reversed with the ad- ministration of supplemental oxygen. When dyspnea is affected by changes in position, platypnea\u2013orthodeoxia syndrome should be con- sidered. This syndrome is characterized by shortness of breath (platypnea) and hypoxemia (orthodeoxia), which typically occur when the patient is upright and abate when the patient is in the recumbent position. Other patterns of positional dyspnea may be observed, as was the case in this patient. Platypnea\u2013orthodeoxia syn- drome may be attributable to pulmonary or cardiac causes.\nPulmonary causes of platypnea\u2013orthodeoxia syndrome include pulmonary arteriovenous mal- formations, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and parenchymal lung disease. CT pulmonary angi- ography did not show arteriovenous malforma- tions or radiologically significant parenchymal disease, and laboratory evaluation did not show hepatic dysfunction. Therefore, platypnea\u2013ortho- deoxia syndrome due to a pulmonary cause is unlikely.\nCardiac causes of platypnea\u2013orthodeoxia syn- drome are associated with the coexistence of an interatrial shunt and elevated right atrial pres- sure. Anatomical defects that can result in an interatrial shunt include a PFO and atrial septal defects. Elevated right atrial pressure may de- velop in the context of pulmonary hypertension, severe tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular failure, constrictive pericarditis, or pericardial effusion. In this patient, TTE showed severe tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial dilatation, and a PFO with right-to-left shunting. These findings are consistent with platypnea\u2013orthode- oxia syndrome due to a cardiac cause, which was probably the cause of oxygen desaturation.\n\nTricuspid Regurgitation and Pulmonic Stenosis\nThe patient had several notable findings on physical examination, including an elevated jug- ular venous pressure with a prominent c-v wave, a pulsatile liver, and swelling in both legs. These findings are consistent with severe tricuspid re- gurgitation; a pulsatile liver is most likely to be observed in the presence of volume overload. The diagnosis of severe tricuspid regurgitation on physical examination is typically based on these peripheral signs, because the murmur is frequently inaudible. Severe tricuspid regurgita- tion may be associated with low-velocity, lami- nar flow between the right ventricle and the right atrium, with the absence of turbulence re- sulting in an inaudible murmur.\nTherefore, the presence of an audible systolic murmur is unusual in the context of severe tri- cuspid regurgitation alone, and alternative causes must be sought to explain the systolic murmur observed in this case. Heart disease involving the valves on the left side is the most common cause of audible systolic murmurs. This patient had a normal carotid upstroke and a normal second (S2) heart sound, findings that are not suggestive of clinically significant aortic steno- sis. He had a normal first (S1) heart sound, which is not consistent with clinically signifi- cant mitral regurgitation. The absence of reverse splitting of S2 makes hypertrophic cardiomyopa- thy unlikely. Therefore, pulmonic stenosis should be considered as a possible cause of this patient\u2019s systolic murmur, although it is uncommon.\nCarcinoid Heart Disease\nTTE showed that the tricuspid and pulmonic valves had leaflet thickening with immobility. In the absence of congenital heart disease, the co- existence of severe tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonic stenosis is unusual and suggests the possibility of either carcinoid or drug-induced valvular heart disease.\nCarcinoid tumors are rare secretory neuroen- docrine tumors that typically arise in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. These tumors secrete vasoactive compounds \u2014 including serotonin, histamine, tachykinins, kallikreins, and prostaglandins \u2014 into the systemic circulation, which leads to carcinoid syndrome. Features of carci- noid syndrome include facial flushing, broncho- spasm, diarrhea, and telangiectasias; diarrhea and telangiectasias were seen in this patient. Carcinoid heart disease occurs when exposure of cardiac valvular tissues to circulating vasoactive hormones, particularly serotonin, results in val- vular leaflet fibrosis, thickening, and retraction. In patients with carcinoid heart disease, involve- ment of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves is common.2 Involvement of the mitral and aortic valves occurs in less than half these patients and is typically associated with the presence of a PFO.2,3\nTo rule out drug-induced valvular heart dis- ease, it is important to obtain a detailed list of current and past medications. Culprit drugs in- clude ergot derivatives used for migraines (ergota- mine and methysergide) or Parkinson\u2019s disease (pergolide and cabergoline), as well as anorectic drugs (fenfluramine and phentermine).4,5 Drug- induced valvular heart disease is very similar to carcinoid heart disease; however, carcinoid heart disease has a predilection for valves on the right side, whereas drug-induced disease can involve valves on both sides.4,5 This patient was not tak- ing any of the medications that are typically as- sociated with drug-induced valvular heart disease. Overall, the appearance of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves on TTE and the presence of hypoxemia that could be due to right-to-left shunting through a PFO, along with the weight loss, telangiectasias, and diarrhea, make carci- noid heart disease due to a neuroendocrine tu- mor (carcinoid tumor) associated with carcinoid syndrome the most likely diagnosis in this pa- tient. A review of previously obtained abdominal imaging studies, including images of the upper abdomen from CT pulmonary angiography and images in the subcostal view from TTE, could reveal the presence of hepatic metastases. To evaluate the patient for carcinoid syndrome, I would obtain the level of 5-hydroxyindoleace- tic acid (5-HIAA) in urine, which would be\nelevated.\n\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Chung: A review of upper abdominal images obtained during CT pulmonary angiography re- vealed a hepatic lesion. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without the  administra-  tion of intravenous contrast material. A hetero- geneously attenuating mass, measuring 10.0 cm in diameter,  was  detected  in  hepatic  segments  7 and 8 (Fig. 3A). An enlarged, partially calcified mesenteric lymph node, measuring 2.4 cm in diameter, was also present. These findings were suggestive of either a primary tumor or meta-  static disease in the liver. Subsequent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, performed before and after the administration of intravenous con- trast material, showed a hepatic mass with het- erogeneous signal intensity. The  mass  had  areas of cystic and necrotic changes (Fig. 3B) and hemorrhage (Fig. 3C). Late arterial  phase  imag- ing showed a thickened rind of  peripheral  arte- rial enhancement without washout or a capsule appearance (Fig. 3D).\nGiven the clinical suspicion for a metastatic\nneuroendocrine tumor, whole-body positron- emission tomography (PET)\u2013CT with DOTATATE (68Ga-labeled 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane\u2013 1,4,7,10-tetraaccetic acid\u2013octreotate) was per- formed to identify the primary site and extent of disease. There was abnormal intense radiotracer uptake in the mass involving the right hepatic lobe and in a smaller mass involving the caudate lobe (Fig. 3E). There were also clustered foci of abnormal radiotracer uptake along the midline of the lower abdomen that corresponded to an enhancing, eccentric small-bowel mass, measur- ing 1.8 cm in diameter, and an adjacent en- larged, partially calcified lymph node (Fig. 3F). No other sites of abnormal radiotracer uptake were identified. These findings were compatible with a small-bowel neuroendocrine tumor with lymph-node and hepatic metastases.\n",
