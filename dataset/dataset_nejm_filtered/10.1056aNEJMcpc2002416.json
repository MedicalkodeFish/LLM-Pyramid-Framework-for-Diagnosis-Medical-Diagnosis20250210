    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Naomi J. Serling-Boyd (Medicine): A 48-year-old man was evaluated at this hospi- tal because of transient vision loss.\nThe patient had been in his usual state of good health until 1 hour before evaluation, when he noticed white \u201csparkles\u201d flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness. He had no floaters or eye pain. During the next 2 minutes, the blurry vision worsened and became \u201cdark,\u201d such that the patient could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He pre- sented to this hospital for evaluation, arriving 1 hour after the onset of vision symptoms.\nOn presentation, the patient noted that the vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. The temperature was 36.7\u00b0C, the blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, the heart rate 92 beats per minute, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilo- grams divided by the square of the height in meters) 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and was limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye; 2 hours later, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/40 for distance vision and 20/30 with correction for near vision. Results of the Ishihara color test were normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact; visual fields were full in response to confrontation. Intraocular pressure and results of a slit-lamp examination of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye were normal bilaterally. There was se- vere ptosis of the left upper eyelid (margin reflex distance, 4 mm in the right eye and 1 mm in the left eye). A dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels. A nontender, irregular mass was palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but there was no proptosis. The temporal arteries were prominent bilaterally, more so on the right side than on the left side, with normal pulsations and no tenderness. There was no tenderness of the scalp or temporo- mandibular joints. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.\nA review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. There was a 2-month history of bilat- eral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. There was a sensation of locking when flexing or extending the right first finger. Two days before evaluation, the patient had a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He re- ported no numbness or weakness.\nThe patient had a history of presbyopia. He had not undergone any surgeries, was not cur- rently taking any medications, and had no known allergies. He was born and raised in a country in Eurasia and had lived in the United States for 20 years. He traveled internationally for his work as a university professor. He was divorced and lived with his two children in a house in New England. He had smoked a half pack of ciga- rettes for 5 years but had quit smoking 20 years earlier. He drank alcohol rarely and did not use illicit drugs. His parents were alive and well, both of his grandmothers had had breast cancer, and there was no family history of ocular or autoimmune disease.\nLaboratory evaluation revealed normocytic\nanemia and elevated levels of alanine amino- transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and al- kaline phosphatase. Results of tests of kidney and thyroid function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, glucose, glycated hemoglobin, creatine kinase, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a). Testing for antinuclear antibodies was negative, and levels of IgG subclasses were normal. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Aspirin was administered, along with empirical treatment with intravenous methylpred- nisolone, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.\nDr. Hillary R. Kelly: Magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) of the head and orbits (Fig. 1), per- formed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed enlarge- ment of the right medial rectus muscle with stranding of the adjacent extraconal fat, as well as an enhancing masslike lesion in the left ante- rior superior orbit, abutting the left lacrimal gland. The masslike lesion showed a hypointense signal on short-tau inversion recovery imaging. The brain parenchyma was normal. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, as was ultrasonography of the tem- poral arteries. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed markedly heterogeneous liver paren- chyma and an enlarged periportal lymph node, measuring 2 cm in largest dimension. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (Fig. 1), performed after the administra- tion of intravenous contrast material, revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver and hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, as well as diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications. There was a prominent right hilar lymph node, measuring 10 mm in diameter. The lung parenchyma was unremarkable.\nDr. Serling-Boyd: On the second hospital day, diplopia occurred when the patient looked to the far right. On examination, there was mild limi- tation of abduction of the right eye. After a second dose of intravenous methylprednisolone was administered, the patient chose to leave the hospital against medical advice. After discharge, he took prednisone daily. During the next week, additional laboratory test results became avail- able. Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic anti- bodies (ANCAs) was negative. Blood testing for blastomyces antigen, coccidioides antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies was negative, as was an interferon-\u03b3 release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nTable 1.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Sebastian H. Unizony: This patient has several clinical manifestations that raise concern about giant-cell arteritis (Fig. 2), even if he is younger than the typical patient presenting with this disease. These manifestations include acute vision loss, new onset of headache, mandibular pain with mastication (also referred to as jaw claudi- cation), diplopia, and constitutional symptoms.1 In addition, the physical examination is notable for prominent temporal arteries, a finding that is sometimes seen in patients with giant-cell arteritis, and the laboratory evaluation is notable for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, abnormalities that are present in nearly 95% of patients with giant-cell arteritis before glucocorticoids are administered.\nIn this case, after the treating physicians en- countered a clinical syndrome compatible with giant-cell arteritis with the knowledge that irre- versible blindness occurs in up to 20% of pa- tients with this disease (nearly always before the diagnosis is confirmed),1 they appropriately ini- tiated glucocorticoid therapy without delay, be- fore the workup was complete. However, several features of this patient\u2019s presentation are not consistent with giant-cell arteritis (Fig. 2), trig- gering suspicion for conditions that mimic this diagnosis.3 He has orbital abnormalities, includ- ing mass effect due to left dacryoadenitis, as well as enlargement of the right medial rectus mus- cle, which probably explains his diplopia. In addi- tion, he has enlarged, calcified lymph nodes in the abdomen and a prominent lymph node in the chest. Blood tests show substantial elevation of levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and aminotransferases. Finally, imaging studies of the liver show heterogeneous parenchyma with diffuse punctate calcifications and hypoattenua- tion of the right lobe, findings that are sugges- tive of an infiltrative process.\nDiseases Mimicking Giant-Cell Arteritis\nMy differential diagnosis for this constellation of clinical manifestations \u2014 including cranial symptoms resembling giant-cell arteritis, dacryo- adenitis, extraocular muscle enlargement, lymph- adenopathies, and liver infiltration \u2014 includes sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, and primary amyloidosis. Vasculitides involving small and medium vessels (e.g., polyarteritis nodosa and ANCA-associated vasculitis) sometimes affect the head and neck arteries and can be confounded with giant-cell arteritis.3 However, these vasculi- tides do not usually involve the liver parenchyma or the lymph nodes. In addition, patients with these vasculitides commonly have other clinical manifestations (e.g., cutaneous, otorhinolaryn- gologic, pulmonary, peripheral nerve, or renal manifestations) that facilitate disease recogni- tion, and these findings are absent in this case. Furthermore, 40 to 90% of patients with ANCA- associated vasculitis have a positive ANCA test, and testing for ANCAs was negative in this case. Tuberculosis and endemic mycosis (e.g., histo- plasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomyco- sis) can involve the liver and lymph nodes and can be associated with some of the imaging features observed in this patient. However, these\n \ninfections do not cause symptoms consistent with giant-cell arteritis, and corresponding mi- crobiologic tests were negative in this case.\n\nSarcoidosis\nSarcoidosis is an immune-mediated disorder of unknown cause that can affect all racial groups. It can occur anytime in adulthood but usually develops before 50 years of age. The disease is characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation that can involve any organ.4 Ap- proximately 90% of patients present with intra- thoracic abnormalities such as hilar lymphade- nopathy and interstitial lung disease.5 In approximately 30% of cases, extrathoracic man- ifestations occur, most commonly involving the joints (e.g., arthralgias), the eyes (e.g., uveitis), and the skin (e.g., erythema nodosum).5 Consti- tutional symptoms are frequently reported. Sar- coidosis can also affect the central and periph- eral nervous system, extraocular orbital structures (e.g., lacrimal glands and extraocular muscles), liver, spleen, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kid- neys, and calcium metabolism.5 In rare cases, sarcoidosis can be complicated by systemic vascu- litis affecting small, medium, or large vessels.6 In fact, sarcoidosis-associated vasculitis involving the extracranial arteries (e.g., temporal arteries) with resultant headache and jaw claudication has been reported.7-9\nThis patient could have sarcoidosis with  an atypical presentation that mimics giant-cell arte- ritis, in addition to infiltration of the lacrimal glands, extraocular muscles, lymph nodes, and liver. Autopsy studies have shown that liver in- volvement occurs in most patients with sarcoidosis but becomes clinically significant in ap- proximately 10 to 30% of patients.10 Hepatitis associated with sarcoidosis sometimes causes parenchymal hypoattenuation and leads to dys- trophic calcification, findings that are seen in this patient. Arguing against the possibility of sarcoidosis, however, is the fact that this patient has a single prominent right hilar lymph node measuring 10 mm in diameter; in patients with sarcoidosis, hilar lymphadenopathy tends to be associated with larger, multiple, and bilateral lymph nodes.4 Measurement of angiotensin- converting enzyme and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels could be helpful in this case; elevated levels would support but not confirm the diag- nosis of sarcoidosis. The most appropriate confirmatory test would be a tissue biopsy (e.g., lymph node, lacrimal gland, or liver biopsy), with the specimen showing noncaseating granulomas.\n\nIgG4-Related Disease\nIgG4-related disease is a multisystem fibroin- f lammatory disease that has been increasingly recognized over the past decade.11 Men are af- fected more frequently than women, and the age at onset is typically between 50 and 60 years. Lesions associated with IgG4-related disease are characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and storiform fibrosis.11 The most commonly affected organs are the pancreas (i.e., autoim- mune pancreatitis type 1), the hepatobiliary sys- tem (e.g., sclerosing cholangitis), and the salivary and lacrimal glands.12 Other possible manifesta- tions include lymphadenitis, dermatitis, thyroid- itis, pachymeningitis, hypophysitis, pericarditis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, lung parenchymal masses, orbital pseudotumor formation, and extraocular muscle involvement.12 Vasculitis such as aortitis with periaortitis, sometimes concur- rent with retroperitoneal fibrosis, is another potential manifestation of IgG4-related disease,13 and temporal arteritis has been reported occa- sionally.14,15\nPatients with IgG4-related disease present\nwith synchronous involvement of three organs, on average. The main clinical phenotypes of or- gan involvement are hepatopancreatobiliary dis- ease, retroperitoneal fibrosis or aortitis, disease limited to the head and neck, and classic Miku- licz syndrome with systemic features.16 Patients with disease limited to the head and neck or with classic Mikulicz syndrome with systemic features tend to have the highest serum IgG4 levels and frequently have inflammation of the lacrimal glands (in 50 to 60% of cases), salivary glands (50 to 80%), and lymph nodes (30 to 70%); however, these two clinical phenotypes are not frequently associated with involvement of the liver (in <5% of cases) or biliary tree (1 to 30%).16 Although this patient could have an uncom- mon form of IgG4-related disease, several fea- tures of his presentation are not consistent with this diagnosis. First, patients with IgG4-related disease tend to have inflammation of both the lacrimal glands and the salivary glands bilater- ally,11,16,17 whereas this patient has unilateral lacrimal gland enlargement and no obvious sali- vary gland disease. Second, many patients with IgG4-related disease have pancreatic involve- ment,11,16 which is absent in this patient. Third, most patients with IgG4-related disease have normal serum inflammatory marker levels and increased serum IgG4 levels (>135 mg per deci- liter),18 especially in the presence of multiorgan disease and infiltration of exocrine glands, and these laboratory findings are absent in this pa- tient. Fourth, this patient has lymph node and liver calcifications, which are not commonly observed in patients with IgG4-related disease. Finally, reports of IgG4-related disease with cra- nial manifestations that mimic giant-cell arteri- tis are rare.\n\nSystemic Amyloidosis\nSystemic amyloidosis is a rare disease that re- sults from protein misfolding and aggregation into highly ordered fibrils that deposit in tissues and cause progressive organ damage. Amyloido- sis can occur in the presence of an abnormal protein (e.g., primary amyloidosis, also known as amyloid light-chain [AL] amyloidosis), in as- sociation with excess abundance of a normal protein (e.g., secondary amyloidosis, also known as amyloid A [AA] amyloidosis), and for unclear reasons (e.g., senile systemic amyloidosis).19\nPrimary amyloidosis is a plasma-cell dyscra- sia caused by deposition of protein fragments derived from abnormal immunoglobulin light chains.19 The mean age at diagnosis is 63 years, and men are affected more often than women.19 In most patients with primary amyloidosis, the amyloidogenic light chains are produced by low- level expansion of an indolent B-cell clone that arises in the context of monoclonal gammopa- thy of undetermined significance. In some pa- tients, the disease occurs in association with multiple myeloma, Waldenstr\u00f6m\u2019s macroglobu- linemia, or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The most frequently affected organs are the kidneys (lead- ing to nephrotic proteinuria) and the heart (causing pump failure). Patients may also have peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, joint and soft-tissue infiltration (e.g., extraocular muscle enlargement),20 deposits in the lacrimal glands21 and salivary glands, gastrointestinal dysmotility, skin lesions (e.g., papules and ecchymosis), lymphadenopathy,22 splenomegaly, liver disease, respiratory manifestations (e.g., lung nodules), and bleeding diathesis.19 Liver involvement, which occurs in approximately 20 to 30% of cases of primary amyloidosis,23 may manifest as elevated aminotransferase levels, cholestasis, and hepato- megaly. CT of the liver may show areas of paren- chymal hypoattenuation in patients with clinical- ly significant amyloid deposition.24 Furthermore, amyloid fibrils have an affinity for calcium, and imaging studies can show calcified deposits in different organs, including the liver24 and lymph nodes,25 findings similar to those seen in this patient.\nPrimary amyloidosis can affect any organ, including the arteries, except for the brain. In fact, several cases of primary amyloidosis with cranial features similar to those of giant-cell arteritis have been reported.20,26-31 The diagnosis of primary amyloidosis may well explain this patient\u2019s constellation of clinical manifestations, including the liver involvement with character- istic findings on imaging (parenchymal hypoattenuation and calcification), lymphadenopathy, lacrimal gland involvement, extraocular muscle enlargement, and a syndrome resembling giant- cell arteritis, with prominent temporal arteries, temporal headache, jaw claudication, and transient vision loss. In cases of amyloidosis mim- icking giant-cell arteritis, vision loss is presumably caused by transient or permanent occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries or the retinal arteries.20,29,32  In addition, this patient reports lateral hip soreness and symptoms suggestive of stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) of the right first finger, which could be caused by amyloid infiltration in soft tissues. Finally, the increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is disproportionate to the increase in the C-reactive protein level, a finding that perhaps reflects the presence of paraproteinemia, which is seen in more than 90% of patients with primary amy- loidosis.\nThe diagnosis of amyloidosis requires the identification of amyloid fibrils in tissue. On microscopic examination, these fibrils show a pathognomonic apple-green birefringence under polarized light after Congo red staining.19 To establish the diagnosis in this case, I would recommend performing immunoelectrophoresis and quantifying free light chains in blood and urine to look for a monoclonal component, and most important, performing a biopsy to confirm the presence of amyloid deposits. A fat-pad bi- opsy is simple to perform and has a relatively high yield for the diagnosis of systemic primary amyloidosis. Other tissues that could be sampled in this patient include the rectal or lip mucosa, left lacrimal gland, temporal arteries, liver, and abdominal lymph nodes. Because amyloidosis is often associated with hemostatic defects, less invasive procedures are generally recommended as an initial diagnostic approach. If amyloid material is identified, the next steps are to deter- mine the type of amyloid with the use of im- munohistochemical studies or laser-capture mi- crodissection followed by mass spectrometry, as well as to assess the extent and severity of the disease.19 Where available, imaging with radioio- dinated serum amyloid P component can be used to measure the burden of disease and monitor the response to treatment.33 If the diag- nosis of primary amyloidosis is confirmed in this patient, I would also recommend a bone marrow biopsy to rule out multiple myeloma, which occurs in 10 to 15% of patients with pri- mary amyloidosis.\n",

    "Key testing result": "Dr. Sam Sadigh: The diagnostic tests in this case were biopsies of a retroperitoneal lymph node and the liver. Histologic examination of the retro- peritoneal lymph node revealed fragments of fi- broadipose tissue with calcifications and acellular eosinophilic deposits in areas with cracking arti- fact (Fig. 3A). Associated scattered multinucle- ated giant cells and reactive osseous metaplasia were present. No identifiable lymph node tissue was seen. On Congo red staining, the eosino- philic deposits showed apple-green birefringence under polarized light, a feature characteristic of amyloid (Fig. 3B).\nHistologic examination of the liver specimen\nrevealed predominantly portal-based, well-delin- eated nodules of similar eosinophilic deposits (Fig. 3C), which were consistent with amyloid (Fig. 3D). Foci adjacent to the amyloid deposits in the liver contained a cellular infiltrate with small but dense clusters of mature-appearing plasma cells (Fig. 3E). On immunohistochemical staining for kappa and lambda light chains, the plasma cells showed kappa restriction (Fig. 3F and 3G), which indicated the presence of a plasma-cell neoplasm associated with the paren- chymal amyloid deposition.\nEven in patients with a plasma-cell neoplasm, it is still essential to characterize the type of amyloid, since secondary or familial amyloidosis may be present incidentally. Laser-capture micro- dissection of the amyloid in a tissue biopsy specimen and analysis by means of mass spec- trometry is the most sensitive and specific method of subtyping amyloid. In this case, a section of the biopsy specimen of the retroperi- toneal lymph node was analyzed by means of liquid chromatography with tandem mass spec- trometry, which showed a peptide pattern con- sistent with kappa immunoglobulin light-chain amyloid.\nA bone marrow biopsy was performed as part of the workup for potential plasma-cell myeloma. Examination of a core biopsy specimen revealed mildly hypocellular marrow with maturing tri- lineage hematopoiesis (Fig. 4A and 4B). How- ever, scattered and clustered plasma cells were present that showed kappa restriction on kappa and lambda light-chain mRNA in situ hybridiza- tion (Fig. 4C and 4D). On immunohistochemical staining for CD138, the plasma cells accounted for approximately 10% of the marrow cellularity (approximately 5% of the intertrabecular mar- row space). Congo red staining was negative for amyloid deposits in the marrow.\nIn bone marrow aspirate, plasma cells ac- counted for 8.5% of the marrow cellularity on a differential count (Fig. 4E). On flow cytometry of the aspirate, plasma cells accounted for 3.7% of all viable events and revealed the following immunophenotype: CD45dim CD138+ CD38+ CD19dim/\u2212  CD27+  CD56\u2212  with  expression  of monotypic cytoplasmic kappa immunoglobulin light chain (Fig. 4F). Cytogenetic studies and fluorescence in situ hybridization of the bone marrow revealed a normal male karyotype (46,XY[20]); however, the translocation t(11;14) was identified, reflecting fusion of the CCND1 and IGH loci. Although early studies suggested that the presence of this translocation at diagno- sis might be associated with a favorable progno- sis in patients with multiple myeloma, its presence may be prognostically adverse in patients with primary amyloidosis.34-36 The overall find- ing of monotypic plasma cells in the bone mar- row in the presence of light-chain amyloid in lymph node and liver specimens on mass spec- trometry confirmed the diagnosis of systemic primary amyloidosis.\n\nFigure 3. Biopsy Specimens of a Lymph Node and the Liver.\nHematoxylin and eosin staining of a biopsy specimen of a retroperitoneal lymph node (Panel A) shows fragments of fibroadipose tissue with calcifications and acellular eosinophilic deposits (arrows), with associated reactive osseous metaplasia (left arrowhead) and scattered multinucleated giant cells (right arrowhead). On Congo red staining (Panel B), the eosinophilic deposits show apple\u2011green birefringence under polarized light, a feature characteristic of amyloid.

At higher magnification (Panel E), there is a focal dense cluster of plasma cells adjacent to the amyloid deposits in the liver parenchyma. On immunohistochemical staining for kappa and lambda light chains (Panels F and G, respectively), the plasma cells show kappa restriction \n\nFigure 4.
