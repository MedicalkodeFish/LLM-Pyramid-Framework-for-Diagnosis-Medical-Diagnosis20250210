    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. Ryan J. Sullivan: A 64-year-old man presented to this hospital for evaluation of a mass in the left frontal and left parietal lobes.\nFour weeks before this presentation, while residing at his home in Florida, the patient began to have clumsiness of the right upper arm, as well as difficulty writ- ing his name, holding a toothbrush, and coordinating activities with his right hand. Two weeks later, the symptoms in the right hand persisted, and the patient presented to his primary care doctor near his home for evaluation. Computed to- mography (CT) of the head, performed without the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed an amorphous hypodensity in the left frontal lobe with associated mild local mass effect. Treatment with oral dexamethasone was initi- ated, but the patient\u2019s symptoms did not resolve. He and his wife subsequently traveled to Boston, and he presented to the emergency department of this hospital for further evaluation and care.\nAt the emergency department, the patient reported 4 weeks of clumsiness and weakness of the right arm. He had no other symptoms. He had a history of mela- noma of the left shoulder and had undergone excision of the affected tissue at another hospital 4 years before this evaluation; a lymph node biopsy had report- edly been negative, and no additional therapy had been administered. Medications included dexamethasone. There were no known drug allergies. He had smoked a few cigars per week for the past 10 years and did not consume alcohol or use il- licit drugs. He worked as an executive and lived with his wife, splitting time be- tween Florida and the New England area, where they were renovating their home. He had no known sick contacts. His mother had died of colon cancer at 72 years of age; his father had died of an unknown cause when he was in his 30s.\nOn examination, the temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the blood pressure 158/95 mm Hg, the pulse 90 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while the patient was breathing ambient air. Movements of the right hand and fingers were slower and less precise than those of the left hand and fingers. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Florian J. Fintelmann: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head was performed be- fore and after the administration of intravenous contrast material. An axial T1-weighted image obtained without contrast enhancement showed focal hyperintensity in the left frontal lobe, which corresponded to a ring-enhancing lesion surrounded by edema (Fig. 1A through 1C). CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a solid, noncalcified nodule in the right upper lung that measured 2.2 cm in diameter (Fig. 1D).\nDr. Sullivan: CT-guided fine-needle aspiration of the nodule in the right lung revealed malig- nant cells consistent with metastatic melanoma. Eleven days later, the brain lesion was resected, and pathological examination of the tissue re- vealed a malignant tumor consistent with meta- static melanoma. Treatment with dexamethasone, levetiracetam, and omeprazole was started.\nOne week after the resection procedure, the patient was evaluated at the melanoma center of this hospital. During the next 2 months, he re- ceived adjuvant radiation therapy to the cranial resection cavity. The dose of dexamethasone was tapered, and treatment with ipilimumab plus nivolumab was initiated.\nFive days after initiation of the second cycle of ipilimumab plus nivolumab therapy (25 days after the initiation of the first cycle of therapy and 3 months after the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma), shortness of breath, cough, and fe- ver developed. The patient presented to the emer- gency department of this hospital.\nOn examination, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C, the  blood  pressure  108/47  mm  Hg,  the  pulse 92 beats per minute, and the oxygen saturation 48% while the patient was breathing ambient air. He was alert and awake, with no signs of respiratory distress. Examination of the lungs revealed crackles in both bases. The remainder of the examination was normal. Oxygen was ad- ministered through a nonrebreather face mask, and imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Fintelmann: A chest radiograph showed low lung volumes, new diffuse interstitial opacities, and bilateral hilar fullness (Fig. 2A). CT of the chest ruled out pulmonary embolism and re- vealed diffuse ground-glass opacities, interlobu- lar septal thickening, and mild traction bron- chiectasis (Fig. 2B). These findings were new relative to the baseline staging studies obtained 3 months earlier.\nDr. Sullivan: The results of blood tests of renal and liver function were normal; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was admitted to the oncology service in this hospital. Nucleic acid testing for influenza A and B viruses was negative, as were tests of a naso- pharyngeal swab for adenovirus, metapneumo- virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainflu- enza virus types 1, 2, and 3 antigens. A sputum culture and smear, a mycobacterial culture and smear, and an induced-sputum specimen to test for Pneumocystis jirovecii were obtained.\n\nFigure 1. MRI of the Head and CT Scan of the Chest, Obtained during the Initial Presentation.\nAxial T1\u2011weighted images of the head, obtained before and after the administration of contrast material (Panels A and B, respectively), show an intrinsically hyperintense lesion (Panel A, arrow), measuring 1.8 cm in diameter, in the left prefrontal gyrus, with visible ring enhancement (Panel B, arrow). An axial fluid\u2011attenuated inversion recovery image of the head (Panel C) shows the lesion surrounded by edema (arrow). An axial CT image of the chest (Panel D) shows a solid, noncalcified nodule (arrow), measuring 2.2 cm in diameter, in the right upper lobe; no other pulmonary nodules were noted.\n\nFigure 2.

    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Kerry L. Reynolds: I was involved in the care of this patient and am aware of the diagnosis. This 64-year-old man with metastatic melanoma pre- sented to the emergency department of this hospital with fever, cough, and profound hypox- emia 25 days after beginning combination treat- ment with the immune checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab.\nHypoxemia and Bilateral Airspace Opacities \nWhat is the cause of this patient\u2019s striking de- gree of hypoxemia and bilateral airspace opaci- ties? Both the underlying metastatic melanoma and the receipt of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy are important factors to consider in con- structing a differential diagnosis. The most likely cause of this patient\u2019s presentation was thought to be pulmonary complications related to im- mune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, but a broad differential diagnosis was considered. Diffuse opacities can represent lymphangitic spread of melanoma, although such a conclusion would indicate that a rapid progression of disease had occurred only weeks after the initial 2.2-cm nod- ule in the lung was noted. However, the occur- rence of rapidly progressive disease after the start of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy has been described.1 Another possibility is that the opacities represent diffuse alveolar hemor- rhage, although such an event rarely occurs after administration of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Myocarditis, another complication of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, could lead to congestive heart failure and pulmonary ede- ma2; however, this patient had no other signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n \nGiven the presence of fever, infection was considered. However, the patient had no other signs or symptoms of infection, had no sick contacts, had a normal white-cell count, and had negative tests for multiple infectious pathogens.\n\nToxic Effects Resulting from Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy\nWhy would toxic effects associated with immu- notherapy develop in this patient? The immune checkpoint inhibitors used to treat melanoma in this patient promote antitumor response by in- hibiting the protein receptors, which normally dampen the inflammatory cascade precipitated when a T cell is presented an antigen that is recognized as foreign, such as an antigen pro- duced by a cancer cell. Thus, in this patient, treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors resulted in activation of the immune response to recognize and target his cancer. However, the resulting activated immune cells can fail to dis- tinguish between cancer cells and normal cells, which can result in autoimmune conditions that require immunosuppressive treatment. For this reason, an autoimmune toxic effect must be considered, and, if suspected, treatment should be administered immediately.\nThis patient\u2019s severe hypoxemia and diffuse\ninflammation of the lung are consistent with pneumonitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which can be severe in nearly one fourth of patients.3 Pneumonitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is estimat- ed to occur in 5% of patients treated with mono- therapy but in up to 10% of patients treated with combination therapy, as was the case in this patient.3 In addition, the fact that this patient presented with pneumonitis 25 days after initia- tion of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy fits with this diagnosis; pneumonitis can manifest between 9 days and 19 months after initiation of treatment (median, 2.8 months). Earlier mani- festation occurs with combination immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.3\nImmunosuppressive therapy is the first line of treatment for autoimmune toxic effects induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors.4-7 Ultimately, pneumonitis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is a diagnosis that is made af- ter other diagnoses are ruled out. Therefore, the decision to perform a bronchoscopy or lung bi- opsy is individualized. This patient\u2019s workup for infectious diseases was negative, and his degree of hypoxemia was severe enough to warrant de- ferral of bronchoscopy.\n\n",
