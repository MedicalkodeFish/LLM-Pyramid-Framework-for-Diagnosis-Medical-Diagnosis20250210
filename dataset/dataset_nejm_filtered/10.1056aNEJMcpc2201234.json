    "Primary Symptom": "A 57-Year-Old Man\nwith Persistent Cough and Pulmonary Opacities\n",
    "Presentation of Case": "Dr. George A. Alba: A 57-year-old man was evaluated at this hospital because of per- sistent cough and pulmonary opacities.\nSix years before the current admission, the patient received a diagnosis of poly- arteritis nodosa after fevers, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and testicular pain had developed. He was treated with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, followed by main- tenance therapy with prednisone and weekly methotrexate. He was treated inter- mittently with escalating doses of prednisone because of episodic worsening of the arthralgias; the most recent such treatment was given 5 months before the current admission. At that time, owing to an exacerbation of pain associated with the arthralgias and at the direction of his physician, he increased the amount of oxycodone he had been taking. He also reported fever and weight loss. Imaging studies were obtained.\nDr. Jeanna M. Harvey Barnes: Five months before the current admission, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed after the ad- ministration of intravenous contrast material. Chest CT (Fig. 1A and 1B) revealed mild centrilobular emphysema and small pulmonary nodules that appeared un- changed from those seen on imaging that had been performed 6 years earlier. There was also diffuse thickening of the bronchial wall, layering secretions in the trachea and right main-stem bronchus, a mildly patulous esophagus, and a small hiatal hernia. There were no clinically significant findings on imaging of the ab- domen or pelvis.\nDr. Alba: A test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative. Serum protein electro- phoresis results were normal, as was the IgG level.\nThree months before the current admission, the patient had fevers and a cough productive of green sputum. The temperature was 37.3\u00b0C and the oxygen satura- tion 89% while he was breathing ambient air. Thrush was present in the orophar- ynx. Auscultation of the chest revealed crackles and wheezing in the right lung. Blood levels of electrolytes, lipase, amylase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Fig. 1C) showed patchy and confluent opacities predomi- nantly in the right mid and lower lung.\nDr. Alba: The patient was admitted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intrave- nous vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin was administered. A blood test for cryptococcal antigen and a urine test for legionella antigen were negative. A sputum culture grew normal respira- tory flora and Candida albicans; a test for Pneumo- cystis jirovecii was negative. During the next several days, fever resolved and the oxygen satu- ration and white-cell count normalized. On the fifth hospital day, the patient was discharged home to complete a 14-day course of levofloxa- cin. After he completed the course of levofloxacin, his cough and constitutional symptoms abated partially but did not return to baseline. His pri- mary care physician prescribed inhaled flutica- sone\u2013salmeterol and as-needed inhaled albuterol. Six weeks after the patient was discharged from this hospital (approximately 5 weeks be- fore the current admission), his wife began to have a nonproductive cough and rhinorrhea; several days later, the patient had similar symp- toms, along with increased production of brown sputum. He sought medical attention after awak- ening with coughing and dyspnea. The tempera- ture was 38.4\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 89% while he was breathing ambient air.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Fig. 1D) obtained 1 month before the current admission showed patchy opacities in the right upper, middle, and lower lobes.\nDr. Alba: Electrolyte levels were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney- function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. The patient was again admit- ted to this hospital, and empirical treatment with intravenous vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin; oral prednisone; and inhaled alb- uterol and ipratropium was administered. A spu- tum culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. After two days, the patient was dis- charged home to complete a 7-day course of levo- floxacin.\nOver the course of the next 3 weeks, the patient had malaise, productive cough, fever, and sweats. He stopped smoking cigarettes.\nEight days before the current admission, the patient was referred to the emergency depart- ment of this hospital for evaluation. On exami- nation, the temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and the oxy- gen saturation 94% while he was breathing ambient air. There were crackles in both lung bases and in the right middle lung field, with no wheezes. Blood levels of electrolytes and lactate dehydrogenase were normal, as were the results of liver-function and kidney-function tests and urinalysis; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Fig. 2A)\nshowed multifocal reticulonodular and patchy opacities, which were confluent in the right lower lobe. CT of the chest (Fig. 2B and 2C), performed without the administration of intra- venous contrast material, revealed multifocal clustered, centrilobular nodules and opacities in a tree-in-bud pattern with scattered areas of fo- cal consolidation that were present predomi- nantly in the right middle and lower lobes. There was associated mild mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy that had not been present on the previous chest CT examination.\nDr. Alba: The patient was again admitted to\nthis hospital, and additional testing was per- formed. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and anti\u2013double-stranded DNA anti- bodies were negative, and blood levels of C3 and C4 were normal. A urine test for legionella anti- gen was negative.\nOn the third hospital day, a bronchoscopy and a transbronchial biopsy were performed. The bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) fluid obtained from the right middle lobe was cloudy; analysis of the fluid revealed 888 nucleated cells per microliter (of which 48% were neutrophils and 2% were lymphocytes, with no eosinophils). Gram\u2019s stain- ing of the BAL f luid revealed neutrophils and sparse growth of gram-positive cocci. Staining for acid-fast organisms was negative; culture grew normal respiratory flora and C. albicans. Tests of the BAL fluid for influenza virus, adeno- virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, P. jirovecii, histo- plasma antigen, and blastomyces antigen were negative, as were cultures for cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. An interferon-\u03b3 release assay for M. tuberculosis was also negative. The patient was discharged home on the third hos- pital day, with follow-up scheduled in the pul- monary clinic for 3 weeks later.\nFour days after the patient was discharged, a BAL test for galactomannan returned a positive result (antigen index, \u22653.750; negative test, <0.5), and the patient was readmitted to this hospital. He reported ongoing dyspnea, cough with thick white sputum, and persistent fever with a tem- perature of up to 39.3\u00b0C. A review of systems was notable for diffuse chronic arthralgias, a bitter taste in the mouth, and intermittent dys- phagia. There was no chest pain, edema, orthop- nea, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, or rash, and he had no known current sick contacts. The weight was 5 kg lower than that recorded 1 year earlier. Medical history was notable for polyarteritis nodosa, deep venous thrombosis, gastroesopha- geal reflux disease (GERD), pancreatitis in the context of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, dys- lipidemia, diabetes mellitus, osteopenia, and chronic neuropathic pain. Medications included aspirin, prednisone, methotrexate, trimethoprim\u2013 sulfamethoxazole, folate supplementation, met- formin, atenolol, simvastatin, pregabalin, and as-needed oxycodone, as well as inhaled flutica- sone\u2013salmeterol and albuterol as needed. Lisino- pril had reportedly caused pancreatic inflam- mation; there were no other known adverse reactions to medications. The patient was of White European ancestry. He lived in New England with his wife and was retired from an office position. Three decades earlier, he had worked in a machine shop where solvents, fuels, and sulfur compounds were used but had had no known exposure to these agents. There was no history of exposure to mold, pets, or asbestos. He had received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. He and his wife had traveled within the United States and to the Caribbean. He had smoked 1.5 packs of cigarettes per day for 30 years but had quit in the weeks before the cur- rent admission. He had previously smoked mari- juana, rarely consumed alcohol, and never used other substances. There was no family history of autoimmune or pulmonary disease; his father had died from colorectal cancer, and his mother had had esophageal cancer and had died after a stroke. His three adult children were healthy.\nThe temperature was 36.6\u00b0C, the heart rate 75  beats per minute, the blood pressure 135/69 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per min- ute, and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 6 liters per minute. He had a slightly cushingoid appearance and was tachypneic, although he was able to speak in full sentences. Auscultation of the chest re- vealed rales at the right lung base, rhonchi dur- ing both the inspiratory and expiratory phases that were more pronounced in the right lung than in the left lung, and intermittent inspira- tory wheezing in the right lung. The rest of the examination was normal.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: A chest radiograph (Fig. 2D)\nshowed progression of the diffuse bilateral reticu- lonodular opacities, with additional patchy opaci- ties in the right lung and left lower lobe, as com- pared with the image obtained 1 week earlier.\nDr. Alba: Blood levels of electrolytes, amylase, lipase, N-terminal pro\u2013B-type natriuretic pep- tide, and troponin T were normal, as were the results of tests of kidney and liver function; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Urinalysis was normal, and a urine test for legionella antigen was negative.\nThe BAL-fluid culture obtained during the previous admission grew enterococcus species,\nC. albicans, and C. glabrata; no mycobacteria grew in any of three induced sputum samples ob- tained during the previous admission. Empirical treatment with intravenous voriconazole was initiated, and ongoing treatment with metho- trexate was interrupted.\nCytologic analysis of the BAL fluid and the transbronchial-biopsy specimen obtained during the previous admission revealed evidence of acute inflammation, bronchial columnar cells, and pulmonary macrophages. There were no malig- nant cells. Evaluation of the bronchial mucosa revealed no abnormalities.\nOn the second hospital day, the temperature was 37.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 91% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute.\nDr. Harvey Barnes: Repeat CT of the chest (Fig. 2E and 2F) was performed after the admin- istration of intravenous contrast material as part of a pulmonary embolism protocol. This imag- ing study revealed extensive centrilobular pulmonary nodules, opacities in a tree-in-bud pat- tern, and patchy ground-glass opacities. There was bronchial wall thickening with mucus plug- ging, predominantly affecting the lower lobes. There were additional areas of nodular consoli- dation that were more prominent in the right lung than in the left lung. These findings indi- cated a progression of disease as compared with the chest CT performed 1 week before the cur- rent admission. There was no evidence of pul- monary embolism.\nDr. Alba: Additional induced sputum samples were obtained for culture; Gram\u2019s staining re- vealed abundant neutrophils and abundant mixed gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.\nOn the third hospital day, the temperature was 36.9\u00b0C and the oxygen saturation 96% while the patient was receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute.\n\nTable 1.

A frontal chest radio\u2011 graph obtained during the current admission (Panel D) shows progression of the diffuse reticulonodular opaci\u2011 ties bilaterally, with additional patchy opacities through\u2011 out the right lung and left lower lobe, as compared with the previous chest radiograph obtained 1 week earlier. Axial (Panel E) and coronal (Panel F) chest CT images obtained during the current admission show increased diffuse centrilobular nodules and tree\u2011in\u2011bud nodularity, patchy ground\u2011glass opacities (arrow), and additional areas of consolidation (arrowheads) that are more prom\u2011 inent in the right lung than in the left lung; these find\u2011 ings indicate a progression of disease, as compared with the chest CT images obtained 1 week before the current admission (Panels B and C).\n",
    "Differential Diagnosis": "",
    "Differential diagnosis content": "Dr. Rachel S. Knipe: This 57-year-old immunosup- pressed man with polyarteritis nodosa presents with a waxing and waning pneumonia syndrome that is characterized by centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodularity on chest imaging. Polyarteritis nodosa is a medium-vessel vasculi- tis that can affect the kidneys, skin, nerves, muscles, and gastrointestinal tract but notably does not cause disease in the lungs. Therefore, I will develop a differential diagnosis based on the high likelihood that this patient\u2019s condition is caused by an alternative process, and I will rely heavily on the radiographic findings to nar- row the list of possible diagnoses.\n\nInfection\nThis patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with a typical bacterial pneumonia, but pneu- monia caused by an atypical organism such as mycoplasma should be considered. Although mycoplasma pneumonia is typically character- ized by patchy reticulonodular and ground- glass opacities, it can also be manifested by centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodular- ity. However, this patient\u2019s symptoms did not resolve after he received levofloxacin, which is highly effective in treating mycoplasma; thus,mycoplasma pneumonia is an unlikely diag- nosis.\nNocardia is a slow-growing modified acid- fast bacterium with tropism for the lungs and brain. Risk factors include immunosuppression, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cancer, and diabetes. Radiographic imaging studies typically show single or multiple pulmo- nary nodules in the upper lobes that may cavi- tate. However, this patient had multiple sputum and BAL-fluid cultures that were negative, which makes a diagnosis of nocardiosis unlikely.\nFungal infection, particularly due to aspergil- lus, should be considered because of the positive BAL test for galactomannan. The galactoman- nan test recognizes a polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall. The test is only 81% specific for invasive aspergillus, with positive tests often occurring in the presence of other fungi that share cross-reacting antigens such as fusarium or penicillium.1 False positive results can also occur because of fungal colonization in the airways, aspiration of contaminated food particles, contaminated BAL fluid or blood prod- ucts, or the use of antibiotic agents such as piperacillin\u2013tazobactam.2 Although ubiquitous\n \nin nature, aspergillus species tend to cause inva- sive disease in the presence of severe immuno- suppression. The lung is the most common site of infection, and chest imaging often shows multiple cavitary nodules. Aspergillus is angio- invasive, and nodules are often surrounded by a \u201chalo\u201d of ground glass, a finding that indicates hemorrhage into surrounding tissue. Despite the positive test for galactomannan, the radiograph- ic findings in this case are not suggestive of aspergillus.\nP. jirovecii pneumonia is an opportunistic fun- gal infection that is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients. This patient re- ceived prophylactic trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxa- zole, which markedly reduces the risk of P. jirove- cii pneumonia and nocardia infection. Typical radiographic findings include diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates with ground-glass opaci- ties, which often cavitate and become cystic. Although this patient\u2019s blood 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan test was positive, a finding that is often sugges- tive of P. jirovecii pneumonia, his imaging find- ings are not typical of this condition, and the BAL f luid and several induced sputum speci- mens were negative for P. jirovecii; therefore, this diagnosis can be ruled out.\nCandida is part of the normal flora of the\ngastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts, but invasive disease occurs in the context of severe immunosuppression. Candida pneumonia is rare- ly diagnosed; because the majority of candida growth in BAL fluid is correctly attributed to colonization, it is difficult to identify cases of pathogenic growth of candida in the lung with- out histologic confirmation.3 Lung biopsy could identify invasive disease, but it is rarely per- formed in such cases. Imaging typically shows bilateral nodules and consolidation, but centri- lobular nodules and tree-in-bud nodularity have been reported. In this case, there is evidence of candida colonization identified from specimens obtained during bronchoscopy and sputum sam- pling, and the blood 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan test was positive; therefore, invasive candida pneumonia cannot be ruled out.\nThe  1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan  test is less specific for\naspergillus than the galactomannan test, be- cause this compound is present in the cell wall of many yeasts and molds, such as P. jirovecii, candida species, fusarium, and acremonium. False positive test results can also occur in the presence of cellulose membrane, which is used for hemodialysis, intravenous immune globulin treatment, and albumin therapy and is also found in surgical gauze.\nThe radiographic abnormalities seen in this patient are also consistent with mycobacterial disease. The lungs are a primary site of infection in patients with tuberculosis; however, this pa- tient had no known exposure to a person with active tuberculosis, and multiple mycobacterial cultures and tests for latent tuberculosis were negative. Infection with nontuberculous myco- bacterium, which often complicates structural lung diseases such as bronchiectasis, should be considered; however, all this patient\u2019s mycobac- terial cultures were negative. Viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, para- influenza virus, and adenovirus can cause a dif- fuse centrilobular and tree-in-bud nodular pat- tern on imaging. However, viral studies of the BAL fluid were negative.\nInterstitial Lung Disease\nGiven that no fibrotic changes were noted on chest imaging, I narrowed my focus to inflam- matory interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) that can cause centrilobular nodules. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an immune response in the lungs to inhaled antigens, can have a waxing and wan- ing clinical course, since symptoms flare with antigen exposure. However, the imaging find- ings in this case are only partially consistent with a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumoni- tis. Centrilobular nodules are classically associ- ated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, but tree- in-bud nodularity is not. In this patient, there was no evidence of mosaic attenuation or air trapping and no clear environmental exposure; there was no lymphocytosis identified on analy- sis of the BAL fluid, which is characteristic of \u2014 although not specific for \u2014 hypersensitivity\npneumonitis.\nSimilar to hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sar- coidosis is a granulomatous reaction and can involve any part of the body, with the lungs, skin, joints, and eyes being most affected. How- ever, the imaging findings in this case are not consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, be- cause the nodules are not in a perilymphatic\n \n\ndistribution and there is no clinically significant hilar lymphadenopathy.\nOrganizing pneumonia is an inflammatory reaction in the lung to injury that can be due to infection, connective-tissue disease, cancer, or medications, or it can be cryptogenic. This pa- tient\u2019s waxing and waning clinical course is con- sistent with organizing pneumonia, but imaging typically shows peripheral and peribronchovas- cular nodular consolidations. Respiratory bron- chiolitis\u2013associated ILD is a smoking-related ILD that is manifested by dyspnea but not by fever and productive cough, which were seen in this patient. This patient\u2019s imaging is also not fully consistent with a diagnosis of respiratory bron- chiolitis\u2013associated ILD, since patients usually present with a predominant pattern of air trap- ping and ground-glass opacities and, less com- monly, centrilobular nodules.\nSeveral lymphoproliferative ILDs, including\nlymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, should also be considered. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumo- nia is often associated with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome or HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection and is character- ized by the presence of cysts on imaging. Fol- licular bronchiolitis is a lymphoid proliferation of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue that is also usually associated with Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome or HIV-1 infection. Although this patient\u2019s imag- ing findings, which included centrilobular nod- ules and tree-in-bud nodularity, are consistent with follicular bronchiolitis, his clinical presen- tation, which included fever and productive cough, is not. Diffuse panbronchiolitis is rarely diagnosed in persons who are not of Asian an- cestry, and this patient was of White European ancestry.\n\nDrug-Related Toxic Effect\nThis patient received treatment with cyclophos- phamide and methotrexate. Reports of pulmo- nary toxic effects associated with the use of cy- clophosphamide are rare; however, when acute pneumonitis occurs, it usually develops within the first 6 months of treatment, and when chronic pneumonitis occurs, it is characterized by fibrosis, which was not seen on this patient\u2019s imaging studies. Methotrexate can cause a dif- fuse pneumonitis, but this usually occurs during the first year of treatment. None of these fea- tures fit the temporal or radiographic pattern described in this case.\nCancer\nIt is important to consider cancer in any case involving persistent lung opacities. Primary lung cancer is typically manifested by discrete nod- ules and lymphadenopathy. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a rare pulmonary lymphoma that is associated with Epstein\u2013Barr virus, has been reported to occur in the context of methotrexate therapy. Imaging typically shows single or mul- tiple nodules that can cavitate in a peribroncho- vascular distribution. Tumor embolization is char- acterized by nodules in a random distribution, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis is character- ized by nodules in a perilymphatic distribution. None of these diagnoses fit with this patient\u2019s radiographic pattern.\n\nRecurrent Aspiration\nIn pulmonary medicine, we have a saying that \u201ceveryone aspirates.\u201d Aspiration can be clinically silent and can occur even in the absence of overt reflux symptoms. The centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud pattern of opacities seen on this pa- tient\u2019s imaging studies are consistent with aspi- ration. In addition, this patient had secretions in the airways, mucus plugging, a hiatal hernia, and some residual contrast material in the esophagus, all of which are suggestive of aspiration of oral and gastric contents into the airways. His clini- cal history, especially the history of GERD and a bitter taste in the mouth, suggests the occurrence of aspiration. This patient\u2019s waxing and waning clinical course would also be consistent with aspiration into the airways. The BAL fluid was notable for acute inflammation and the presence of squamous cells, candida, and bacteria, findings that are consistent with \u2014 although not specific for \u2014 aspiration of oral contents. Given this presentation, additional testing is warranted.\nOn the basis of this patient\u2019s clinical presen- tation and radiographic evaluation, infectious and aspiration bronchiolitis are the most likely diagnoses in this case. A thorough microbio- logic workup was negative except for the fungal markers. The clinical and radiographic presenta- tions are most consistent with a diffuse aspira- tion bronchiolitis; however, given this patient\u2019s degree of immunosuppression and positive fun- gal markers, I would proceed with a lung biopsy to rule out fungal pneumonia and to confirm the diagnosis of aspiration bronchiolitis.\n\n\n\n\n",

Numerous foci of peribronchiolar histiocytes and giant cells formed intraluminal polypoid structures that obstructed the bronchiolar lumina. Rare foci of foreign material that were consistent with aspi- rated food particles were identified. There was associated focal microabscess formation and organizing fibrosis. Fibrinous pleuritis was also present. The background lung parenchyma showed numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages within the alveolar spaces and associated interstitial fibrosis.
